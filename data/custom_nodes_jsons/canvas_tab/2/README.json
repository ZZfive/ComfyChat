        "question": "What is the default view in the canvas used for in the turbo workflow?",
        "answer": "The default view in the canvas is initialized to provide two imagesâ€”Image A, sent to the canvas node, and Image B, which has a layer set as the target for new generations. This initial setup allows users to start with a simple scribble in Image A and use the duplicate layer functionality to refine the work incrementally, with the ability to base new generations on previously generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the duplicate layer button in the turbo workflow?",
        "answer": "The duplicate layer button is used to copy an image from Image A to be used as a base in Image B. This way, users can keep refining their work without losing the base image that caused it."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the workflow assist in reducing blurriness?",
        "answer": "If the image begins to blur during iterations, the workflow contains a sharpening node that can be activated to sharpen the image for a single generation. This generates a sharper output that can then be used as a new source image for further refinement."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ControlLLite depthmap model' in the Multi Canvas with ControlNet workflow?",
        "answer": "The ControlLLite depthmap model is used to create depthmap images which can be utilized in combination with the Multi Canvas work mode. Depthmaps are useful in creating 3D effects or adding depth to scenes in a canvas by providing additional guidance for the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should a user do with the 'depth unit' in the Multi Canvas with ControlNet workflow?",
        "answer": "When a user drops a generated image into the depth unit of the workflow, a calculated depthmap can be acquired. This allows for refining depthmaps manually by calculating depth from a generated image, which can then be iterated upon or used in conjunction with a manually drawn depthmap to achieve better results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of multi-target functionality in relative terms?",
        "answer": "Multi-target functioning in this context refers to the ability to have multiple canvases acting as targets for image generation. This can be useful for generating multiple related images in different stages of a process, or for experiments with varying targets to observe the effects on output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can sharpening nodes be useful in workflow troubleshooting?",
        "answer": "Sharpening nodes in the workflow are helpful in mitigating issues where images may start to become blurred over iterations, particularly when generating images based on previous generations. By activating the sharpening node, users can ensure that their output remains clear and detailed, which is essential for detailed artistic work or refinement."
