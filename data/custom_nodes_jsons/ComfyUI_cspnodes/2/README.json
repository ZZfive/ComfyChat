        "answer": "The TextFileLineIterator node iterates through lines in a text file, allowing you to retrieve a specific line based on its index."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you control the selection of images in the ImageDirIterator node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageDirIterator node, you can control image selection through parameters like glob patterns, image index, sorting method and order, batch size, and randomization options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VidDirIterator node do?",
        "answer": "The VidDirIterator node iterates through video files in a directory or multiple directories, allowing you to select a specific video based on various sorting and selection options."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Modelscopet2v node generate video frames?",
        "answer": "The Modelscopet2v node generates video frames from text using the Modelscope text-to-video model, with parameters for the prompt, model path, inference steps, guidance scale, seed, and frame dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What transformation does the Modelscopev2v node perform?",
        "answer": "The Modelscopev2v node transforms video frames using the Modelscope video-to-video model, based on parameters like the input frames, prompt, model path, strength, inference steps, guidance scale, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the SplitImageChannels node?",
        "answer": "The SplitImageChannels node splits an input image into its red, green, and blue channels, outputting each channel as a grayscale image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RemapRange node work?",
        "answer": "The RemapRange node remaps a value from one range to another, using specified input and output ranges, and optionally clamping the output to the new range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ResizeByImage node?",
        "answer": "The ResizeByImage node resizes an input image to match the dimensions of a reference image, using the reference image's width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IncrementEveryN node calculate its output?",
        "answer": "The IncrementEveryN node takes an input integer and outputs a new integer that increments every N steps of the input, with an optional offset. It calculates the output by dividing the input value by the step size, adding the offset, and returning the integer result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the DepthToNormalMap node used for?",
        "answer": "The DepthToNormalMap node converts depth maps to normal maps, with options to control intensity, axis flipping, and depth scaling. It is designed to work consistently across different image resolutions."
