    {
        "question": "What are some of the available models in rembg-comfyui-node-better?",
        "answer": "Some available models in rembg-comfyui-node-better include u2net, u2netp, u2net_human_seg, u2net_cloth_seg, silueta, isnet-general-use, isnet-anime, and sam."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the u2net and u2netp models?",
        "answer": "The u2net model is a pre-trained model for general use cases, while u2netp is a lightweight version of the u2net model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model is specifically designed for anime character segmentation?",
        "answer": "The isnet-anime model is a high-accuracy segmentation model specifically designed for anime characters."
    },
    {
