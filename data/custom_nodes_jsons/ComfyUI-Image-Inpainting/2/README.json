        "answer": "To set up the custom nodes for ComfyUI, you need to:\n1. Clone the 'ComfyUI-Impact-Pack' repository into the 'custom_nodes/' directory.\n2. Clone the 'comfyui_controlnet_aux' repository into the 'custom_nodes/' directory.\n3. Download the necessary models and put them in their respective directories in the model hierarchy provided in the text."
