        "question": "How does the Text Prompt Combiner Node manipulate text dynamically?",
        "answer": "The Text Prompt Combiner Node dynamically replaces text in a template using `$attributeName` syntax to insert values from the API response. It also uses the `id_field_name` parameter to specify the attribute name whose value is returned as a string, aiding in identifying or referencing objects."

    {
        "question": "What are the requirements for the Image Post Node?",
        "answer": "The Image Post Node requires an image, an object ID as a string, and an API key for authentication. It also requires the `api_url` parameter, which is the endpoint for image posting, with `$id` used in the URL to dynamically insert the ID."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example workflow using the nodes provided by ComfyUI_API_Manager?",
        "answer": "An example workflow could involve fetching data from an API using the API Request Node, generating a dynamic text prompt based on the fetched data using the Text Prompt Combiner Node, and then posting an image related to that prompt to another API endpoint using the Image Post Node."
