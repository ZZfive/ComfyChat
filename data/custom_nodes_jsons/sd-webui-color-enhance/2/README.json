    {
        "question": "Which algorithm does the sd-webui-color-enhance script use for color enhancement?",
        "answer": "The sd-webui-color-enhance script uses the same algorithm as GIMP/GEGL for color enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the color enhancement algorithm work in sd-webui-color-enhance?",
        "answer": "The color enhancement algorithm in sd-webui-color-enhance converts the color space to CIELCh(ab) and normalizes the chroma (or 'colorfulness') component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of using sd-webui-color-enhance for color enhancement?",
        "answer": "By using sd-webui-color-enhance, users can select a VAE based on its true merit of accurately converting the latent space to a pixel representation of the image, rather than solely on color."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users enable the sd-webui-color-enhance script in the txt2img and img2img tabs?",
        "answer": "To enable the sd-webui-color-enhance script in the txt2img and img2img tabs, go to Settings -> Postprocessing, add the script to the 'Enable postprocessing operations in txt2img and img2img tabs' option, save, and restart the web UI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does using sd-webui-color-enhance cause any issues with other features like hires fix or inpainting?",
        "answer": "No, using sd-webui-color-enhance should not cause any issues with hires fix, inpainting, or other features, as postprocessing scripts are applied directly before returning the final image(s)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when sd-webui-color-enhance is applied at full strength to an already heavily saturated/colorful image?",
        "answer": "When sd-webui-color-enhance is applied at full strength to an already heavily saturated/colorful image, there should be essentially 0 change to the image, indicating how working in this color space removes the need to worry about oversaturating or blowing out an image."
