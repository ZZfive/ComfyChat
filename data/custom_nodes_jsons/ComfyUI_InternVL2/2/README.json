        "question": "What can InternVL2 do now with ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "InternVL2 can now be automatically loaded using the InternVL Model Loader node, perform dynamic resolution with the Dynamic Preprocess node, use transformers for native inference with the InternVL HF Inference node, and utilize the InternVL recommended LMDEPLOY inference with the InternVL LMDEPLOY Inference node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is InternVL2 integrated with ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "InternVL2 is integrated with ComfyUI by using the provided nodes. The InternVL Model Loader node automatically loads the InternVL model. The Dynamic Preprocess node enables dynamic resolution. The InternVL HF Inference node allows for native transformer inference, and the InternVL LMDEPLOY Inference node uses the recommended LMDEPLOY inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using InternVL2 with ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "By using InternVL2 with ComfyUI, one can benefit from improved performance and flexibility, including automatic loading of the InternVL model, support for dynamic resolution, and the use of transformers for native inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available nodes for ComfyUI that utilize InternVL2?",
        "answer": "The available nodes for ComfyUI that utilize InternVL2 are InternVL Model Loader, Dynamic Preprocess, InternVL HF Inference, and InternVL LMDEPLOY Inference."
