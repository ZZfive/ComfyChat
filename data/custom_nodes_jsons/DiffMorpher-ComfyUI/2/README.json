        "question": "What is DiffMorpher-ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "DiffMorpher-ComfyUI is a custom node for DiffMorpher that allows morphing between two images using Stable Diffusion in the ComfyUI interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DiffMorpherNode?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the DiffMorpherNode are: image_0, prompt_0, image_1, prompt_1, use_adain, use_reschedule, lamb, save_inter, num_frames, and duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lamb' parameter control in DiffMorpherNode?",
        "answer": "The 'lamb' parameter is a hyperparameter that controls the amount of self-attention replacement, where a larger value indicates more replacements. It ranges from 0 to 1 and defaults to 0.6."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default number of frames generated by DiffMorpherNode?",
        "answer": "By default, DiffMorpherNode generates 16 frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where are the intermediate frames saved when 'save_inter' is set to True?",
        "answer": "When 'save_inter' is set to True, the intermediate frames are saved in the 'ComfyUI/output/diffmorpher' directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default pretrained model used by DiffMorpherNode?",
        "answer": "The default pretrained model used by DiffMorpherNode is 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for DiffMorpherNode?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for DiffMorpherNode are 'diffusers_model', 'lora_0', and 'lora_1', which allow specifying a different pretrained model and LoRA directories for the two input images."
