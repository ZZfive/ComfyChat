        "question": "How can you use ComfyUI-TextOnSegs to write text on faces?",
        "answer": "To write text on faces using ComfyUI-TextOnSegs, you need to load the 'workflows/draw_text_on_face.json' file using drag and drop, change the values of the Text node and CalcMaxFontSize node in the 'Draw Text' group, and then run the workflow. If detection fails, an error will occur, but this is by design."
