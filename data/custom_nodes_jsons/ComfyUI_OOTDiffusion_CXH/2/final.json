You can verify this by checking the output of `python -c 'import torch; from torch.utils.cpp_extension import CUDA_HOME; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), CUDA_HOME)'`.\n   - If using Python 3.6 or higher, ensure that torchvision and detectron2 are installed accordingly with the correct CUDA package.\n   - If using Python 3.7 or later, torchvision and detectron2 need to be compiled with CUDA 11.7 or later to use the new DistributedDataParallel autograd functions.\n2. **Ensure CUDA Libraries Are Found:** Make sure that CUDA libraries are correctly installed and found during the build process. You can check this by logging the version of your CUDA such as:\n   - **GPU Compatibility:** Set the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` environment variable during compilation. For example, `export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=6.0,7.0` makes it compile for both P100s and V100s.\n   - **Separate CUDA Runtimes:** Use separate CUDA runtimes if needed, and check if all required dependencies are under version control and accessible by detectron2.\n   - **Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies such as pycocotools are installed.\n3. **Check for ONNX Compatibility:** If you encounter issues with ONNX conversion, make sure that you're using a recent compiler, which should be closer to the version used by PyTorch.\n4. **Compile FROM Source:** Always try to compile detectron2 from source, as issues like undefined symbols or segmentation faults often occur due to mismatches in dependencies or Python versions.\n5. **Google and Document Search:** If the issue still persists, utilize resources like the detectron2 GitHub page or the torchvision documentation to troubleshoot the specific errors you encounter."

If you are on macOS, use the following command:\n   ```bash\n   CC=clang CXX=clang++ python -m pip install detectron2\n   ```\n\n6. If rebuilding Detectron2 from a local clone, use:\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf build/**/*.so\n   ```\n\n7.

'Not compiled with GPU support' or 'Detectron2 CUDA Compiler: not available'.\n   - Ensure that CUDA libraries are found. Most models can run inference without GPU support. Set `MODEL.DEVICE='cpu'` in the config.\n4. 'invalid device function' or 'no kernel image is available for execution'.\n   - Check whether you have mismatched CUDA versions or unsupported GPU architectures.\n5.
