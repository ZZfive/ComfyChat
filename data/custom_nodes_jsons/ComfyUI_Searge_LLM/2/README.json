            "question": "What is the purpose of the Searge-LLM node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The Searge-LLM node is used as a prompt-generator or prompt-improvement node, utilizing a language model to turn a provided text-to-image prompt into a more detailed and improved prompt."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can the Searge_LLM_Node be configured in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The Searge_LLM_Node can be configured by setting the `text` (input text for the language model), `model` (directory name of the model within `models/llm_gguf` you wish to use), `max_tokens` (maximum number of tokens for the generated text), and `apply_instructions` (instructions to apply)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the advanced configuration options available for the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "The advanced configuration options include `temperature` (controls the randomness in text generation), `top_p` (controls the cumulative probability distribution cutoff), `top_k` (limits the number of highest probability tokens considered), and `repetition_penalty` (adjusts the likelihood of tokens already appeared in the output)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the MIT License and how does it apply to the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "The MIT License is an open-source license that provides users the ability to use, modify, and distribute the code for personal or commercial projects. The Searge_LLM_Node is released under this license, allowing users to adapt and build upon its functionality as they see fit."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can the Searge_AdvOptionsNode be used without the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "No, the Searge_AdvOptionsNode is used in conjunction with the Searge_LLM_Node to provide granular control over the text generation process and model behavior."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some potential problems when using the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "If the user encounters error messages about missing `llama-cpp`, they can follow specific manual steps to install the necessary package. This includes uninstalling any existing `llama_cpp` packages, manually installing the latest version of `llama_cpp-python`, and running the commands in the appropriate Python environment."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a custom extension in the context of ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "A custom extension in ComfyUI refers to a specific node or plugin that expands the functionality of the GUI, allowing users to add or modify features according to their needs. For example, the Searge LLM node is a custom extension that enhances text-to-image prompt generation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the default values for the `Searge_AdvOptionsNode`?",
            "answer": "The default values for the `Searge_AdvOptionsNode` are the same as those used by the Searge_LLM_Node, providing a starting point for users to adjust based on their specific use case."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does `top_p` control in the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "The `top_p` parameter controls the cumulative probability distribution cutoff in the text generation process. It determines the top percent of tokens with the highest probabilities that the model considers for sampling, helping to balance between diversity and quality in the generated prompts."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can a user request a specific feature for the Searge_LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "If a user has an idea for a new feature that they'd like to see implemented in the Searge_LLM_Node, they can post their idea in the issue tracker on GitHub as a feature request. If the creator of the node agrees and has the time, they may implement the requested feature in a future update."
