        "question": "What is ComfyUI-bleh?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-bleh is a collection of utility and model patching functions for ComfyUI, which also includes an improved previewer that allows previewing batches during generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some features of ComfyUI-bleh?",
        "answer": "Some features of ComfyUI-bleh include better TAESD previews, allowing setting seed, timestep range and step interval for HyperTile, applying Kohya Deep Shrink to multiple blocks, discarding penultimate sigma, switching between samplers during sampling, applying arbitrary model patches at an interval or percentage of sampling, and ensuring a seed is set even when add_noise is turned off in a sampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlehModelPatchConditional node in ComfyUI-bleh?",
        "answer": "The BlehModelPatchConditional node in ComfyUI-bleh allows applying model patches conditionally, such as applyingHyperTile, Self Attention Guidance or other arbitrary model patches when the interval or start/end percentage match."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BlehHyperTile node in ComfyUI-bleh differ from the original HyperTile node?",
        "answer": "The BlehHyperTile node in ComfyUI-bleh adds the ability to set a seed and timestep range that HyperTile gets applied for, as well as setting an interval for HyperTile steps. It is also possible to set a negative interval value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlehForceSeedSampler node in ComfyUI-bleh?",
        "answer": "The BlehForceSeedSampler node in ComfyUI-bleh wraps another sampler and ensures that the seed gets set, even when add_noise is turned off in samplers like euler_a."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BlehDeepShrink node in ComfyUI-bleh differ from the built-in Deep Shrink node?",
        "answer": "The BlehDeepShrink node in ComfyUI-bleh allows entering a comma-separated list of blocks to apply the downscale effect to, adds a start_fadeout_percent input to scale the downscale effect, and expands the options for upscale and downscale types with the ability to turn on antialiasing for bicubic and bilinear modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlehInsaneChainSampler node in ComfyUI-bleh?",
        "answer": "The BlehInsaneChainSampler node in ComfyUI-bleh allows more conveniently switching between samplers during sampling by chaining a bunch of samplers together and manually setting the start/end steps."
