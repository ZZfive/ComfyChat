        "question": "What is the purpose of antrobots ComfyUI Nodepack?",
        "answer": "The antrobots ComfyUI Nodepack is a compilation of custom nodes that implement functionality that the creator finds lacking or obtuse in ComfyUI."

        "question": "What does the KSampler (advanced) with denoise node do?",
        "answer": "The KSampler (advanced) with denoise node is a variant of the built-in KSampler (advanced) that allows you to provide a `denoise` value, enabling more efficient model swapping mid-generation in img-to-img workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Swap node work in the antrobots ComfyUI Nodepack?",
        "answer": "The Swap node takes two inputs and either maps input 1 to output A and input 2 to output B (if swap bool is `False`) or swaps the outputs, mapping 1 to B and 2 to A (if swap bool is `True`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Crop Image and Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image and Mask node is used to crop an image and its corresponding mask based on the provided minimum width, minimum height, and padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Paste with Masks node do?",
        "answer": "The Paste with Masks node pastes a source image onto a destination image using masks, treating the source mask as an alpha channel and using the destination mask as the area to paste onto."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Set Dict node in the antrobots ComfyUI Nodepack?",
        "answer": "The Set Dict node packages values into a `DICT` labeled as `key` and sends it out. If a `dict` is passed in, it appends the value to the input dict."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Get Dict Unsafe node differ from the standard Get Dict node?",
        "answer": "The Get Dict Unsafe node does not have a `default` value. If the input does not exist, it will return `None`, which can be useful when working with custom types but may cause workflows to break if the key does not exist."
