        "question": "What does a sensitivity level of 0.5 indicate in the safety checker node?",
        "answer": "A sensitivity level of 0.5 in the ComfyUI-safety-checker node represents the detection threshold for explicit nudity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is detected at a sensitivity level of 1.0 in the safety checker node?",
        "answer": "At a sensitivity level of 1.0, the ComfyUI-safety-checker node is capable of detecting images containing lingerie or underwear."
