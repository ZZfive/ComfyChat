        "question": "What is Neural Neighbor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Neural Neighbor is a paper-based style transfer method that utilizes a neural network to generate style transfers. It is a part of the ComfyUI workflow and can be used for both images and videos, though it is generally not recommended for batched inputs such as videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the arguments for Neural Neighbor?",
        "answer": "The Neural Neighbor method has several arguments that can be used to control its behavior. These include `size`, which determines the resolution of the input images; `scale_long`, which determines whether images are scaled by the longest or shortest side; and `flip`, which can be used to augment the style image by rotating it, potentially improving content preservation at the cost of slightly decreased stylization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Neural Neighbor generate style transfers?",
        "answer": "Neural Neighbor generates style transfers by scaling the input images to a desired resolution, augmenting the style image by rotating it, and then computing a content loss and style loss between the content image and the style image, respectively. The model then optimizes the style transfer using an adversarial training approach, where the style transfer network is trained to minimize the style loss and the discriminator network is trained to minimize the content loss."

    {
        "question": "How can Neural Neighbor be used for video style transfer?",
        "answer": "While Neural Neighbor is generally not recommended for batched inputs such as videos, it is possible to use the output style frames generated using ComfyUI-EbSynth to propagate the style across the entire video. This can be done by running Neural Neighbor on each style frame independently and then concatenating the style frames to form the final video output."
