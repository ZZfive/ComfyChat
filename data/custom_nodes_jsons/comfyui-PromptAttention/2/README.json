        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension is designed to address the issue of contextual words in a prompt affecting later or irrelevant parts of the prompt by utilizing attention masks to limit the transformer's attention to specific tokens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is causal attention masking in the standard transformer implementation?",
        "answer": "Causal attention masking is a built-in feature in the standard transformer implementation that masks out future tokens from the current token's attention, allowing the transformer to predict the next word without seeing the future."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension work?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension allows users to specify relationships in the prompt using parentheses, `<` and `>` to denote relationships between words or parts of the prompt, making it so that specific properties only apply to certain elements of the prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'CLIP Directional Prompt Attention Encode' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'CLIP Directional Prompt Attention Encode' node is introduced in the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension, allowing the use of `>` and `<` in the prompt to denote relationships between words or parts of the prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations of the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension is not compatible with the SD XL update and is not updated due to its limited contribution. Additionally, replacing the causal attention mask with a full attention mask is experimental and not the intended use for which the model was trained."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the prerequisites for using the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension?",
        "answer": "To use the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension, users need to have `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib` installed in their ComfyUI environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension and the ComfyUI-Cutoff extension?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-Cutoff extension tries to solve the issue of contextual words affecting irrelevant parts of the prompt through isolated prompt masking, while the ComfyUI-PromptAttention extension achieves this by using attention masks to limit the transformer's attention to specific tokens."
