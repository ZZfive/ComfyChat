        "question": "What is Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example is a method for exemplar-guided image editing using diffusion models, which allows for more precise control compared to language-guided image editing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of using self-supervised training in Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "Self-supervised training is used in Paint by Example to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Paint by Example avoid fusing artifacts?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example avoids fusing artifacts by using an information bottleneck and strong augmentations to prevent the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is used to ensure controllability in the editing process of Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example ensures controllability in the editing process by designing an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leveraging the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many forwards of the diffusion model are involved in the Paint by Example framework?",
        "answer": "The whole framework of Paint by Example involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any iterative optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase of Paint by Example be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase of Paint by Example can be found at Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which checkpoint is the Paint by Example model warm-started from?",
        "answer": "The Paint by Example model is warm-started from the CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 checkpoint to inpaint partly masked images conditioned on example and reference images."
