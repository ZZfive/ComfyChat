        "question": "What is ControlNet?",
        "answer": "ControlNet is a neural network architecture that adds spatial conditioning controls to large, pretrained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion XL."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ControlNet condition and control Stable Diffusion generation?",
        "answer": "ControlNet conditions and controls Stable Diffusion generation by providing an additional control image, such as a depth map, which preserves the spatial information from the control image in the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some examples of conditioning controls that can be used with ControlNet?",
        "answer": "Some examples of conditioning controls that can be used with ControlNet include edges, depth, segmentation, and human pose."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can ControlNet be used with single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts?",
        "answer": "Yes, ControlNet can be used with single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the training of ControlNets robust with small and large datasets?",
        "answer": "Yes, the training of ControlNets is robust with small (<50k) and large (>1m) datasets."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can additional smaller Stable Diffusion XL ControlNet checkpoints be found?",
        "answer": "Additional smaller Stable Diffusion XL ControlNet checkpoints can be found from the ðŸ¤— Diffusers Hub organization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I train my own Stable Diffusion XL ControlNet?",
        "answer": "You can train your own Stable Diffusion XL ControlNet using the training script provided in the examples/controlnet/README_sdxl directory."
