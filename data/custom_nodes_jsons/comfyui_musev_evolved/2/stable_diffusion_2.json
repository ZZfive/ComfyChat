        "question": "What is Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 is a text-to-image latent diffusion model built upon the work of the original Stable Diffusion, led by Robin Rombach and Katherine Crowson from Stability AI and LAION."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default resolution of the images generated by Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "The text-to-image models in Stable Diffusion 2 release can generate images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dataset is used to train Stable Diffusion 2 models?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the LAION-5B dataset created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using LAION's NSFW filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What scheduler is recommended for Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "The DPMSolverMultistepScheduler is recommended for Stable Diffusion 2 as it gives a reasonable speed/quality trade-off and can be run with as little as 20 steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What tasks can Stable Diffusion 2 be used for?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 can be used for tasks like text-to-image, inpainting, super-resolution, and depth-to-image."

    {
        "question": "Which organizations should be explored for using official checkpoints in Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "If you're interested in using one of the official checkpoints for a task, explore the CompVis, Runway, and Stability AI Hub organizations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline in the super-resolution task?",
        "answer": "The StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline is used in the super-resolution task to upscale a low resolution image to a higher resolution based on a given prompt."
