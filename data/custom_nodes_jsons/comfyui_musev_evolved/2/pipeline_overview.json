    {
        "question": "How can the generation process be better controlled?",
        "answer": "The generation process can be better controlled by setting seeds for reproducibility and assigning weights to certain words in the prompt to adjust their influence on the output."

    {
        "question": "How does the pipeline automatically detect the pipeline type?",
        "answer": "When a checkpoint is passed, the pipeline automatically detects the pipeline type and loads the necessary components."
