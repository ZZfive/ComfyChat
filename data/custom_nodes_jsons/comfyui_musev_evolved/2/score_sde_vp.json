        "question": "What is ScoreSdeVpScheduler?",
        "answer": "ScoreSdeVpScheduler is a variance preserving stochastic differential equation (SDE) scheduler introduced in the 'Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations' paper."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ScoreSdeVpScheduler do?",
        "answer": "The ScoreSdeVpScheduler smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and uses a corresponding reverse-time SDE to transform the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the reverse-time SDE in ScoreSdeVpScheduler depend on?",
        "answer": "The reverse-time SDE in ScoreSdeVpScheduler depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (also known as score) of the perturbed data distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ScoreSdeVpScheduler leverage advances in score-based generative modeling?",
        "answer": "ScoreSdeVpScheduler leverages advances in score-based generative modeling by accurately estimating scores with neural networks and using numerical SDE solvers to generate samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What new capabilities does the ScoreSdeVpScheduler framework allow for?",
        "answer": "The ScoreSdeVpScheduler framework allows for new sampling procedures, new modeling capabilities, a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors, an equivalent neural ODE for exact likelihood computation and improved sampling efficiency, and a new way to solve inverse problems."

    {
        "question": "What record-breaking performance does ScoreSdeVpScheduler achieve for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10?",
        "answer": "ScoreSdeVpScheduler achieves an Inception score of 9.89, an FID of 2.20, and a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10."
    },
    {
        "question": "What high fidelity generation does ScoreSdeVpScheduler demonstrate for the first time from a score-based generative model?",
        "answer": "ScoreSdeVpScheduler demonstrates high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model."
