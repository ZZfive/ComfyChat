    {
        "question": "What is Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN) in Attend-and-Excite?",
        "answer": "Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN) is a concept introduced in Attend-and-Excite, where the model intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time to improve the faithfulness of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Attend-and-Excite guide the model to refine the cross-attention units?",
        "answer": "Attend-and-Excite guides the model to refine the cross-attention units by encouraging them to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthening - or exciting - their activations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the failure cases that Attend-and-Excite aims to mitigate?",
        "answer": "Attend-and-Excite aims to mitigate failure cases such as catastrophic neglect, where the model fails to generate one or more of the subjects from the input prompt, and incorrect binding of attributes to their corresponding subjects."
