        "question": "What is Pix2Pix Zero?",
        "answer": "Pix2Pix Zero is a method for image-to-image translation that preserves the content of the original image without manual prompting. It automatically discovers editing directions that reflect desired edits in the text embedding space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Pix2Pix Zero preserve the content structure of the input image?",
        "answer": "Pix2Pix Zero uses cross-attention guidance, which aims to retain the cross-attention maps of the input image throughout the diffusion process to preserve the general content structure after editing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does Pix2Pix Zero require additional training for image editing?",
        "answer": "No, Pix2Pix Zero does not need additional training for edits and can directly use the existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two arguments exposed by the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline for controlling the direction of semantic edits?",
        "answer": "The two arguments exposed by the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline for controlling the direction of semantic edits are `source_embeds` and `target_embeds`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the quality of outputs generated with the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline be improved?",
        "answer": "The quality of the outputs generated with the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline is dependent on how good the `source_embeds` and `target_embeds` are. Generating high-quality source and target embeddings can improve the output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which pipeline is available for text-based image editing using Pix2Pix Zero?",
        "answer": "The StableDiffusionPix2PixZeroPipeline is available for text-based image editing using Pix2Pix Zero."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline be conditioned on real input images?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Pix2Pix Zero pipeline can be conditioned on real input images."
