        "question": "What is unconditional image generation?",
        "answer": "Unconditional image generation is a process of generating images that are similar to the training data distribution without any conditions such as text or images, unlike text-to-image or image-to-image models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be done before running the training scripts for unconditional image generation?",
        "answer": "Before running the training scripts, you need to install the dependency libraries and initialize the ðŸ¤— Accelerate environment."

    {
        "question": "How can you upload your model to the hub?",
        "answer": "You can upload your model to the hub by adding the '--push_to_hub' argument to the training script."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it recommended to save checkpoints regularly during training?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to save checkpoints regularly during training to prepare for any issues that may arise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you resume training from a checkpoint?",
        "answer": "You can resume training from a checkpoint by passing the '--resume_from_checkpoint' argument with the checkpoint name to the training script."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the '--dataset_name' argument in the training script?",
        "answer": "The '--dataset_name' argument is used to specify the dataset name for fine-tuning in the training script."
