        "question": "What is RePaintScheduler?",
        "answer": "RePaintScheduler is a DDPM-based inpainting scheduler for unsupervised inpainting with extreme masks. It is designed to be used with the RePaintPipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What paper is RePaintScheduler based on?",
        "answer": "RePaintScheduler is based on the paper 'RePaint: Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models' by Andreas Lugmayr et al."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the goal of RePaint?",
        "answer": "The goal of RePaint is to perform free-form inpainting, which is the task of adding new content to an image in the regions specified by an arbitrary binary mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does RePaint condition the generation process?",
        "answer": "RePaint conditions the generation process by altering the reverse diffusion iterations and sampling the unmasked regions using the given image information."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does RePaint modify or condition the original DDPM network?",
        "answer": "No, RePaint does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of images has RePaint been validated for?",
        "answer": "RePaint has been validated for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does RePaint perform compared to other state-of-the-art approaches?",
        "answer": "RePaint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original implementation of RePaint be found?",
        "answer": "The original implementation of RePaint can be found at the GitHub repository 'andreas128/RePaint'."
