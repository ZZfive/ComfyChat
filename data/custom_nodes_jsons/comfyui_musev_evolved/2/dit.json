        "question": "What is the purpose of the DiT paper?",
        "answer": "The DiT paper explores a new class of diffusion models based on the transformer architecture, training latent diffusion models of images and replacing the commonly-used U-Net backbone with a transformer that operates on latent patches."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the scalability of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) analyzed in the paper?",
        "answer": "The scalability of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is analyzed through the lens of forward pass complexity as measured by Gflops. The paper finds that DiTs with higher Gflops, through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens, consistently have lower FID."
    },
    {
        "question": "What benchmarks do the largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform prior diffusion models on?",
        "answer": "The largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform all prior diffusion models on the class-conditional ImageNet 512x512 and 256x256 benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 2.27 on the latter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase for DiT be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for DiT can be found at facebookresearch/dit on GitHub."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Schedulers guide?",
        "answer": "The Schedulers guide is meant to teach users how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality."

    {
        "question": "What can be learned from the 'reuse components across pipelines' section?",
        "answer": "The 'reuse components across pipelines' section teaches users how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two main classes documented in the provided text?",
        "answer": "The two main classes documented in the provided text are DiTPipeline and ImagePipelineOutput."
