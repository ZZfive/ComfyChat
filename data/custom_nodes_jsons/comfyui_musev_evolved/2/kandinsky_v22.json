    {
        "question": "What are the main improvements in Kandinsky 2.2 compared to its predecessor?",
        "answer": "The main improvements in Kandinsky 2.2 include a more powerful image encoder called CLIP-ViT-G and the addition of the ControlNet mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIP-ViT-G image encoder enhance Kandinsky 2.2's performance?",
        "answer": "The CLIP-ViT-G image encoder significantly increases Kandinsky 2.2's capability to generate more aesthetic pictures and better understand text, thus enhancing the model's overall performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the addition of ControlNet mechanism allow Kandinsky 2.2 to do?",
        "answer": "The addition of the ControlNet mechanism allows Kandinsky 2.2 to effectively control the process of generating images, leading to more accurate and visually appealing outputs and opening new possibilities for text-guided image manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase for Kandinsky 2.2 be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for Kandinsky 2.2 can be found at the ai-forever/Kandinsky-2 GitHub repository."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can official model checkpoints for tasks like text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting be found for Kandinsky 2.2?",
        "answer": "Official model checkpoints for tasks like text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting can be found at the Kandinsky Community organization on the Hub."
