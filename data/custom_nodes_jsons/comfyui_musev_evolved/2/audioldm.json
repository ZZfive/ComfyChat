        "question": "What is AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM is a text-to-audio latent diffusion model that learns continuous audio representations from CLAP latents. It takes a text prompt as input and predicts the corresponding audio, able to generate text-conditional sound effects, human speech and music."
    },
    {
        "question": "What was the inspiration for AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM was inspired by Stable Diffusion, a latent diffusion model that learns continuous representations from visual information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of AudioLDM compared to previous text-to-audio systems?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM achieves better generation quality and computational efficiency compared to previous text-to-audio systems by learning latent representations of audio signals and their compositions without modeling the cross-modal relationship."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the quality of the predicted audio sample controlled during inference in AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "The quality of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by the 'num_inference_steps' argument in AudioLDM. Higher steps give higher quality audio at the expense of slower inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the length of the predicted audio sample be controlled in AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "The length of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by varying the 'audio_length_in_s' argument in AudioLDM."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips for constructing effective prompts for AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "When constructing prompts for AudioLDM, it's best to use descriptive inputs with adjectives to describe the sound, such as 'high quality' or 'clear'. It's also better to make the prompt context specific, like 'water stream in a forest' instead of just 'stream', and to use general terms like 'cat' or 'dog' instead of specific names or abstract objects the model may not be familiar with."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase for AudioLDM be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for AudioLDM can be found at haoheliu/AudioLDM on GitHub."
