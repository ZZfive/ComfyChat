        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'cg-noise' custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'cg-noise' custom node in ComfyUI replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two methods used by 'cg-noise' to generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "The 'cg-noise' node generates variations in images by using a weight 'x' and two seeds. It generates the noise based on 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)'."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the provided code snippet?",
        "answer": "The provided code snippet is part of a document that walks through how to evaluate three different diffusion pipelines using CLIP score, CLIP directional similarity, and FID."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIP score in the evaluation of diffusion models?",
        "answer": "The CLIP score measures the compatibility of image-caption pairs, with a higher CLIP score implying higher compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CLIP directional similarity measure?",
        "answer": "The CLIP directional similarity measures the consistency of the change between two images in CLIP space with the change between two image captions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) used for in the evaluation of diffusion models?",
        "answer": "The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is used to measure how similar two datasets of images are. It is often used to evaluate the quality of samples of Generative Adversarial Networks."
