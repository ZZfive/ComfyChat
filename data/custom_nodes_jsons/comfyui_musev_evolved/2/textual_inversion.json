        "question": "What is Textual Inversion in ComfyUI-MuseV Evolved?",
        "answer": "Textual Inversion is a training method in ComfyUI-MuseV Evolved for personalizing models by learning new text embeddings from a few example images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the size of the file produced from Textual Inversion training?",
        "answer": "The file produced from Textual Inversion training is extremely small, only a few KBs in size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the new embeddings learned through Textual Inversion be used?",
        "answer": "The new embeddings learned through Textual Inversion can be loaded into the text encoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `TextualInversionLoaderMixin` provide?",
        "answer": "`TextualInversionLoaderMixin` provides a function for loading Textual Inversion embeddings from MuseVdiffusers and Automatic1111 into the text encoder and loading a special token to activate the embeddings."
