    {
        "question": "What is the core of the technical approach in the Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis paper?",
        "answer": "The core of the technical approach in the paper lies in a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by iteratively denoising trajectories."

    {
        "question": "How can classifier-guided sampling and image inpainting be used in the Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis approach?",
        "answer": "Classifier-guided sampling and image inpainting can be reinterpreted as coherent planning strategies in the Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis approach."
