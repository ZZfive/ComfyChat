        "question": "What is the purpose of Pix2Pix Instruct?",
        "answer": "Pix2Pix Instruct is used to edit input images based on textual prompts in order to generate modified images that fulfill the described requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main difference between Instruct Pix2Pix and Pix2Pix Zero?",
        "answer": "Instruct Pix2Pix is pre-trained for fine-tuning on specific editing instructions, while Pix2Pix Zero is purely inference-based and does not require fine-tuning."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Attend and Excite work?",
        "answer": "Attend and Excite enhances the presence of specific objects in the generated image by limiting the attention to tokens that correspond to those objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of control does Self-attention Guidance provide?",
        "answer": "Self-attention Guidance improves the overall quality of the generated image by conditioning the generation process on the attend dynamics of self-attention in the UNet architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of Depth2Image?",
        "answer": "Depth2Image aims to better preserve the semantics in text-driven image changes by conditioning the generation process on the estimated depth maps from the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the concept of MultiDiffusion Panorama?",
        "answer": "MultiDiffusion Panorama generates high-quality images in various aspect ratios by using a control signal provided by the user, such as a panorama aspect, along with mask controls."

    {
        "question": "How does DreamBooth enable customization?",
        "answer": "DreamBooth fine-tunes a model to generate images in a specific style based on a set of input images, allowing for the creation of novel images in that style."
