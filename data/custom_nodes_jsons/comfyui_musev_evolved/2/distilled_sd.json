        "question": "What is the purpose of using a distilled version of the Stable Diffusion model?",
        "answer": "The distilled version of the Stable Diffusion model reduces the computational burden by eliminating some of the residual and attention blocks from the UNet. This reduces the model size by 51% and improves latency on CPU/GPU by 43%."
    },
    {
        "question": "How much faster is the inference time of the distilled Stable Diffusion model compared to the original model?",
        "answer": "The inference time of the distilled Stable Diffusion model is 29884.2 ms, which is faster than the original model's inference time of 45781.5 ms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of using a tiny distilled version of the Stable Diffusion VAE?",
        "answer": "The tiny distilled version of the Stable Diffusion VAE is used to speed up inference even more by denoising the latents into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How much faster is the inference time when using both the distilled Stable Diffusion model and the tiny AutoEncoder compared to just the distilled model?",
        "answer": "The inference time when using both the distilled Stable Diffusion model and the tiny AutoEncoder is 27165.7 ms, which is faster than just the distilled model's inference time of 29884.2 ms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the images generated by the original Stable Diffusion model and the distilled version?",
        "answer": "The images generated by the original Stable Diffusion model and the distilled version may have slight variations in quality and details, but the overall content and composition remain similar."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many residual and attention blocks are eliminated from the UNet in the distilled Stable Diffusion model?",
        "answer": "Some of the residual and attention blocks are eliminated from the UNet in the distilled Stable Diffusion model, but the exact number is not specified in the given text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the AutoencoderTiny class in the code example?",
        "answer": "The AutoencoderTiny class is used to load the tiny distilled version of the Stable Diffusion VAE, which is used to denoise the latents into images and speed up inference."
