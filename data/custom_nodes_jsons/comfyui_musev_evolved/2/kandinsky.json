        "question": "What is Kandinsky 2.1?",
        "answer": "Kandinsky 2.1 is a model that inherits best practices from Dall-E 2 and Latent diffusion, while introducing some new ideas. It uses CLIP model as text and image encoder and diffusion image prior (mapping) between latent spaces of CLIP modalities to increase visual performance and enable new possibilities in blending images and text-guided image manipulation."
