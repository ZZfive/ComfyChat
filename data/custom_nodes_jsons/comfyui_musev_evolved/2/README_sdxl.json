    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the --validation_prompt, --validation_epochs, and --report_to command line arguments?",
        "answer": "The --validation_prompt, --validation_epochs, and --report_to command line arguments are used for intermediate quality validation between training epochs and logging the results to Weights and Biases."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the --pretrained_vae_model_name_or_path command line argument?",
        "answer": "The --pretrained_vae_model_name_or_path command line argument allows you to specify the location of a better VAE, as SDXL's VAE is known to suffer from numerical instability issues."
