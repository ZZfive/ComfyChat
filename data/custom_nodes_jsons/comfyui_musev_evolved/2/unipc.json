        "question": "What is UniPCMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "UniPCMultistepScheduler is a training-free framework designed for fast sampling of diffusion models, introduced in the paper 'UniPC: A Unified Predictor-Corrector Framework for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models' by Wenliang Zhao, Lujia Bai, Yongming Rao, Jie Zhou, and Jiwen Lu."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does UniPC consist of?",
        "answer": "UniPC consists of a corrector (UniC) and a predictor (UniP) that share a unified analytical form and support arbitrary orders."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is UniPC model-agnostic?",
        "answer": "Yes, UniPC is by design model-agnostic, supporting pixel-space/latent-space DPMs on unconditional/conditional sampling. It can also be applied to both noise prediction and data prediction models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended solver order for guide sampling and unconditional sampling?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to set `solver_order` to 2 for guide sampling, and `solver_order=3` for unconditional sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does UniPCMultistepScheduler support dynamic thresholding?",
        "answer": "Yes, dynamic thresholding from Imagen is supported, and for pixel-space diffusion models, you can set both `predict_x0=True` and `thresholding=True` to use dynamic thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is dynamic thresholding suitable for latent-space diffusion models?",
        "answer": "No, this thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main components of the UniPCMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "The main components of the UniPCMultistepScheduler are the UniC corrector and the UniP predictor, which share a unified analytical form and support arbitrary orders."
