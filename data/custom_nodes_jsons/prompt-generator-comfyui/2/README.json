    {
        "question": "How can users access pretrained prompt models for prompt-generator-comfyui?",
        "answer": "Users can access pretrained prompt models for prompt-generator-comfyui by downloading the models from the provided link and placing them in the 'models/prompt_generators' folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available quantization options in prompt-generator-comfyui?",
        "answer": "The available quantization options in prompt-generator-comfyui depend on the user's environment. If Quanto requirements are met, users can choose between 'none', 'int8', 'float8', and 'int4' values. If Bitsandbytes requirements are met, users can choose between 'none', 'int8', and 'int4' values."

    {
        "question": "How does the 'lock' variable function in prompt-generator-comfyui?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'lock' variable in prompt-generator-comfyui skips the generation process and allows users to choose from the last generated prompts using the 'index' value or 'random_index'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three preprocessing modes available in prompt-generator-comfyui?",
        "answer": "The three preprocessing modes available in prompt-generator-comfyui are 'exact_keyword', which checks for the pure keyword without parentheses and weights; 'exact_prompt', which allows prompts with parentheses but not repeated prompts; and 'none', which allows all prompts, including repeated ones."
