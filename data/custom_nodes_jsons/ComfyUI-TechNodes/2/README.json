        "question": "What are ComfyUI nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI nodes are components designed to extend the functionality of the ComfyUI software, typically for merging, testing, and other advanced processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SDNext Merge do?",
        "answer": "SDNext Merge is a node in ComfyUI that merges images from the SD.Next system, with the Re-Basin functionality built-in to ensure the merged image quality remains high."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key uses of ComfyUI nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI nodes are generally used for merging, testing, and enhancing the image generation capabilities of the ComfyUI system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the U-Net block adjusted in MBW Layers?",
        "answer": "MBW Layers adjust the alpha of each U-Net block individually, allowing for precise control over the blending of layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of Quantization?",
        "answer": "Quantization is a ComfyUI node that reduces the precision of the neural network model it is applied to, effectively compressing the size of the model without significantly impacting performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Repeat VAE work?",
        "answer": "Repeat VAE is a node that encodes and decodes an image using a VAE multiple times, which can be useful for testing and comparing different VAE architectures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the sources of code used to create ComfyUI nodes?",
        "answer": "The nodes were created using code from SD.Next, meh, ComfyUI, and VAE-BlessUp."
