        "question": "What is the purpose of the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI is designed to analyze and sort images based on head orientation. It uses MediaPipe library to detect facial landmarks and calculate head pose."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who developed the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI was developed by PabloGFX."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main features of the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main features of the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI include detecting facial landmarks using MediaPipe, calculating head orientation, sorting input images based on similarity to reference images' head orientations, and supporting batch processing of multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the requirements for using the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The requirements for using the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI include numpy>=1.19.3, opencv-python>=4.5.5.64, mediapipe>=0.8.9.1, Pillow>=8.3.1, and torch>=1.9.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI sort input images?",
        "answer": "The Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI sorts input images by analyzing both input and reference images using MediaPipe's face mesh detection, calculating the head orientation for each detected face, and then matching the input images' orientations to the reference images' orientations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if there are fewer input images than reference images in the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "If there are fewer input images than reference images in the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI, the last input image is repeated to match the count of reference images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what license is the Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI distributed?",
        "answer": "The Head Orientation Node for ComfyUI is distributed under the Apache License 2.0."
