        "answer": "The supported vocoder models include Melgan, MultiBand-Melgan, ParallelWaveGAN, and GAN-TTS (Discriminator Only)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can different vocoder models be adapted for training?",
        "answer": "Mozilla TTS provides a flexible and modular framework that allows for the easy adaptation of different vocoder models for training."

    {
        "question": "What are the steps to train a new vocoder model?",
        "answer": "To train a new vocoder model, all wav files need to be gathered into a folder and given to the `data_path` in `config.json`. Parameters need to be defined in `config.json`, and then training can be started using the command `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python tts/bin/train_vocoder.py --config_path path/to/config.json`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a previous training run be continued?",
        "answer": "A previous training run can be continued by using the command `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python tts/bin/train_vocoder.py --continue_path path/to/your/model/folder`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the process for fine-tuning a pre-trained model?",
        "answer": "To fine-tune a pre-trained model, use the command `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python tts/bin/train_vocoder.py --restore_path path/to/your/model.pth`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of using a modular framework for vocoder training?",
        "answer": "The modular framework allows for easy adaptation of different vocoder models, which can enhance the versatility and efficiency of training."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the command `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python tts/bin/train_vocoder.py --config_path path/to/config.json`?",
        "answer": "This command is used to start the training of a vocoder model using the configurations specified in `config.json`. The `data_path` parameter should be set to the directory containing the wav files for training."
