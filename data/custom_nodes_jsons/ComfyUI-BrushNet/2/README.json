        "question": "What is ComfyUI-BrushNet?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-BrushNet is a custom node for ComfyUI that implements BrushNet, a plug-and-play image inpainting model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three main custom nodes implemented in ComfyUI-BrushNet?",
        "answer": "The three main custom nodes implemented in ComfyUI-BrushNet are Brushnet, PowerPaint, and HiDiffusion."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Brushnet Loader parameter 'dtype'?",
        "answer": "The 'dtype' parameter in Brushnet Loader specifies the torch.dtype of BrushNet. The default value is torch.float16."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'scale' parameter in the Brushnet node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter in the Brushnet node determines the strength of BrushNet. The outputs of BrushNet are multiplied by 'scale' before they are added to the residual in the original unet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be placed in the 'models/inpaint' folder for PowerPaint?",
        "answer": "For PowerPaint, both 'diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors' and 'pytorch_model.bin' should be placed in the 'models/inpaint' folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'fitting' parameter in the PowerPaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'fitting' parameter in the PowerPaint node determines the PowerPaint fitting degree."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is one of the limitations of BrushNet mentioned in the documentation?",
        "answer": "One limitation of BrushNet is that the quality and content generated by the model heavily depend on the chosen base model. Results can exhibit incoherence if the given image and base model are not well-aligned."
