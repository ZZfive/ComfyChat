        "question": "What is the purpose of Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings?",
        "answer": "Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings provides the ability to set the temperature for both UNET and CLIP in ComfyUI, allowing for preservation of quality during downscaling or upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you use Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You can use Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings like any other model patch in ComfyUI, by adjusting the temperature settings for UNET and CLIP."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of adjusting the CLIP temperature setting in Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the CLIP temperature setting in Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings can produce variations in the generated image. For example, at CLIP temperature 0.75, 1, and 1.25, the prompt 'a bio-organic living plant spaceship' generates different image results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the temperature scaling option in Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings improve image upscaling?",
        "answer": "The temperature scaling option in Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings helps avoid smudged details during an upscale, improving the quality of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the temperature scaling option work with tiled upscales in Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings?",
        "answer": "No, the temperature scaling option does not work with tiled upscales as the tiling uses smaller latents as the workaround for a known issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings perform on SDXL models?",
        "answer": "Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings can improve the quality of images generated by SDXL models at various resolutions, such as 512x512, 256x256, and 128x128, by modifying the U-Net settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings be used with SD v1-5-pruned-emaonly models?",
        "answer": "Yes, Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings can be used with SD v1-5-pruned-emaonly models to fix scaling issues with the U-Net, as demonstrated in the proof of concept tests."
