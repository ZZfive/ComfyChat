Then, download the MS COCO train dataset (downscaled to 256x256) and place it in the 'dataset' folder. After that, load the 'TrainFastStyleTransfer' node in ComfyUI and adjust the parameters such as content_weight, style_weight, tv_weight, and batch_size. It's also recommended to start training with a pretrained model to reduce training time. Save the model and generate test pictures at regular intervals."
