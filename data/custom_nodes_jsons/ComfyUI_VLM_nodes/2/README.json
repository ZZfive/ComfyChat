        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_VLM_nodes is a set of custom nodes that integrate Vision Language Models (VLMs) into ComfyUI, allowing users to load and use any VLM with LLaVa models in GGUF format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the requirements for using ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "To use ComfyUI_VLM_nodes, you need to have Python version 3.9 or higher installed, and download the necessary model files and their corresponding clip projectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Structured Output node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "The Structured Output node in VLM Nodes allows users to obtain reliable structured outputs from the model, such as extracting entities, numbers, classifying prompts with given classes, and generating specific prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image to Music node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes work?",
        "answer": "The Image to Music node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes utilizes VLMs, LLMs, and AudioLDM-2 to generate music from images. The generated music can be saved using the SaveAudioNode inside the output folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the InternLM-XComposer2-VL Node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "The InternLM-XComposer2-VL Node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes integrates the InternLM-XComposer2-VL Model using AutoGPTQ. It is one of the best models for visual perception but is also resource-heavy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Automatic Prompt Generation and Suggestion Nodes in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "The Automatic Prompt Generation and Suggestion Nodes in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes include the Get Keyword node, LLava PromptGenerator node, and Suggester node. These nodes help in creating prompts, extracting keywords, and generating different prompts based on the original prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the JoyTag Node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes?",
        "answer": "The JoyTag Node in ComfyUI_VLM_nodes is an AI vision model developed by @fpgamine for tagging images, focusing on sex positivity and inclusivity. It uses the Danbooru tagging schema and works across a wide range of images."
