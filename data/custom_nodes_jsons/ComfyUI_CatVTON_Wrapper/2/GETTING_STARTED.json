        "question": "How can you launch end-to-end DensePose-RCNN training with ResNet-50 FPN backbone on 8 GPUs following the s1x schedule?",
        "answer": "To launch end-to-end DensePose-RCNN training with ResNet-50 FPN backbone on 8 GPUs following the s1x schedule, you can run the command: python train_net.py --config-file configs/densepose_rcnn_R_50_FPN_s1x.yaml --num-gpus 8"
    },
    {
        "question": "What modifications are needed to train on 1 GPU instead of 8 GPUs?",
        "answer": "To train on 1 GPU, you can apply the linear learning rate scaling rule by adding SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH 2 SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.0025 to the command."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you perform model testing in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "Model testing can be done in the same way as training, except for an additional flag --eval-only and model location specification through MODEL.WEIGHTS model.pth in the command line."
