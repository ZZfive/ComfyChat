    {
        "question": "How can users create their own optimizer and write training logic in Detectron2?",
        "answer": "Users are free to create their own optimizer and write the training logic using PyTorch, which allows researchers to see the entire training logic more clearly and have full control. An example is provided in tools/plain_train_net.py."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of Detectron2's 'trainer' abstraction?",
        "answer": "The 'trainer' abstraction in Detectron2 simplifies standard types of training by providing a minimal hook system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SimpleTrainer().train() provide?",
        "answer": "SimpleTrainer().train() provides minimal abstraction for single-cost single-optimizer single-data-source training."

    {
        "question": "What default behaviors does DefaultTrainer().train() include?",
        "answer": "DefaultTrainer().train() includes default configurations for learning rate schedule, logging, evaluation, checkpointing, etc."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users customize the training loops in Detectron2?",
        "answer": "Users can customize the training loops by either changing the behavior of DefaultTrainer through subclassing or starting from tools/plain_train_net.py to implement novel functionalities."
