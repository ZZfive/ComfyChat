        "question": "What is the purpose of the evaluation process in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, the evaluation process takes a number of inputs/outputs pairs and aggregates them."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you perform evaluation in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, you can perform evaluation by using the model directly and parsing its inputs/outputs manually or by using the DatasetEvaluator interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the DatasetEvaluator interface in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, the DatasetEvaluator interface is an implementation of evaluation that computes metrics using standard dataset-specific APIs like COCO, LVIS, etc."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you implement a custom DatasetEvaluator in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, you can implement a custom DatasetEvaluator by defining a class with methods like reset(), process(inputs, outputs), and evaluate() to perform specific tasks using the inputs/outputs pairs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of using the inference_on_dataset function in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, the benefit of using the inference_on_dataset function is that you can merge evaluators together using DatasetEvaluators, allowing you to run all evaluations without having to go through the dataset multiple times."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inference_on_dataset function provide in ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI_CatVTON_Wrapper, the inference_on_dataset function provides accurate speed benchmarks for the given model and dataset."
