        "question": "What is the purpose of the FooocusPromptExpansion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FooocusPromptExpansion node in ComfyUI is designed to expand and generate new text based on input text and a seed value. The seed value introduces randomness to enhance the diversity and creativity of the generated content while maintaining a degree of controllability through the seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FooocusPromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FooocusPromptExpansion node is 'text', which serves as the source material for the text expansion process. It is crucial as it provides context and foundation for generating new content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the FooocusPromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the FooocusPromptExpansion node is 'seed', which introduces randomness into the text expansion process, allowing for the generation of diverse outputs from the same input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FooocusPromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FooocusPromptExpansion node is 'result', which contains the expanded text and is the output of the node's text expansion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the FooocusPromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for running the FooocusPromptExpansion node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale_seed' static method in the FooocusPromptExpansion class do?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_seed' static method in the FooocusPromptExpansion class scales the seed value by taking the modulo of the seed with (2^32 - 1)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information is logged by the FooocusPromptExpansion node during its execution?",
        "answer": "During its execution, the FooocusPromptExpansion node logs information about the seed value used, the original text, and the expanded text result."
