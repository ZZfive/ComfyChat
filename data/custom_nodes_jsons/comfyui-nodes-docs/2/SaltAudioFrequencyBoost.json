        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node is designed to enhance audio experience by selectively boosting the frequency of the audio signal. It allows precise adjustments to the audio's frequency spectrum, enabling enhancement of specific frequency bands to achieve desired audio characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three main input types required for the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node?",
        "answer": "The three main input types required for the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node are 'audio', 'frequency', and 'bandwidth'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'audio' input type represent?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' input type represents the original, unprocessed audio data. It is essential for defining the audio content on which the frequency enhancement will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'frequency' input type used for?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' input type is used to specify the center frequency that needs to be boosted. It allows for targeted enhancement within the audio spectrum to impact the desired frequency bands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gain_dB' input type control?",
        "answer": "The 'gain_dB' input type controls the intensity of the frequency boost applied to the specified frequency band. It is expressed in decibels (dB), allowing users to adjust the frequency enhancement strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bandwidth' input type define?",
        "answer": "The 'bandwidth' input type defines the spread or width of the frequency band around the center frequency that will be boosted. It determines the range of frequencies affected by the frequency enhancement operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node provides a single output type, 'audio', which represents the audio data after the frequency enhancement has been applied."
