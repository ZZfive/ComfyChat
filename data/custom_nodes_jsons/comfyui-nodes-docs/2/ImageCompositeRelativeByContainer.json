        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node is used to create composite images by positioning and merging two sets of images relative to the container size. It dynamically calculates the placement of images based on the container's dimensions, ensuring that the images are appropriately scaled and positioned before merging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node are: container (reference container image), images_a (first set of images to be composited), images_b (second set of images to be composited), images_a_x (relative horizontal position of the first set of images), images_a_y (relative vertical position of the first set of images), images_b_x (relative horizontal position of the second set of images), images_b_y (relative vertical position of the second set of images), background (specifies which set of images should be used as the background for the final composite image), and method (specifies the method used for compositing the images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'background' parameter in the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'background' parameter in the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node specifies which set of images ('images_a' or 'images_b') should be used as the background for the final composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node is 'image', which represents the final composite image resulting from merging and positioning the two sets of images based on the container size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node is 'image/composite'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the container is smaller than the maximum width or height of the images in the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node?",
        "answer": "If the container is smaller than the maximum width or height of the images, the ImageCompositeRelativeByContainer node will raise a ValueError stating that the container cannot be smaller than the maximum width or height of the images."
