    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'pipe' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter is crucial in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node as it represents the pipeline containing the settings to be extracted. It is a required input that plays a key role in the node's operation by providing the context of the loader settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'names' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node do?",
        "answer": "The 'names' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node is optional and can be used to provide additional context or default values for the loader settings. It does not directly affect the execution of the node but may influence how the results are presented or interpreted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'unique_id' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node is used to identify specific nodes within the workflow. It is optional, and when provided, it can help the node more accurately locate and update the settings of specific nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node is an optional input that can contain additional information about the workflow. It is particularly useful when detailed workflow information is needed for the node to effectively perform its function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'ckpt_name' output provide in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' output in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node provides the name of the checkpoint used in the pipeline, which is key information for users to understand the model configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae_name' output represent in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae_name' output in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node represents the name of the VAE component used in the pipeline, providing users with insight into the generative model being used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'lora_name' output in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' output in the 'showLoaderSettingsNames' node displays the name of the LoRA model, which is important for users to understand the fine-tuning capabilities applied to the base model."
