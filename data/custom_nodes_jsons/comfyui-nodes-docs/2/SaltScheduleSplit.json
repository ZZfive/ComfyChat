        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleSplit node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSplit node is designed to split a given list of schedules into two parts based on a specified index, which is crucial for dividing schedules into manageable sections for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltScheduleSplit node are 'schedule_list' (Comfy dtype: LIST, Python dtype: List[Any]) and 'split_index' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'split_index' parameter in the SaltScheduleSplit node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'split_index' parameter in the SaltScheduleSplit node determines the point at which the schedule list is split, affecting how the list is segmented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SaltScheduleSplit node are 'schedule_list_a' (Comfy dtype: LIST, Python dtype: List[Any]) and 'schedule_list_b' (Comfy dtype: LIST, Python dtype: List[Any])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'schedule_list_a' represent in the output of the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "In the output of the SaltScheduleSplit node, 'schedule_list_a' represents the first part of the schedule list, containing items before the split index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'schedule_list_b' represent in the output of the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "In the output of the SaltScheduleSplit node, 'schedule_list_b' represents the second part of the schedule list, containing items from the split index onwards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltScheduleSplit node is 'CPU'."
