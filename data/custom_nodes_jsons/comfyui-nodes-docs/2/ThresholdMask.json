        "question": "What is the main function of the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The main function of the ThresholdMask node is to transform an image into a binary mask based on a specified threshold value, which is crucial for image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the parameters required for the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The required parameters are 'mask' and 'value'. 'mask' is the input image that needs threshold processing, and 'value' is the threshold that determines pixel inclusion in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the ThresholdMask node generated?",
        "answer": "The output is an image binary mask where pixels are classified as either belonging to the object (above the threshold) or not (below the threshold)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I use ThresholdMask for a custom workflow outside of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "It's not stated in the doc, but because ThresholdMask works on PyTorch tensors using ComfyUI's specific functions, it's designed to work within the ComfyUI framework and may not be directly portable outside of it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the default input types supported by the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The default input type is an image tensor of type 'MFKueue (COMFY朋友圈 (COMFY娟日style (COMFY.print (/images/square))) [24, 22, 224])'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the categories that the ThresholdMask node belongs to?",
        "answer": "ThresholdMask belongs to the 'mask' category, indicating its purpose is for masking or isolating specific areas within images."
