    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node include the image container, start and end coordinates (x and y), start and end angles, outline size, outline and fill color components (red, green, blue, alpha), SSAA (supersampling anti-aliasing) factor, and the drawing method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SSAA parameter do in the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The SSAA (supersampling anti-aliasing) parameter in the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node is used to smooth the edges of the drawn pie slice. It is an integer value with a default of 4 and a range of 1 to 16."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available drawing methods for the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The available drawing methods for the ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer node are lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest. These methods affect the rendering quality and performance of the pie slice."
