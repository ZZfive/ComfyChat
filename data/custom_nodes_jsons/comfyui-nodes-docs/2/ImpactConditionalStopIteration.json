        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node in ComfyUI is designed to control the execution flow based on a condition check. When called with a true condition, it sends a signal to stop the iteration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cond' parameter in the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond' parameter is a boolean value that determines whether the iteration should be stopped or not. It is crucial to the operation of the node as it directly influences the decision process regarding the continuation or termination of the iteration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'doit' method in the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method does not return any output. It is a method without a return value, whose sole purpose is to send a 'stop-iteration' signal when the condition is true, thus affecting the control flow of the program."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node belongs to the ImpactPack/Logic category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node is an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the 'doit' method in the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node return a value?",
        "answer": "No, the 'doit' method in the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node does not return a value. Its sole purpose is to send a 'stop-iteration' signal when the condition is true."
