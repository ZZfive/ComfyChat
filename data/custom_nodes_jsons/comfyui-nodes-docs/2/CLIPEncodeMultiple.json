        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPEncodeMultiple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPEncodeMultiple node is designed to encode multiple inputs using the CLIP model to generate a series of conditions based on those inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node are 'clip' (the CLIP model used for encoding inputs) and 'inputs_len' (the number of inputs to be encoded)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' input represent in the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' input represents the CLIP model that is used to encode the inputs. It is crucial for determining how the inputs are processed and encoded into conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' input specify in the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' input specifies the number of inputs to be encoded. It affects the number of iterations and, consequently, the size of the output conditioning list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPEncodeMultiple node is 'conditioning', which is a list of conditions generated from the inputs. Each element in the list corresponds to the condition of a single input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CLIPEncodeMultiple node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the CLIPEncodeMultiple node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node is 'GPU'."
