        "question": "What is the purpose of the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class is used to preprocess depth maps for segmentation tasks using the LeReS algorithm, which optimizes the input data to improve the quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rm_nearest' parameter do in the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'rm_nearest' parameter adjusts the threshold for removing nearby pixels, which is crucial for defining the accuracy of the depth map and the clarity of the segmentation boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'rm_background' parameter affect the segmentation process in the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'rm_background' parameter sets the threshold for removing background noise, which is important for isolating the subject and ensuring the accuracy of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'boost' parameter in the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "When the 'boost' parameter is enabled, it enhances the features of the depth map, which may improve the segmentation results but may also increase processing time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is SEGS_PREPROCESSOR, which represents the preprocessed depth map optimized for segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the LeReS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
