        "question": "What is the purpose of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImageBatchByIndexes node is designed to insert specific images into a given batch of images at specified index positions while maintaining the original sequence order of the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node are 'images', 'images_to_insert', and 'insert_indexes'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' input represent in the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input represents the original batch of images into which new images will be inserted. It serves as the basis for the insertion operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images_to_insert' input represent in the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The 'images_to_insert' input represents the images that will be inserted into the original batch at specified index positions. This parameter is crucial for defining which images are added and where they are added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'insert_indexes' input represent in the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The 'insert_indexes' input represents the index positions in the original batch where the new images should be inserted. This parameter determines the insertion locations, aligning the new images with the original sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node is 'images_after_insert', which represents the updated batch of images after the insertion operation, preserving the original sequence order and integrating the new images at specified positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node is 'GPU'."
