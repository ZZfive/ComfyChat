        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSegmentationCustom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentationCustom node in ComfyUI is used for custom image segmentation tasks. It accurately depicts and separates different elements in an image using advanced configurations and models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageSegmentationCustom node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageSegmentationCustom node are: images, model, alpha_matting, alpha_matting_foreground_threshold, alpha_matting_background_threshold, alpha_matting_erode_size, post_process_mask, mean, std, and size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'alpha_matting' parameter affect the image segmentation process in the ImageSegmentationCustom node?",
        "answer": "The 'alpha_matting' parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether to apply alpha matting to improve the edge quality of the segmentation. It helps achieve more accurate and refined edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mean' and 'std' parameters in the ImageSegmentationCustom node?",
        "answer": "The 'mean' parameter is used to normalize the input images by adjusting the color attributes, which plays a key role in preparing the image for segmentation. The 'std' parameter represents the standard deviation value for image normalization and is crucial for adjusting the scale of pixel values to match the expected input distribution of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the output of the ImageSegmentationCustom node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter specifies the target size to which the images will be resized before segmentation. It affects the resolution and level of detail in the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageSegmentationCustom node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageSegmentationCustom node is an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: List[Image]). It represents the segmented image where different elements within each image are accurately depicted and separated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ImageSegmentationCustom node require a GPU for processing?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImageSegmentationCustom node requires a GPU for processing, as indicated by the 'Infra type: GPU' in the usage tips."
