        "question": "What is the purpose of the AV_LLMChat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AV_LLMChat node in ComfyUI utilizes language model APIs to generate dialogue. It processes a series of messages, configuration parameters, and an optional seed to produce a coherent and contextually relevant response."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AV_LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the AV_LLMChat node are: messages (a list of messages representing the conversation history), api (an API object for communicating with a specific language model service), config (configuration settings for the language model), and seed (an optional seed for deterministic output generation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'messages' input in the AV_LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The 'messages' input in the AV_LLMChat node is a list of messages that represent the conversation history. Each message has a role indicating its source (system, user, or assistant), can contain text, and may optionally include an image. This input is crucial for maintaining context and generating relevant responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'api' input in the AV_LLMChat node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'api' input in the AV_LLMChat node specifies the API object used to communicate with a specific language model service, such as OpenAI or Claude. This parameter determines the underlying model and API settings for generating responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'config' input in the AV_LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The 'config' input in the AV_LLMChat node specifies the configuration settings for the language model, including the model type, maximum number of tokens, and temperature. These settings are used to fine-tune the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional 'seed' input used for in the AV_LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'seed' input in the AV_LLMChat node is used for deterministic output generation, ensuring the reproducibility of responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AV_LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AV_LLMChat node is a string, representing the text response generated by the language model based on the input messages and configuration."
