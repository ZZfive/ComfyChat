        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node is designed to extract the characteristic wavelength from a sinusoidal curve, which plays a key role in analyzing and understanding the periodic nature of the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'curve' parameter in the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it represents the sinusoidal curve from which the wavelength will be derived. It is a required input that directly affects the output of the node, determining the accuracy and relevance of the obtained wavelength value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'wavelength' output parameter represent in the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The 'wavelength' output parameter represents the length of one complete cycle of the sinusoidal curve, which is a critical piece of information that can be used for further analysis or making informed decisions in the context of the application where the node is being used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node uses CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The category of the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node is ROOT_CATEGORY."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node's main function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the KfSinusoidalGetWavelength node's main function is FLOAT."
