        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurvesAddx10 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesAddx10 node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple input curves by adding their values together to enhance the overall representation of the data. It serves as a tool for simplifying the analysis and visualization of keyframed curves through summation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the KfCurvesAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the KfCurvesAddx10 node is 'curve_0', which is essential as it sets the baseline for the subsequent addition of other curves. Its presence is mandatory and directly affects the result of the node operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the KfCurvesAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the KfCurvesAddx10 node are 'curve_1' to 'curve_9'. These additional curve inputs play a crucial role in the aggregation process, influencing the final sum and the effectiveness of the node in integrating data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurvesAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfCurvesAddx10 node is 'curve_out', which represents the sum of all input curves and provides a comprehensive and integrated view of the aggregated data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfCurvesAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfCurvesAddx10 node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfCurvesAddx10 node calculate the output curve?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesAddx10 node calculates the output curve by adding together the values of all input curves from 'curve_0' to 'curve_9'. The output represents the sum of these curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the KfCurvesAddx10 node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the KfCurvesAddx10 node defines the class, category, function, return types, input types, and the main method that performs the addition of the input curves to produce the output curve."
