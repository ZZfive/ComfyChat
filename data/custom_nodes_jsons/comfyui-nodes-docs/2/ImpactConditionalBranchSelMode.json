        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node acts as a conditional switch in workflows. It evaluates the 'cond' input to decide whether to return 'tt_value' (true value) or 'ff_value' (false value), thus guiding the execution flow based on the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cond' input parameter in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node do?",
        "answer": "The 'cond' parameter is a boolean value that determines the execution path of the node. It is crucial as it directly influences whether 'tt_value' or 'ff_value' is returned, thereby affecting downstream operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sel_mode' parameter in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node?",
        "answer": "The 'sel_mode' parameter indicates whether the node should make a selection based on the prompt or execution. It is important because it can change the behavior of the node without altering the condition, providing flexibility in the decision-making process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'tt_value' parameter in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node?",
        "answer": "The 'tt_value' is the value returned when the condition is true. Its importance lies in defining the outcome of the node for affirmative cases, which is critical for subsequent steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ff_value' parameter in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node?",
        "answer": "The 'ff_value' is the value returned when the condition is false. It is important because it sets the output of the node for negative cases, which may be crucial for the continuity and logic of the subsequent workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output represents the outcome of the conditional execution. If the condition is true, it is 'tt_value'; if the condition is false, it is 'ff_value'. It provides essential data for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
