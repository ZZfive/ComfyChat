        "question": "What is the purpose of the ClipVisionOutputClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ClipVisionOutputClamp node is designed to pass CLIP vision output data as-is, serving as a practical tool to ensure data consistency and integrity in the processing pipeline of CLIP vision output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ClipVisionOutputClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ClipVisionOutputClamp node is 'clip_vision_output', which represents the CLIP vision output data to be processed through the node. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data as it moves through the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the 'clip_vision_output' input parameter?",
