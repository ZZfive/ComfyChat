        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node integrates advanced sampling techniques into the animation diffusion process, utilizing evolutionary model sampling configurations to enhance the quality and efficiency of generated animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node are 'model' (specifying the model used for the animation diffusion process) and 'beta_schedule' (determining the beta schedule applied during the sampling process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'beta_schedule' input determine in the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node?",
        "answer": "The 'beta_schedule' input determines the beta schedule applied during the sampling process, influencing the smoothness and quality of the animation transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node are 'm_models' (providing additional models for the animation process), 'context_options' (defining context-specific options to modify the sampling behavior), and 'sample_settings' (specifying settings related to the sampling process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node is 'model', which represents an enhanced model instance equipped with evolved sampling configurations to improve the animation diffusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node handle the 'm_models' input?",
        "answer": "If 'm_models' is provided, the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node clones the motion models, validates their compatibility with the SD model, creates injection parameters, and applies context options if specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'sample_settings' input is not provided in the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node?",
        "answer": "If the 'sample_settings' input is not provided, the ADE_UseEvolvedSampling node uses the default SampleSettings()."
