        "question": "What is the purpose of the FeatherMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FeatherMask node in ComfyUI is designed to smoothly blend the edges of a given mask with its surrounding area."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FeatherMask node create a soft transition at the mask's boundaries?",
        "answer": "The FeatherMask node creates a soft transition at the mask's boundaries by gradually adjusting the opacity of the mask's pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'mask' parameter in the FeatherMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is a binary tensor that defines the region of interest in the image. It is crucial for the node as it determines which parts of the image will be feathered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'left' parameter in the FeatherMask node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'left' parameter in the FeatherMask node specifies the number of pixels from the left edge of the mask where the feathering effect will start."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'top' parameter affect the output of the FeatherMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'top' parameter affects the output of the FeatherMask node by controlling the height of the feathering area at the top of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'right' parameter play in the FeatherMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'right' parameter in the FeatherMask node sets the number of pixels from the right edge of the mask where the feathering will begin, thus establishing the width of the feathering area on the right side of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bottom' parameter in the FeatherMask node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'bottom' parameter in the FeatherMask node indicates the number of pixels from the bottom edge of the mask where the feathering will start, which is crucial for determining the height of the feathering area at the bottom of the mask."
