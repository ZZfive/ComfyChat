        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageFilterBoxBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBoxBlur node is used to apply a box blur effect to images in ComfyUI. It achieves a uniform smoothing effect by specifying the size of the blur in the x and y dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageFilterBoxBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageFilterBoxBlur node are: images (the image to be processed), size_x (the horizontal size of the blur), and size_y (the vertical size of the blur)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_x parameter specify in the ImageFilterBoxBlur node?",
        "answer": "The size_x parameter in the ImageFilterBoxBlur node specifies the horizontal size of the blur effect. It determines the width of the kernel used in the box blur operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_y parameter specify in the ImageFilterBoxBlur node?",
        "answer": "The size_y parameter in the ImageFilterBoxBlur node specifies the vertical size of the blur effect. It determines the height of the kernel used in the box blur operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageFilterBoxBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageFilterBoxBlur node is an image that has been processed with the box blur effect, resulting in a uniformly smooth appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageFilterBoxBlur node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageFilterBoxBlur node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageFilterBoxBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBoxBlur node belongs to the 'image/filter' category in ComfyUI."
