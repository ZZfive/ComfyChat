        "question": "What is the purpose of the KuwaharaBlur class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KuwaharaBlur class in ComfyUI is designed to apply the Kuwahara filter to an image, which is a non-linear digital filter used for image processing. It smooths the image while preserving edges, making it especially useful for reducing image noise without blurring important details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KuwaharaBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KuwaharaBlur node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: np.ndarray), blur_radius (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and method (Comfy dtype: COMBO, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blur_radius parameter in the KuwaharaBlur node determine?",
        "answer": "The blur_radius parameter in the KuwaharaBlur node determines the extent of the smoothing effect applied by the Kuwahara filter. It affects the size of the blocks used for processing, which directly influences the balance between noise reduction and detail preservation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two methods available for the method parameter in the KuwaharaBlur node?",
        "answer": "The two methods available for the method parameter in the KuwaharaBlur node are 'mean' and 'gaussian'. The 'mean' method provides more uniform smoothing, while the 'gaussian' method offers more adaptive smoothing based on the local properties of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output_image represent in the KuwaharaBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output_image in the KuwaharaBlur node represents the processed image after applying the Kuwahara filter. It reflects the main functionality of the node, which is the result of noise reduction and edge preservation efforts, providing a clearer and more definitive outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KuwaharaBlur node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KuwaharaBlur node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the blur_radius is set to 0 in the KuwaharaBlur node?",
        "answer": "When the blur_radius is set to 0 in the KuwaharaBlur node, the original image is returned without any processing."
