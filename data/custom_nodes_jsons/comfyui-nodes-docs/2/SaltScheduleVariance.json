        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleVariance node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleVariance node in ComfyUI creates a varied output by applying noise-based jitter and easing functions to a schedule list, enhancing the dynamic range and visual appeal of scheduled events or animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the SaltScheduleVariance node is the schedule_list, which is a list of the main schedule values that need to be varied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'curves_mode' parameter affect the output of the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The 'curves_mode' parameter specifies the type of easing function to be applied to the schedule list, allowing for customization of the variation effects based on specific aesthetic or functional requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_perlin_tremors' parameter control in the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_perlin_tremors' parameter is a boolean flag that determines whether noise-based jitter is applied to the schedule list, introducing a layer of controlled randomness to the variation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'tremor_scale' parameter influence the output of the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The 'tremor_scale' parameter adjusts the intensity of the noise-based jitter applied to the schedule list, allowing for fine-tuning of the variation effect's impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'octaves' parameter in the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The 'octaves' parameter defines the number of noise layers used to create the jitter, affecting the complexity and texture of the variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'persistence' and 'lacunarity' parameters affect the jitter in the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The 'persistence' parameter controls the decrease in amplitude across noise octaves, influencing the smoothness and subtlety of the jitter, while the 'lacunarity' parameter determines the increase in frequency across noise octaves, affecting the detail and scale of the jitter."
