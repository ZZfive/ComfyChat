        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Overlay node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Overlay node in ComfyUI is used to overlay one image onto another image, providing various customization options such as resizing, rotating, adjusting transparency, and optionally applying a mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Overlay node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Overlay node include base_image, overlay_image, overlay_resize, resize_method, rescale_factor, width, height, x_offset, y_offset, rotation, and opacity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'overlay_resize' parameter in the Image Overlay node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'overlay_resize' parameter specifies how the overlay image should be resized to fit the base image, with options including fitting dimensions, scaling by a factor, or resizing to a specific width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'optional_mask' input in the Image Overlay node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_mask' input is an optional mask that can be applied to the overlay image to control the transparency of different parts of the overlay."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Overlay node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Overlay node is the modified base image with the overlay applied, reflecting all specified transformations and adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Overlay node handle resizing of the overlay image?",
        "answer": "The Image Overlay node resizes the overlay image based on the selected sizing option, which can be fitting dimensions, scaling by a rescale factor, or resizing to a specific width and height. The resizing is done using the specified resize method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Image Overlay node use?",
        "answer": "The Image Overlay node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
