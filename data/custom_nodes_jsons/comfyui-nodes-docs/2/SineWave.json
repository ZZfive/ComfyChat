        "question": "What is the purpose of the SineWave class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SineWave class in ComfyUI is used to apply a sine wave distortion effect to images, enhancing their visual appearance by simulating a wave-like pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SineWave class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SineWave class are: image (the main input for the node operation), amplitude (determines the strength of the sine wave effect), frequency (determines the granularity of the distortion), and direction (specifies the direction of the sine wave effect, either horizontal or vertical)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the amplitude parameter control in the SineWave class?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter in the SineWave class controls the strength of the sine wave effect, determining the extent of distortion applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the frequency parameter affect the sine wave distortion in the SineWave class?",
        "answer": "The frequency parameter in the SineWave class determines the number of sine wave cycles per unit of image space, affecting the granularity of the distortion and playing a significant role in defining the appearance of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the direction parameter in the SineWave class?",
        "answer": "The direction parameter in the SineWave class can be either 'horizontal' or 'vertical', specifying the direction in which the sine wave effect is applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SineWave class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SineWave class is an output image, which represents the result of applying the sine wave effect to the input image, containing the creative distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for using the SineWave class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the SineWave class in ComfyUI is GPU."
