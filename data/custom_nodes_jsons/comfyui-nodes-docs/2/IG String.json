        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG String node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG String node in ComfyUI is designed to process string inputs, allowing users to input and pass string values in a node-based processing environment. It serves as a fundamental building block for operations that require text data manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the IG String node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the IG String node is 'value', which accepts a string value as the main input. This allows the node to process and pass through the input string without any modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype and Python dtype does the 'value' input parameter accept?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input parameter accepts a Comfy dtype of STRING and a Python dtype of str."
