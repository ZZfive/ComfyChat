        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioFade node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFade node in ComfyUI is used to apply a fade-in or fade-out effect to an audio clip, enhancing its auditory transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltAudioFade node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SaltAudioFade node are the original audio data, the fade type ('in' for fade-in or 'out' for fade-out), and the fade duration in seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fade_type parameter specify in the SaltAudioFade node?",
        "answer": "The fade_type parameter in the SaltAudioFade node specifies the type of fade effect to apply. 'in' indicates a fade-in effect where the volume gradually increases, while 'out' indicates a fade-out effect where the volume gradually decreases."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the duration of the fade effect controlled in the SaltAudioFade node?",
        "answer": "The duration of the fade effect in the SaltAudioFade node is controlled by the fade_duration parameter, which is measured in seconds and determines the time it takes for the volume transition to complete."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the SaltAudioFade node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the SaltAudioFade node is fade_start, which specifies the starting point of the fade effect in the audio clip, measured in seconds. This allows for precise control over when the fade begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioFade node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioFade node is the modified audio data with the applied fade-in or fade-out effect, enhancing the auditory experience of the audio clip."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the SaltAudioFade node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFade node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
