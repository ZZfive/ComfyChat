        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Grid_Image node in ComfyUI is designed to process a series of images into a single grid image. It intelligently organizes the images into a specified number of columns, scales them to a maximum cell size, and optionally adds colored borders around each image to distinguish them visually."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images_path' parameter specify in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'images_path' parameter in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node specifies the directory path where the images to be processed are located. This path is crucial as it directs the node to the source location of the images that will be organized into a grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'pattern_glob' parameter be used in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'pattern_glob' parameter in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node is used to match specific files within the directory. It allows filtering images based on a certain pattern, which is particularly useful when not all files in the directory are images or when a specific set of images is needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'number_of_columns' parameter in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'number_of_columns' parameter in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node defines the number of columns in the resulting grid image. It determines how the images will be distributed across the width of the grid, affecting the overall layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'max_cell_size' parameter affect the images in the grid created by the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_cell_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node sets the maximum size (in pixels) for each image cell in the grid. This ensures that no image exceeds these dimensions after processing, maintaining consistency in appearance across the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'border_red', 'border_green', and 'border_blue' parameters determine in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'border_red', 'border_green', and 'border_blue' parameters in the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node together determine the color of the border around each image in the grid by specifying the red, green, and blue components of the RGB color value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Grid_Image node is the 'grid_image', which is the resulting image containing the processed grid of images. It represents the final visual layout as specified by the input parameters."
