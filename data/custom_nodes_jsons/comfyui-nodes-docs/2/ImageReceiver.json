        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageReceiver node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageReceiver node is designed to handle and receive image data, providing functionality for decoding, converting, and preparing image data for further analysis or processing within workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the ImageReceiver node is 'image', which specifies the source of the image data and can be a file path or reference to an image stored elsewhere."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'link_id' parameter in the ImageReceiver node do?",
        "answer": "The 'link_id' parameter in the ImageReceiver node serves as an identifier for linking or associating the image data with other elements in the workflow, providing flexibility in how images are linked or referenced."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'save_to_workflow' parameter affect the ImageReceiver node's behavior?",
        "answer": "The 'save_to_workflow' parameter determines whether the image data should be saved as part of the workflow for future use, which is useful for persisting data across different stages of the workflow without reprocessing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'image_data' parameter in the ImageReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_data' parameter contains the encoded image data that the node will decode and process, which should be a string representing base64 encoded image content that is then converted to a usable image format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'trigger_always' parameter do in the ImageReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger_always' parameter is a boolean flag that, when set to true, indicates the node should process the image unconditionally, ensuring the image is always processed even if other parameters suggest it may not need to be."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the ImageReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The ImageReceiver node provides two output types: 'IMAGE', which represents the processed image data in tensor format suitable for further analysis or processing, and 'MASK', which is an optional tensor representing a mask derived from the image data for tasks such as segmentation or identifying specific regions of interest."
