        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskOptFlow node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node in ComfyUI is used to apply a mask to the optical flow input, effectively filtering the optical flow data based on the provided mask. This operation is crucial for isolating relevant motion information from specific regions of interest in the optical flow data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node requires two input types: 'optical_flow' (Comfy dtype: OPTICAL_FLOW, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) representing the motion between two consecutive frames, and 'mask' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) used to filter the optical flow data and retain motion information only in the regions of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node outputs two types: 'OPTICAL_FLOW' (Comfy dtype: OPTICAL_FLOW, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) representing the filtered optical flow data with motion information only in the mask-specified regions, and 'PREVIEW_IMAGE' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) providing a visualization of the filtered optical flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskOptFlow node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the MaskOptFlow node belong?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Optical Flow' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskOptFlow node handle the mask and optical flow inputs?",
        "answer": "In the MaskOptFlow node, the mask is interpolated to match the shape of the optical flow, and then both the mask and the optical flow are multiplied element-wise. This operation effectively filters the optical flow data, retaining motion information only in the regions specified by the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_opt_flow' function in the MaskOptFlow node do?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_opt_flow' function in the MaskOptFlow node takes the optical flow and mask inputs, interpolates the mask to match the optical flow shape, and multiplies both the mask and optical flow element-wise. It then returns the filtered optical flow data and a visualization of the filtered optical flow."
