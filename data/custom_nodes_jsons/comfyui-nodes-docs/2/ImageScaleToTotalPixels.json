        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleToTotalPixels node is designed to scale an image to a specified total number of pixels. It provides various upscaling methods to ensure image quality is maintained during the scaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image or torch.Tensor), upscale_method (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), and megapixels (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_method' parameter in the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_method' parameter determines how the image will be resized. It is crucial for controlling the quality of the upscaled image, allowing users to choose between different algorithms that may produce varying results depending on the image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'megapixels' parameter in the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node define?",
        "answer": "The 'megapixels' parameter defines the target total number of pixels for the upscaled image. It is a key factor in the scaling process, determining the final dimensions of the image, i.e., its width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node is 'upscaled_image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image or torch.Tensor), which represents the result of the scaling process and contains the image adjusted to the specified total pixel size, following the chosen upscaling method to maintain quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available upscaling methods in the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node?",
        "answer": "The available upscaling methods in the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node are 'nearest-exact', 'bilinear', 'area', 'bicubic', and 'lanczos'."
