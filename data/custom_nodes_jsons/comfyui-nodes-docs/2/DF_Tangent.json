        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Tangent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Tangent node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the tangent or arctangent of a given value, with options to specify the angle measurement unit as either degrees or radians."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DF_Tangent node are: value (FLOAT), type_ (COMBO[STRING] to specify angle unit as RAD or DEG), and arcTan (COMBO[BOOLEAN] to determine whether to calculate arctangent or tangent)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' input represent in the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input in the DF_Tangent node represents the numeric value for which the tangent or arctangent needs to be calculated. It is essential for determining the specific angle or its tangent value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'type_' input affect the calculation in the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The 'type_' input in the DF_Tangent node specifies the angle measurement unit for the input value, which can be either radians (RAD) or degrees (DEG). This affects how the value is interpreted and processed in the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'arcTan' input in the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The 'arcTan' input is a boolean flag that determines whether to calculate the arctangent (True) or tangent (False) of the input value, providing flexibility for trigonometric calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Tangent node is a FLOAT, which represents the calculated tangent or arctangent value of the input, provided as a floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type and category of the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the DF_Tangent node is CPU, and its category is Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry."
