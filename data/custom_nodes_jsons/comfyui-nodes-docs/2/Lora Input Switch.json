        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node in the WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node acts as a conditional switch in the WAS Suite. It selects and forwards one of two sets of inputs based on the state of a Boolean parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node requires five inputs: model_a, clip_a, model_b, clip_b, and boolean. The model and clip inputs represent the two possible data flows, while the boolean input serves as the control signal for the switch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boolean' input determine in the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' input in the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node determines which set of inputs will be forwarded by the node. If the boolean parameter is true, the first set of inputs (model_a and clip_a) will be selected. If it is false, the alternative set of inputs (model_b and clip_b) will be chosen."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node is a tuple containing two elements: a MODEL and a CLIP. The specific values of these elements depend on the state of the boolean input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node determined?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node is determined by the state of the boolean input parameter. If the boolean parameter is true, the node will return the first set of inputs (model_a and clip_a). If it is false, the node will return the alternative set of inputs (model_b and clip_b)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category."
