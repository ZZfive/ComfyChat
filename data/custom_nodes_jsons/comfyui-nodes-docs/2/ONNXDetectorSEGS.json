        "question": "What is the primary function of the BboxDetectorForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorForEach node is designed to detect bounding boxes for each segment in an image. It uses bbox_detector to identify and locate segments based on provided thresholds and other parameters, ensuring only the most relevant segments are detected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'bbox_detector' input parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox_detector' is a crucial component of the BboxDetectorForEach node, responsible for the actual detection of bounding boxes within an image. It is essential for the execution of the node as it directly impacts the accuracy and efficiency of the detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node control?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter determines the sensitivity of the bbox_detector when identifying bounding boxes. It is an important adjustment factor that can influence the number of segments detected and the precision of the detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'dilation' parameter affect the detected bounding boxes in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' parameter controls the expansion of the detected bounding boxes. It plays a significant role in post-detection processing, potentially enhancing the coverage of the detected segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'crop_factor' parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_factor' parameter is used to adjust the size of the cropped segments after detection. It is crucial for fine-tuning the segmentation process to meet specific application needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'drop_size' parameter influence the detection process in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The 'drop_size' parameter specifies the minimum size of segments to be considered in the detection process. It is essential for filtering out noise and irrelevant data, thus improving the quality of the detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'labels' parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The 'labels' parameter allows specifying the types of segments to be detected. It is an optional but useful feature for focusing the detection on specific segments of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'detailer_hook' parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'detailer_hook' parameter provides a mechanism for custom post-processing of the detected bounding boxes. It is an advanced feature that can be used to integrate additional processing steps into the detection workflow."
