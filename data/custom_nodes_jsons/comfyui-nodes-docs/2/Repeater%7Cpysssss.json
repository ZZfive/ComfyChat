        "question": "What is the purpose of the Repeater node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Repeater node in ComfyUI is designed to repeat a given input source a specified number of times, and can output as a single node or multiple nodes depending on the selected mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Repeater node are 'source' (the data to be repeated), 'repeats' (the number of times to repeat the source), 'output' (determines whether the repeated data should be output as a single node or multiple nodes), and 'node_mode' (controls whether repeated nodes are reused or newly created)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output' parameter in the Repeater node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'output' parameter in the Repeater node determines whether the repeated data should be output as a single node or multiple nodes, affecting the structure of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'node_mode' parameter in the Repeater node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'node_mode' parameter in the Repeater node controls whether repeated nodes are reused or newly created, affecting how nodes are added to the graph during serialization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Repeater node is a list of the repeated data, which can have different structures depending on the 'output' and 'node_mode' parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'repeats' parameter in the Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'repeats' parameter in the Repeater node is 2."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what conditions will the Repeater node output multiple individual nodes?",
        "answer": "The Repeater node will output multiple individual nodes when the 'output' parameter is set to 'multi'."
