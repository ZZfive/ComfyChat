        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetSAMEmbedding node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetSAMEmbedding node is designed to generate a SAM embedding from an image using a specified SAM model. It adjusts the model to the appropriate device based on the execution mode and processes the image to generate its embedding, which is crucial for further image manipulation or analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the GetSAMEmbedding node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the GetSAMEmbedding node are the SAM model (sam_model) and the image to be processed. The SAM model determines the architecture and weights for processing the image, while the image is the input that will generate the SAM embedding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the GetSAMEmbedding node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the GetSAMEmbedding node is the device_mode, which specifies the device on which the SAM model should run (AUTO, Prefer GPU, or CPU). This affects the performance and efficiency of the embedding generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the GetSAMEmbedding node?",
        "answer": "The output of the GetSAMEmbedding node is the SAM embedding (sam_embedding) generated from the input image. This embedding is used for further processing or analysis in the image manipulation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the GetSAMEmbedding node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the GetSAMEmbedding node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the GetSAMEmbedding node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetSAMEmbedding node belongs to the Art Venture/Segmentation category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the GetSAMEmbedding node handle the device mode?",
        "answer": "The GetSAMEmbedding node adjusts the SAM model to the appropriate device based on the specified device_mode (AUTO, Prefer GPU, or CPU). If the device_mode is set to AUTO, the model is moved back to the CPU after the embedding generation is complete."
