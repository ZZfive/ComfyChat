        "question": "What is the purpose of the Triangle Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Triangle Curve node generates a triangular wave based on the current frame time, allowing the creation of animations with linear ascending and descending values within a specified period and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Triangle Curve node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Triangle Curve node are frame_counter, max_value, min_value, periodicity_seconds, and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_value' parameter define in the Triangle Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter defines the maximum value that the triangular wave can reach, representing the peak of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min_value' parameter define in the Triangle Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter defines the minimum value that the triangular wave can reach, representing the trough of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'periodicity_seconds' parameter affect the triangular wave?",
        "answer": "The 'periodicity_seconds' parameter determines the duration of a complete cycle of the triangular wave in seconds, thus defining its frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'phase' parameter in the Triangle Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter adjusts the starting point of the waveform within its period, allowing for phase shifting of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Triangle Curve node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Triangle Curve node are FLOAT, representing the calculated floating-point value of the triangular wave at the current frame time, and INT, representing the integer value of the calculated triangular wave rounded to the nearest integer."
