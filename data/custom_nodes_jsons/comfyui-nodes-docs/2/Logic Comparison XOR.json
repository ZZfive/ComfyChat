        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Logical_XOR node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_XOR node is designed to perform a logical XOR operation on two boolean inputs. It provides a simple and powerful mechanism for binary differences, which is fundamental in logical circuits and decision-making processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Logical_XOR node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_XOR node requires two boolean inputs: boolean_a and boolean_b. Both inputs are crucial for determining the result of the logical comparison, as the node's functionality depends on the evaluation of these two inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Logical_XOR node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Logical_XOR node is a single boolean value called 'result', which represents the mutually exclusive or non-relationship between the two inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Logical_XOR node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_XOR node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Logical_XOR node perform the XOR operation in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the WAS_Logical_XOR node performs the XOR operation by checking if boolean_a is not equal to boolean_b. The result of this comparison is returned as the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the parent class of WAS_Logical_XOR?",
        "answer": "The parent class of WAS_Logical_XOR is WAS_Logical_Comparisons."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can one find the repository reference for the WAS_Logical_XOR node?",
        "answer": "The repository reference for the WAS_Logical_XOR node can be found at https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui."
