        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageGenResolutionFromImage node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the generation resolution based on the input image. It analyzes the provided image dimensions and calculates the width and height to be applied for image generation, ensuring the output resolution is directly derived from the size of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is an image. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the output resolution by analyzing the image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node are IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH (INT) and IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT (INT), which are the image generation width and height calculated based on the input image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is one common node that can be used with the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "One common node that can be used with the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is SVD_img2vid_Conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for implementing the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is implemented using Python programming language."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the execute function in the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node do?",
        "answer": "The execute function in the ImageGenResolutionFromImage node takes an image as input, extracts its shape, and returns the width (W) and height (H) of the image."
