        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_CycleText node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_CycleText node in ComfyUI is designed to create animated text sequences by cycling through a predefined list of text items at specified time intervals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_CycleText node are 'mode' and 'text_list'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter determine in the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines the order in which the text items are cycled through in the CR_CycleText node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_list' parameter define in the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_list' parameter defines the list of text items that the CR_CycleText node will cycle through."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'frame_interval' parameter in the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' parameter specifies the time interval between each text change in the animation created by the CR_CycleText node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' parameter affect the animation sequence in the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter determines the number of times the text list will be cycled through in the animation sequence created by the CR_CycleText node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_CycleText node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter represents the current position in the text animation and is used to track the progress of the animation in the CR_CycleText node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CR_CycleText node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_CycleText node provides two outputs: 'STRING', which provides the current text item from the cycling text list, and 'show_help', which provides a link to documentation for further help or details about the node's operation."
