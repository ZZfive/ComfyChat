        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalIPAdapterMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalIPAdapterMask node in ComfyUI is used to apply regional image processing adaptations using a mask, allowing for targeted adjustments to specific areas of an image during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node are: mask, image, weight, noise, weight_type, start_at, end_at, and unfold_batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter specify in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node specifies the region of the image that will be affected by the IPAdapter, allowing for targeted adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'weight' parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node determines the strength of the influence embedded within the masked area, providing a way to balance between the original and adapted aspects of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters are available in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node are: faceid_v2, weight_v2, combine_embeds, and neg_image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RegionalIPAdapterMask node is a conditional model or process based on the specified regional parameters, which can be used for further image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The RegionalIPAdapterMask node requires a GPU infrastructure type."
