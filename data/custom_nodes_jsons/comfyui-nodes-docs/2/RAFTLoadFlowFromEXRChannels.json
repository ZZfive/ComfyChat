        "question": "What is the purpose of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node in ComfyUI is used to load motion flow from EXR image files, specifically from the vector channel in Blender's Cycles renderer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node are: path (STRING), x_channel (['R', 'G', 'B', 'A']), y_channel (['R', 'G', 'B', 'A']), invert_x (['false', 'true']), and invert_y (['false', 'true'])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'path' input specify in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'path' input in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node specifies the file path of the EXR image from which the motion flow will be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'x_channel' and 'y_channel' inputs affect the motion flow in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_channel' and 'y_channel' inputs in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node determine the EXR image channels (R, G, B, A) used for the x and y components of the motion flow, respectively, influencing how motion is interpreted along the x and y axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'invert_x' and 'invert_y' inputs in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert_x' and 'invert_y' inputs in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node are boolean flags that indicate whether to invert the motion flow along the x and y axes, respectively, allowing for adjustment of the motion direction when necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node is 'raft_flow' (RAFT_FLOW), which is a tensor representing the motion flow extracted from the specified EXR channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the output 'raft_flow' from the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node be used for?",
        "answer": "The output 'raft_flow' from the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node can be used for further motion analysis or visualization tasks."
