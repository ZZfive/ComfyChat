        "question": "What is the purpose of the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node in ComfyUI is designed to manage the loading and caching of model checkpoints in a shared manner, allowing for efficient reuse of loaded checkpoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node handle checkpoint loading?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node checks if a checkpoint is already cached before loading it from disk, which enables efficient reuse of loaded checkpoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two modes supported by the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node supports two modes: read-only and overwrite cache, to accommodate different usage scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'key_opt' parameter in the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node?",
        "answer": "The 'key_opt' parameter in the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node allows for optional identification of checkpoints in the cache, enabling more flexible caching strategies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node are: model, CLIP, VAE, and cache key."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the 'mode' parameter is set to 'Override Cache' in the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node?",
        "answer": "When the 'mode' parameter is set to 'Override Cache', the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node loads the checkpoint from disk and updates the cache, even if the checkpoint is already cached."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared node is CPU."
