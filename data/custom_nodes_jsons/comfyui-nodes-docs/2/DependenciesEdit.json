        "question": "What is the purpose of the DependenciesEdit node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DependenciesEdit node in ComfyUI is designed to modify and update the dependencies required for the art generation process, allowing customization of various components such as VAE models, checkpoints, CLIP models, and more."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the core input type required by the DependenciesEdit node?",
        "answer": "The core input type required by the DependenciesEdit node is 'dependencies', which is a tuple containing the current set of dependencies that the node will modify based on other input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DependenciesEdit node allow for customization of the art generation pipeline?",
        "answer": "The DependenciesEdit node allows for customization of the art generation pipeline by providing optional input parameters such as 'ckpt_name', 'vae_name', 'clip', 'clip_skip', 'positive', 'negative', 'lora_stack', and 'cnet_stack', which can be adjusted according to specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip_skip' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node control?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_skip' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node sets the number of layers to skip in the CLIP model, allowing for optimization of performance or accuracy as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'lora_stack' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node enhance the art generation process?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_stack' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node specifies the LoRA stack to be applied, enabling advanced model adaptation and fine-tuning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cnet_stack' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node?",
        "answer": "The 'cnet_stack' parameter in the DependenciesEdit node determines the ControlNet stack to be used, facilitating precise control over the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DependenciesEdit node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DependenciesEdit node is 'dependencies', which reflects the updated set of dependencies after modifications have been made based on the input parameters."
