        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskedFill node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskedFill node in ComfyUI performs image inpainting by filling in missing or masked areas of an image, matching the surrounding context for seamless integration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the MaskedFill node are 'image' (the base image for inpainting), 'mask' (defines the areas to be filled), and 'fill' (determines the inpainting method to be used)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'image' parameter in the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "In the MaskedFill node, the 'image' parameter has the Comfy data type of IMAGE and the Python data type of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the MaskedFill node defines the areas of the image that require inpainting, guiding the node to determine where the image content needs to be filled or modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inpainting methods can be selected using the 'fill' parameter in the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "The 'fill' parameter in the MaskedFill node allows the selection of inpainting methods such as 'neutral', 'telea', or 'navier-stokes' to significantly influence the quality and style of the filled content."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the optional 'falloff' parameter affect the inpainting process in the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'falloff' parameter in the MaskedFill node affects the smoothness of the inpainting transition by controlling the radius of erosion and blur operations, determining how the filled areas blend with the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskedFill node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskedFill node is an image where the masked areas have been filled with content that matches the surrounding context, providing a seamless and visually coherent final image."
