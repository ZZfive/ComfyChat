        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageDrawLineByContainer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawLineByContainer node is designed to draw lines on an image by specifying the start and end points, color, and other drawing parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'container' parameter in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'container' parameter represents the image data on which the line will be drawn. It is crucial for determining the dimensions and canvas for line drawing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the line thickness specified in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The line thickness is specified using the 'size' parameter, which is an integer value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the 'start_x' and 'start_y' parameters in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_x' and 'start_y' parameters, which represent the starting coordinates of the line, have the data type FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'red', 'green', 'blue', and 'alpha' parameters represent in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'red', 'green', 'blue', and 'alpha' parameters represent the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) components of the line color, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'SSAA' parameter in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'SSAA' parameter specifies the supersampling anti-aliasing factor, which is used to improve the quality of line drawing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' parameter determine in the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter determines the drawing method or algorithm used for line rendering."
