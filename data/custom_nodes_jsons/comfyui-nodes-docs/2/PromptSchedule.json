        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptSchedule node in ComfyUI FizzNodes?",
        "answer": "The PromptSchedule node in ComfyUI FizzNodes is responsible for managing and animating text prompts at specified frame numbers. It creates smooth transitions between prompts by interpolating keyframes and applying weights to control the influence of each keyframe."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PromptSchedule node are: 'text', 'max_frames', 'current_frame', 'print_output', and 'clip'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_frames' parameter determine in the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' parameter determines the total number of frames the animation will run for. It is a key factor in the overall duration and pacing of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'clip' parameter in the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter is a reference to the CLIP model used for text encoding within the node. It plays a crucial role in converting text prompts into a suitable format for animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the PromptSchedule node are: 'pw_a', 'pre_text', and 'app_text'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pw_a' parameter affect in the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'pw_a' parameter is a float that represents the weight applied to the current frame's animation. It influences the transitions between prompts and helps smooth out the overall animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PromptSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The PromptSchedule node outputs two types: 'POS' and 'NEG'. 'POS' represents the positive conditioning for the current frame's animation, while 'NEG' represents the negative conditioning."
