        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchNormalizeLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchNormalizeLatent node applies batch normalization to latent representations in ComfyUI, adjusting the distribution of each latent sample to a standard distribution, which can stabilize and potentially improve the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BatchNormalizeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BatchNormalizeLatent node are 'latents' (the latent representations to be normalized) and 'factor' (a scaling factor for interpolating between the original and normalized latents)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input control in the BatchNormalizeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input controls the interpolation between the original latent representations and the normalized latent representations, allowing adjustable control over the normalization effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BatchNormalizeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BatchNormalizeLatent node is 'latent', which represents the normalized latent representations that have been adjusted based on the specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for running the BatchNormalizeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the BatchNormalizeLatent node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the BatchNormalizeLatent node belong?",
        "answer": "The BatchNormalizeLatent node belongs to the 'latent/filters' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchNormalizeLatent node modify the latent representations?",
        "answer": "The BatchNormalizeLatent node modifies the latent representations by applying batch normalization, which adjusts the distribution of each latent sample to a standard distribution, and then interpolates between the original and normalized latents based on the specified factor."
