        "question": "What is the purpose of the InjectNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InjectNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to introduce noise into a set of latent representations, simulating the effect of noise on the generation process. Its role is to enhance the data in a controlled manner, which can improve the robustness and diversity of the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InjectNoise node are 'latents' and 'strength'. 'latents' contains the original latent representations that will undergo noise injection, directly affecting the result of the noise enhancement process. 'strength' determines the intensity of the noise to be injected into the latents, which is crucial for controlling the degree of variation introduced into the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'noise' parameter in InjectNoise node provide?",
        "answer": "The optional 'noise' parameter in the InjectNoise node provides the source of noise to be applied to the latents. It is important because it allows customization of the noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "When provided, the 'mask' parameter in the InjectNoise node specifies which areas of the latents should be affected by the noise. This is important for targeted application of noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InjectNoise node is 'latents'. The output 'latents' are the modified latent representations that have had noise injected into them, ready for further processing or generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the InjectNoise node use?",
        "answer": "The InjectNoise node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens in the InjectNoise node if the 'noise' parameter is not provided?",
        "answer": "If the 'noise' parameter is not provided in the InjectNoise node, the function will return the original 'latents' unchanged."
