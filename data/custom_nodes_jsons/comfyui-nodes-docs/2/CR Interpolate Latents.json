        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_InterpolateLatents node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_InterpolateLatents node is used to perform interpolation between two latent representations, providing smooth transitions between states. It is crucial for creating seamless animations or transformations within a given data space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_InterpolateLatents node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_InterpolateLatents node are: latent1 (the first latent representation), latent2 (the second latent representation), weight (influences the degree of interpolation between the two latent states), and method (determines the algorithm used for transitioning between latent states)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight' parameter in the CR_InterpolateLatents node control?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in the CR_InterpolateLatents node controls the degree of interpolation between the two latent states. It is essential for controlling the speed and range of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_InterpolateLatents node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_InterpolateLatents node produces two output types: LATENT (the output latent state resulting from the interpolation process, representing a blend of the input latent states) and show_help (a URL linking to documentation for further assistance and understanding of the interpolation process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the CR_InterpolateLatents node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CR_InterpolateLatents node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'weight' parameter in the CR_InterpolateLatents node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'weight' parameter in the CR_InterpolateLatents node is 0.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_InterpolateLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_InterpolateLatents node provides a URL linking to documentation for further assistance and understanding of the interpolation process."
