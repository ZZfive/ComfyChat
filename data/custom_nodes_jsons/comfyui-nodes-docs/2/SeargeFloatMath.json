        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeFloatMath node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFloatMath node in ComfyUI is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, providing a straightforward method to manipulate these values in a broader computational context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available operations in the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFloatMath node offers operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and a combination of multiplication and addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'op' parameter in the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the SeargeFloatMath node is crucial as it determines the arithmetic operation to be executed, thereby influencing the outcome of the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'a', 'b', and 'c' parameters in the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The 'a', 'b', and 'c' parameters in the SeargeFloatMath node represent operands in the arithmetic operation. Their values significantly affect the final result, making them integral to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'result' in the SeargeFloatMath node represent?",
        "answer": "The output 'result' in the SeargeFloatMath node represents the result of the arithmetic operation executed, directly reflecting the input parameters and the selected operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeFloatMath node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFloatMath node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code of the SeargeFloatMath node, what does the 'get_value' function do?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the SeargeFloatMath node, the 'get_value' function performs the selected arithmetic operation based on the 'op' parameter and the provided operands 'a', 'b', and 'c', returning the result."
