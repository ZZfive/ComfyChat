        "question": "What is the purpose of the GreyNoise class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GreyNoise class in ComfyUI is used to generate noise images on-demand, providing tools for various image processing tasks and noise analysis through customizable parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the GreyNoise class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the GreyNoise class are width, height, and seed. Width determines the horizontal dimension of the noise image, height sets the vertical dimension, and seed initializes the random number generator for repeatable noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the value_min parameter control in the GreyNoise class?",
        "answer": "The value_min parameter in the GreyNoise class sets the lower limit for noise intensity, affecting the minimum possible noise level in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the red_min parameter affect the noise image in the GreyNoise class?",
        "answer": "The red_min parameter in the GreyNoise class specifies the minimum value for the red channel, influencing the overall hue and color distribution in the noise image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GreyNoise class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GreyNoise class is an IMAGE, which is a visual representation of the noise image reflecting the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the GreyNoise class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the GreyNoise class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the GreyNoise class generate the noise image?",
        "answer": "The GreyNoise class generates the noise image by initializing a new RGB image with the specified width and height, seeding a random number generator, and setting the color channel values based on the input parameters. It then iterates through each pixel, assigning random noise values within the specified ranges."
