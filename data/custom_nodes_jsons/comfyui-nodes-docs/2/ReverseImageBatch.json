        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReverseImageBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node is used to reverse the order of images in a batch, providing a simple and effective method for image sequence operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input requirement for the ReverseImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node requires an input of 'images', which must be a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output provided by the ReverseImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node outputs an 'image' which is the reversed order of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the runtime environment recommended for the ReverseImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node is recommended to be run in an 'Infra' type of GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ReverseImageBatch node do to the input images?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node reverses the order of the input images using the torch.flip function and returns the reversed batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ComfyUI language model used for?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI language model, particularly the ReverseImageBatch node, is used to manipulate image sequences efficiently."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the ReverseImageBatch node manage multiple types of images?",
        "answer": "The ReverseImageBatch node can manage batches of images, though the input of 'images' implies a single batch is expected as input."
