    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Kep_RepeatList node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Kep_RepeatList node are 'In', which is the input list to be repeated, and 'Count', an integer specifying the number of times the input list should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Count' parameter in the Kep_RepeatList node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'Count' parameter in the Kep_RepeatList node specifies the number of times the input list should be repeated. It determines the final length of the output list by multiplying the length of the original list."
