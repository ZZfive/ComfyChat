        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node is designed to merge multiple conditioning inputs into a single conditioning output. It supports combining up to five conditioning inputs, allowing flexibility in integrating various conditioning elements into a unified representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of conditioning inputs that the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node can handle?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node can handle up to five conditioning inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the required input 'conditioning_i' in the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the required input 'conditioning_i' is unknown, but it represents the conditioning data to be merged. The structure and content of each conditioning input are crucial to the node's functionality and the final merged result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node is 'conditioning', which is a merged conditioning output that integrates up to five individual conditioning inputs into a unified representation. This output encapsulates the combined characteristics of all input conditions and can be used for subsequent processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' specified for the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' specified for the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the execute function in the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node do?",
        "answer": "The execute function in the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node takes the required conditioning inputs (conditioning_1 and conditioning_2) and optional conditioning inputs (conditioning_3, conditioning_4, and conditioning_5) and combines them into a single conditioning output. It returns a tuple containing the merged conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the execute function handle optional conditioning inputs in the ConditioningCombineMultiple+ node?",
        "answer": "The execute function checks if the optional conditioning inputs (conditioning_3, conditioning_4, and conditioning_5) are not None. If they are not None, it appends them to the merged conditioning data using the += operator."
