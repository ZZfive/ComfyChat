        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeedEverywhere node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeedEverywhere node ensures the reproducibility of random operations in different parts of the system by setting a seed for the random number generator, which is crucial for scientific experiments and simulations requiring consistent results."
    },
    {
        "question": "The 'seed' parameter is essential for initializing the random number generator to a known state, ensuring that subsequent random operations produce the same results each time the node is executed, which is crucial for obtaining consistent and comparable results across various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'seed' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'seed' parameter is of the INT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'id' parameter in the SeedEverywhere node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'id' parameter serves as an identifier for messages sent by the node, which can be particularly useful in systems running multiple instances of the node simultaneously, as it helps track and manage messages from different instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'id' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'id' parameter is of the UNIQUE_ID data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SeedEverywhere node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeedEverywhere node is INT, representing the state of the random number generator after the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeedEverywhere node use?",
        "answer": "The SeedEverywhere node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
