        "question": "What is the purpose of the Framed Mask Grab Cut node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Framed Mask Grab Cut node in ComfyUI applies the GrabCut algorithm to segment the foreground and background of an image using a frame-based approach, allowing specific regions to be designated as foreground or background to improve the accuracy of the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Framed Mask Grab Cut node are: image, thresh, iterations, margin, frame_option, threshold_FGD, threshold_PR_FGD, and output_format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'iterations' parameter control in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node controls the number of iterations the GrabCut algorithm will run, affecting the refinement of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'frame_option' parameter be used to control the segmentation process in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_option' parameter in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node allows including or excluding certain frame regions as background, providing more control over the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'threshold_FGD' and 'threshold_PR_FGD' parameters in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold_FGD' and 'threshold_PR_FGD' parameters in the Framed Mask Grab Cut node are used to classify pixels as definite foreground and probable foreground, respectively, aiding in the creation and refinement of the initial segmentation mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible output formats for the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The possible output formats for the Framed Mask Grab Cut node are a segmented mask or an image with the background removed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Framed Mask Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Framed Mask Grab Cut node is an image, which is the obtained foreground segmentation mask after applying the GrabCut algorithm."
