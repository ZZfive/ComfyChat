        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node is designed to extract and provide the width and height dimensions from a given tensor representing latent space data, which is crucial for operations that require spatial dimensions for further processing or analysis within the WAS Suite in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'samples' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is essential as it serves as the input tensor containing the latent space data. The node relies on this tensor to calculate the width and height dimensions, which are critical for subsequent numerical operations or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tensor_w_num' output parameter represent in the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'tensor_w_num' output parameter represents the width of the input tensor's spatial dimensions, which is important for applications that need to know the tensor width for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tensor_h_num' output parameter represent in the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'tensor_h_num' output parameter represents the height of the input tensor's spatial dimensions. It plays a key role in applications that require the tensor height for subsequent tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'width_float' output in the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'width_float' output provides the width of the input tensor in floating-point format, which is useful for algorithms that require the fractional precision of the tensor width."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'height_float' output in the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'height_float' output provides the height of the input tensor with floating-point precision, making it particularly suitable for applications that need an accurate decimal representation of the tensor height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for the WAS_Latent_Size_To_Number node is CPU."
