        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_IntegerMultipleOf node is designed to multiply an integer by a specified multiple, ensuring the result is an integer multiple of the given factor. It is particularly useful in situations where consistent increments or scaling factors need to be maintained, such as in mathematical calculations or data processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'integer' parameter in the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node?",
        "answer": "The 'integer' parameter serves as the base number that is multiplied by the 'multiple' parameter. It plays a fundamental role in the node's operation, as it determines the starting point of the multiplication process. The execution and result of the node are directly influenced by the value of this parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiple' parameter define in the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiple' parameter defines the factor by which the 'integer' will be multiplied. Its significance lies in its ability to determine the scaling of the base integer. The result of the node largely depends on this parameter, as it allows control over the desired level of increment in the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INT' output represent in the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node?",
        "answer": "The 'INT' output represents the result of the input integer multiplied by the specified multiple. It is the primary output of the node, reflecting the core functionality of the node to perform integer multiplication based on a given factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, offering additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node. This auxiliary output enhances the user experience by providing easy access to help resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_IntegerMultipleOf node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'multiple' parameter is set to 0 in the CR_IntegerMultipleOf node?",
        "answer": "If the 'multiple' parameter is set to 0, the node will return the original input integer without any multiplication applied, along with the 'show_help' URL."
