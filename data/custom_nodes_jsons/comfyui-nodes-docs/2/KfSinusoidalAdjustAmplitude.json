        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node is designed to adjust the amplitude of a sinusoidal curve, allowing for fine-tuning of the shape without altering its basic properties such as wavelength and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'curve' parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' parameter is essential as it defines the base sinusoidal curve whose amplitude is to be adjusted. It directly influences the output, determining the shape and characteristics of the modified curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'adjustment' parameter play in the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The 'adjustment' parameter is used to modify the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve, allowing precise control over the curve's peaks and troughs. It plays a crucial role in customizing the curve according to specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'curve' represent in the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The output 'curve' represents the modified sinusoidal curve with the adjusted amplitude, which is the result of the node's operation. It is important as it conveys the final shape that can be used for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'sinusoidal_curve' output in the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The 'sinusoidal_curve' output is identical to the modified curve, emphasizing the node's primary function of adjusting the amplitude while preserving other properties of the curve. It is particularly useful for applications that require the final sinusoidal shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code of the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the KfSinusoidalAdjustAmplitude node is written in Python."
