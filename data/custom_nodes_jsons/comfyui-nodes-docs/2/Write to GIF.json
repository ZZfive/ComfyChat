        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node in ComfyUI is designed to create animated GIFs from a series of images or frames. It provides functionality to manage transitions between frames, control the delay between them, and set the looping behavior of the GIF."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node are 'image', which is the input image or series of images used to create the GIF animation frames, and 'transition_frames', which is the number of transition frames to generate between each pair of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image_delay_ms' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_delay_ms' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node controls the delay time in milliseconds before each frame transition starts. This parameter is important for timing the animation and can be adjusted to create the desired effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'max_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node specifies the maximum size of the output GIF in pixels. This parameter is useful for resizing the animation to fit specific display requirements or constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node produce?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node produces three output types: 'image_pass', which is the processed image or series of images used to create the GIF; 'filepath_text', which is the full file path of the created GIF animation; and 'filename_text', which is the name of the created GIF file."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node affect the GIF animation?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node determines the number of times the GIF will loop. A value of 0 indicates that the GIF will loop infinitely."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'output_path' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'output_path' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF_Writer node is the ComfyUI output directory, specified as 'comfy_paths.output_directory'."
