        "question": "What is the purpose of the BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to pre-process images by applying binarization thresholding techniques. It converts the image into a binary image (black and white) based on a specified threshold, which is useful for highlighting certain features or simplifying the image for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the BinaryPreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image to be processed. It is the main data for performing the binarization thresholding operation. The Comfy dtype for this input is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bin_threshold' parameter specify in the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'bin_threshold' parameter in the BinaryPreprocessor node specifies the critical value for converting pixel values in the image to black or white. Pixels higher than this threshold will turn white, while those below this threshold will turn black, helping to extract salient features from the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resolution' parameter specify in the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the BinaryPreprocessor node specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before applying the binarization threshold. This allows for consistent processing of images that may have different original resolutions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BinaryPreprocessor node is 'image', which is a binarized (black and white) version of the input image. The conversion is based on the specified 'bin_threshold' value. The Comfy dtype for this output is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the BinaryPreprocessor node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the BinaryPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BinaryPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
