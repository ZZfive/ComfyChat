        "question": "What is the purpose of the VividSharpen node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VividSharpen node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the clarity and sharpness of images by applying a sharpening algorithm. It adjusts visual details to create a more vivid and clear appearance, suitable for post-processing tasks in image editing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'images' input parameter in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input parameter in the VividSharpen node is the input for the sharpening process. It is crucial as it determines the content to be enhanced. The quality and resolution of the input images directly affect the sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'radius' parameter control in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter in the VividSharpen node controls the range of the blurring effect applied before sharpening. It is an important adjustment factor that influences the degree of sharpness in the output image, allowing fine control over the final visual appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the sharpening effect in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the VividSharpen node defines the intensity of the sharpening effect. It is important as it allows the user to control the aggressiveness of the sharpening, resulting in images with different levels of detail and clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VividSharpen node is the 'images' that have been processed by the sharpening algorithm, resulting in enhanced sharpness and clarity. They are ready for further use or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the VividSharpen node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VividSharpen node handle multiple input images?",
        "answer": "If there are multiple input images, the VividSharpen node processes each image individually by converting it to PIL format, applying the vivid_sharpen function, and then converting it back to tensor format. The results are then concatenated along dimension 0."
