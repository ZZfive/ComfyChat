        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ImageOutput node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ImageOutput node is used to manage image data output, providing the ability to save or preview images. It allows for custom file naming and formatting, playing a key role in ensuring that the results are easily accessible and well-organized in image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_ImageOutput node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_ImageOutput node include 'images', 'output_type', and 'file_format'. The 'images' parameter is crucial as it defines the input image data that the node will process. The 'output_type' parameter decides whether the node will save the images to disk or preview them. The 'file_format' parameter specifies the format in which the images will be saved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'filename_prefix' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node do?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node sets the base name for the output files, which is important for organizing and identifying saved images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'prefix_presets' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node assist in organizing files?",
        "answer": "The 'prefix_presets' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node allows for the addition of date-based prefixes to filenames, which is useful for sorting and archiving files chronologically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'trigger' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node?",
        "answer": "When set to True, the 'trigger' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node initiates an action or signal within the workflow, potentially triggering subsequent processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of data can be embedded into PNG files using the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the CR_ImageOutput node allows for embedding additional metadata into PNG files, enhancing the information associated with the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_ImageOutput node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_ImageOutput node include 'ui' and 'result'. The 'ui' output contains a list of image objects with metadata, which is important for providing the necessary visual and contextual information of the processed images to the user interface. The 'result' output represents the completion status of the node operation and provides a URL for further assistance if needed."
