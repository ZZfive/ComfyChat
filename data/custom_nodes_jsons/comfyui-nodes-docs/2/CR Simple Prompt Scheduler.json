        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SimplePromptScheduler node is used to manage and schedule prompts based on a list of keyframes, allowing for automatic changes to prompts at specific frames without manual intervention."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node are keyframe_list (STRING) and current_frame (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'keyframe_list' parameter define in the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_list' parameter defines the sequence of prompts and their corresponding frames, enabling the node to effectively schedule prompts and ensure the correct prompt is displayed at the right time in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_SimplePromptScheduler node provides the following output types: current_prompt (STRING), next_prompt (STRING), weight (FLOAT), and show_help (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'weight' output of the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node contribute to the animation?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' output represents the transition weight between the current prompt and the next prompt. It is used for interpolating prompts to achieve gradual changes and enhance the smoothness of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a link to the documentation for further help, which is useful for users who need more information about the node's functionality or require troubleshooting support."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CR_SimplePromptScheduler node is CPU."
