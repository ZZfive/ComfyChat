        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'doit' method in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node is used to check if a given list of segments is empty, with a particular focus on the second element in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it important to check the content of the 'segs' parameter in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "Checking the content of the 'segs' parameter is crucial for the operation of the 'doit' method because it determines whether the second paragraph is non-empty, which is vital for the node's decision-making process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'segs' parameter in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'segs' parameter is of type SEGS. In Python, it is of type List[Any]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output represents whether the second element in the 'segs' list is non-empty. It is a boolean value that directly affects subsequent logic or operations based on the condition check performed by the 'doit' method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'doit' method in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'doit' method in the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node is BOOLEAN in ComfyUI and bool in Python."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImpactNotEmptySEGS node is ImpactPack/Logic."
