        "question": "What is the purpose of the ColorImage class?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the ColorImage class is to generate images with a specified color and size. It is an extension of the ComfyUI framework and is part of the ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerUtility category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ColorImage class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ColorImage class are size, custom_width, custom_height, and color. The size input can be set to 'custom' along with custom_width and custom_height for specifying custom dimensions. The color input is a string representing the color of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the ColorImage class?",
        "answer": "The output type provided by the ColorImage class is image, which is a tensor representing the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one use the ColorImage class to generate an image?",
        "answer": "To use the ColorImage class to generate an image, one needs to provide the desired size, width, height, and color. If the size is set to 'custom', the width and height can be specified. Once the inputs are provided, the class generates the image tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is meant by 'size_as' in the ColorImage class?",
        "answer": "The 'size_as' parameter in the ColorImage class is an optional input that allows the user to use an existing image as a reference for generating the new image. This parameter is used to specify the size of the new image based on the dimensions of the reference image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INPUT_TYPES' method of the ColorImageV2 class return?",
        "answer": "The 'INPUT_TYPES' method of the ColorImageV2 class returns a dictionary that defines the input types required for the class, including the size, custom_width, custom_height, and color inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'image' output processed in the ColorImageV2 class?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the ColorImageV2 class is processed by creating a new RGB image with the specified width, height, and color. This image is then converted to a tensor and returned as the output."
