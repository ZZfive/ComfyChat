        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node allows conditional selection between two image inputs based on a boolean value, serving as a control flow mechanism in image processing pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node are 'on_true' (image when boolean condition is true), 'on_false' (image when boolean condition is false), and 'boolean' (the condition determining which image to select)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node is 'image', which is the selected image based on the boolean condition evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node use?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node determine which image to output?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node determines which image to output based on the 'boolean' input. If 'boolean' is true, it outputs the 'on_true' image; otherwise, it outputs the 'on_false' image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node in ComfyUI is 'crystools ðŸª›/Switch'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
