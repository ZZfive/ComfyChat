        "question": "What is the purpose of the Frame Counter (Simple) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter (Simple) node in ComfyUI is used to generate a frame counter based on the specified frame index, total number of frames, and frames per second. It is designed to assist in the animation creation process by tracking and managing frame progress."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Frame Counter (Simple) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Counter (Simple) node are: frame_index (INT), total_frames (INT), and frames_per_second (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frame_index input specify in the Frame Counter (Simple) node?",
        "answer": "In the Frame Counter (Simple) node, the frame_index input specifies the current frame index. It is crucial for determining the starting point of the frame counter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the total_frames input affect the Frame Counter (Simple) node?",
        "answer": "The total_frames input in the Frame Counter (Simple) node defines the total number of frames in the animation sequence. It sets an upper limit for the frame counter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the frames_per_second input play in the Frame Counter (Simple) node?",
        "answer": "The frames_per_second input in the Frame Counter (Simple) node specifies the number of frames played per second, determining the frame rate. It affects the timing and speed of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Frame Counter (Simple) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Frame Counter (Simple) node is a FrameCounter object, which is initialized with the current frame, total frames, and frames per second. It is used for further control of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the Frame Counter (Simple) node require any infra type?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Frame Counter (Simple) node requires the 'CPU' infra type."
