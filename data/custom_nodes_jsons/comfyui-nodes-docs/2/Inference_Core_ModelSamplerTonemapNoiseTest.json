        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node in ComfyUI applies tonemapping techniques to modify the noise prediction vector magnitude in the model sampler, aiming to improve image generation quality by adjusting contrast and brightness based on the Reinhard tonemapping algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two required inputs for the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node?",
        "answer": "The two required inputs for the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node are 'model', which is the model to which the tonemapping technique will be applied, and 'multiplier', which is a scalar value used to adjust the strength of the tonemapping effect applied to the noise prediction vector magnitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node is the modified model with its sampler configuration updated to include the tonemapping technique, aimed at improving image generation quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' input affect the tonemapping effect in the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' input in the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node adjusts the strength of the tonemapping effect applied to the noise prediction vector magnitude, allowing fine-tuning of the image's contrast and brightness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node use?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node uses the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node classified?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node is classified in the 'custom_node_experiments' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'multiplier' input in the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'multiplier' input in the Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node is 1.0."
