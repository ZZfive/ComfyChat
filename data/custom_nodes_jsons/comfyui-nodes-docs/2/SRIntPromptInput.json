        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the SRIntPromptInput node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the SRIntPromptInput node is to integrate integer inputs into a structured prompt format, playing a crucial role in data preprocessing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'input_int' parameter in the SRIntPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_int' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it represents the integer value to be merged into the prompt. Its correct input is vital for the structured format of the prompt and affects subsequent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'unique_id' parameter important in the SRIntPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter, a unique identifier used to reference specific entries within the prompt, is important because it ensures that the integer input is correctly associated with the intended context within the prompt structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'prompt' parameter play in the SRIntPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter, a dictionary containing structured prompt information, is crucial for the node as it is where the integer input is embedded, influencing the final output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the SRIntPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter, although optional, can provide additional context or metadata that might be relevant to the prompt. It enhances the richness of the structured data and can influence how subsequent nodes interpret the prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_int' parameter represent in the SRIntPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_int' parameter represents the original integer value that has been successfully integrated into the prompt. It signifies the completion of the node's main function and is important for the continuity of the data flow in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SRIntPromptInput node use?",
        "answer": "The SRIntPromptInput node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
