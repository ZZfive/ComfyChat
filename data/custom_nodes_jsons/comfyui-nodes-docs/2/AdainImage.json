        "question": "What is the purpose of AdainImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AdainImage node in ComfyUI applies Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to process a batch of images, adjusting the style of the input images based on the statistical features of a reference image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the AdainImage node are 'images' (the input images to be stylized), 'reference' (the reference image from which style features are extracted), and 'factor' (a factor controlling the strength of style transfer)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input control in the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the AdainImage node controls the strength of style transfer, allowing for mixing between the original image and the stylized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AdainImage node is 'image', which represents the stylized image after applying Adaptive Instance Normalization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for running the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for running the AdainImage node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the AdainImage node do in its batch_normalize function?",
        "answer": "In the batch_normalize function, the AdainImage node applies Adaptive Instance Normalization to the input images based on the mean and standard deviation of the reference image, and then interpolates between the original and stylized images using the 'factor' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the AdainImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the AdainImage node in ComfyUI is 'image/filters'."
