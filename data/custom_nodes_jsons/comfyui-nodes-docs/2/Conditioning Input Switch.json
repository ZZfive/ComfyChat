        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch class in ComfyUI is designed to conditionally select between two input conditions based on a boolean flag. It acts as a logic switch in workflows, allowing for dynamic routing of data based on specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node are 'conditioning_a' and 'conditioning_b', both of which are of the Comfy dtype CONDITIONING and Python dtype Union[str, comfy.sd.CONDITIONING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning_a' parameter in the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning_a' parameter represents the first input condition that will be selected when the boolean flag is true. It plays a key role in determining the output of the node as it directly impacts the data passed through the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning_b' parameter in the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning_b' parameter is the alternative input condition that will be used when the boolean flag is false. It is crucial for providing an alternate path for the data flow when the condition is not met, ensuring the node's flexibility in handling different scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter serves as the control signal that decides which conditional input is selected. When set to true, 'conditioning_a' is selected; when set to false, 'conditioning_b' is selected. It is a key parameter as it directly determines the behavior of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node is 'selected_conditioning', which represents the input condition selected based on the provided boolean flag. It is of the Comfy dtype CONDITIONING and Python dtype Union[str, comfy.sd.CONDITIONING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Conditioning_Input_Switch node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
