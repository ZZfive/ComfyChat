        "question": "What is the purpose of the MotionctrlSampleSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MotionctrlSampleSimple node in ComfyUI is designed to generate and control motion sequences using a series of models and sampling techniques. It utilizes the capabilities of motion control models to create coherent and realistic motion trajectories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MotionctrlSampleSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MotionctrlSampleSimple node are: model (MOTIONCTRL), steps (INT), and context_overlap (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter affect the motion sequence generation in the MotionctrlSampleSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter determines the number of steps to be used during the sampling process in the MotionctrlSampleSimple node. It influences the granularity of the motion sequence and may impact the quality of the generated motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'context_overlap' parameter specify in the MotionctrlSampleSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'context_overlap' parameter in the MotionctrlSampleSimple node specifies the amount of overlap between context frames and generated frames. It is important for creating smooth transitions and ensuring the coherence of the motion sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MotionctrlSampleSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MotionctrlSampleSimple node is IMAGE, which represents a sequence of images that reflect the generated motion based on the input parameters and the underlying motion control model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the MotionctrlSampleSimple node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the MotionctrlSampleSimple node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MotionctrlSampleSimple node handle the 'noise_shape' parameter when generating motion sequences?",
        "answer": "In the MotionctrlSampleSimple node, the 'noise_shape' parameter is used to generate a random tensor 'randt' based on the provided shape dimensions. This random tensor is then used in the sampling process to create variations in the generated motion sequences."
