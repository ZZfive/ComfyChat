        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSize node is designed to extract and provide the dimensions of an input image, specifically its width and height, which is crucial for understanding the spatial attributes of images in image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSize node requires an 'image' input, which is the image whose dimensions are to be determined. This input significantly affects the node's output, deciding the values of width and height to be calculated and returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSize node outputs two values: 'width' and 'height'. The 'width' represents the horizontal extent of the input image, and the 'height' represents the vertical extent of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' output of the ImageSize node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output of the ImageSize node represents the spatial extent of the input image along its horizontal axis, which is fundamental information for further image analysis and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'height' output of the ImageSize node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'height' output of the ImageSize node represents the spatial extent of the input image along its vertical axis. This measurement is crucial for understanding the layout of images and for subsequent image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' specified for the ImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' specified for the ImageSize node is CPU, indicating that the node is designed to run on a computer's central processing unit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the ImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the ImageSize node defines a class 'ImageSize' with methods to initialize the node, specify input and output types, and a 'main' function that takes an image tensor as input and returns its width and height."
