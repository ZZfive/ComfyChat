        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'text_string' method in the WAS_Text_String class?",
        "answer": "The 'text_string' method is designed to process and tokenize input strings, replacing predefined and custom tokens with their corresponding values, which plays a key role in dynamic text generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_String class?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it is the primary input that will be tokenized and processed. It influences the execution by establishing the base text where tokens will be replaced with actual values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_output' parameter represent in the WAS_Text_String class?",
        "answer": "The 'text_output' parameter represents the processed text after token replacement. It is significant as it reflects the result of the text operations and tokenization process performed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Text_String class handle additional text inputs like 'text_b', 'text_c', and 'text_d'?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_String class allows for more complex token replacement and text manipulation by using optional parameters 'text_b', 'text_c', and 'text_d'. These parameters enhance the flexibility of the node's functionality by enabling it to handle multiple text inputs for more intricate tokenization tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Text_String class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_String class uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'text_string' method process the input text?",
        "answer": "The 'text_string' method processes the input text by using the TextTokens class to parse and tokenize the text, replacing predefined and custom tokens with their corresponding values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types of the WAS_Text_String class?",
        "answer": "The return types of the WAS_Text_String class are (TEXT_TYPE, TEXT_TYPE, TEXT_TYPE, TEXT_TYPE)."
