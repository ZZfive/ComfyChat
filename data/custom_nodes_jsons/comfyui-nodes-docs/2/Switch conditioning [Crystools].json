        "question": "What is the purpose of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI-Crystools?",
        "answer": "The Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI-Crystools provides a mechanism to switch between two conditioning inputs based on a boolean value, effectively allowing conditional logic to be applied to the flow of conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Switch conditioning node are: on_true (CONDITIONING), on_false (CONDITIONING), and boolean (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Switch conditioning node is CONDITIONING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Switch conditioning node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean input is true in the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean input is true, the Switch conditioning node returns the on_true conditioning input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean input is false in the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean input is false, the Switch conditioning node returns the on_false conditioning input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI-Crystools?",
        "answer": "The category of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI-Crystools is 'crystools ðŸª›/Switch'."
