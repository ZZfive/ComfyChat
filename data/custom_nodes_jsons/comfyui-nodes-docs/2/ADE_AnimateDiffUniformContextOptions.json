        "question": "What is the purpose of LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode is designed to facilitate the creation of context options for uniform looping patterns in ComfyUI. It abstracts the complexity of setting context parameters and allows for simplified management of contexts within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'context_length' parameter in LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_length' parameter defines the length of the context window, which is crucial for determining the scope of data being processed. It plays an important role in the execution of the node by influencing the granularity of the context."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'context_stride' parameter affect the functioning of LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_stride' parameter determines the step size between consecutive context windows, which is vital for controlling the overlap and distribution of contexts. It affects how the node processes and organizes data within the contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'context_overlap' parameter in LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_overlap' parameter specifies the amount of overlap between adjacent context windows, which is important for ensuring continuity and minimizing gaps in data coverage. It is a key factor in the node's ability to maintain data integrity across contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'closed_loop' parameter indicate in LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'closed_loop' parameter indicates whether context processing should run in a closed loop, which is significant for establishing cyclic patterns in context processing. It influences the node's approach to managing repetitive context tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The output of LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode is represented as 'CONTEXT_OPTS', which stands for the configured context options generated by the node. It contains parameters and settings that will guide subsequent context processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode use?",
        "answer": "LegacyLoopedUniformContextOptionsNode uses the infra type 'CPU' for its operations."
