        "question": "What is the purpose of the HypernetworkLoader class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the HypernetworkLoader class is to conveniently load and integrate hypernetworks into existing neural network models, enhancing the model's capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter specifies the name of the hypernetwork to be loaded in the HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The 'hypernetwork_name' parameter specifies the name of the hypernetwork to be loaded in the HypernetworkLoader."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'strength' parameter in the HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'strength' parameter in the HypernetworkLoader is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter determines the influence of the hypernetwork on the model. It allows fine-tuning the intensity of the hypernetwork effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The output type of the HypernetworkLoader is the enhanced original neural network model, equipped to utilize the additional capabilities provided by the hypernetwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the HypernetworkLoader is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the HypernetworkLoader apply the hypernetwork patch to the model?",
        "answer": "The HypernetworkLoader applies the hypernetwork patch to the model by calling the 'set_model_attn1_patch' and 'set_model_attn2_patch' methods on the cloned model."
