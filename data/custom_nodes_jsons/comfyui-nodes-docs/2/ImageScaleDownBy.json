        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleDownBy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDownBy node is used to reduce the size of an image by a specified scale factor while maintaining the original image's aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScaleDownBy node are 'images', which represents the image to be scaled down, and 'scale_by', which specifies the scale factor by which the image will be reduced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is expected for the 'images' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node expects data of type IMAGE in ComfyUI and torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is expected for the 'scale_by' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_by' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node expects data of type FLOAT in ComfyUI and float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageScaleDownBy node is a resized version of the input image, with dimensions adjusted according to the 'scale_by' factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'scale_by' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'scale_by' parameter in the ImageScaleDownBy node is 0.5."
