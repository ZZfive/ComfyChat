        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptComposerGrouping node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerGrouping node in ComfyUI creatively processes text by adjusting the weight and structure of the input text to generate modified prompts for various AI applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PromptComposerGrouping node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the PromptComposerGrouping node is 'text_in', which is the basis for the node's operations. Its content and structure directly affect the output results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight' parameter do in the PromptComposerGrouping node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in the PromptComposerGrouping node fine-tunes the transformation applied to the input text, affecting the emphasis and presentation of the generated prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'active' flag influence the PromptComposerGrouping node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'active' flag in the PromptComposerGrouping node determines whether the node's processing is applied to the input text, thus controlling the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the PromptComposerGrouping node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the PromptComposerGrouping node is 'text_out', which contains the modified prompt ready for use in AI applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the PromptComposerGrouping node use?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerGrouping node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what happens if the 'text_in' is not empty, 'weight' is greater than 0, and 'active' is true?",
        "answer": "If the 'text_in' is not empty, 'weight' is greater than 0, and 'active' is true, the input text is processed using the applyWeight function with the given weight to produce the output prompt."
