        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceBBoxDetect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceBBoxDetect node in ComfyUI is designed to recognize and locate faces in images using a pretrained bounding box detector. It processes the input image to detect faces and refines the bounding box coordinates to ensure they are within the image boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the bbox_detector parameter in the FaceBBoxDetect node?",
        "answer": "The bbox_detector parameter is a pretrained model used to detect face bounding boxes in the input image. It is crucial for the node's functionality as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the face detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the threshold parameter do in the FaceBBoxDetect node?",
        "answer": "The threshold parameter sets the confidence level for face detection in the FaceBBoxDetect node. It influences the decision of whether to include the detected faces in the final results, thus affecting the precision of the detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the dilation parameter affect the detected bounding boxes in the FaceBBoxDetect node?",
        "answer": "The dilation parameter is used to adjust the size of the detected bounding boxes. It is important as it helps fine-tune the accuracy of the bounding box coordinates to better fit the actual size of the faces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FaceBBoxDetect node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FaceBBoxDetect node is a refined list of bounding boxes around the detected faces. It is important as it represents the direct result of the face detection process, providing valuable data for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the FaceBBoxDetect node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the FaceBBoxDetect node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the FaceBBoxDetect node do?",
        "answer": "The source code of the FaceBBoxDetect node initializes the class, defines the input and output types, and contains the main function that performs face detection using the pretrained bounding box detector. It also refines the bounding box coordinates and returns the results."
