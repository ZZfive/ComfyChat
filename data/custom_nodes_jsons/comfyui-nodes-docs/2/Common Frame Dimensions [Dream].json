        "question": "What is the purpose of the Common Frame Dimensions node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Common Frame Dimensions node in ComfyUI provides a utility to calculate frame dimensions based on input parameters such as size, aspect ratio, orientation, divisor, and alignment, abstracting the complexity of dimension calculations and alignment adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Common Frame Dimensions node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Common Frame Dimensions node are size, aspect_ratio, orientation, divisor, alignment, and alignment_type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'size' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node specifies the desired frame size from a predefined list of resolutions, which serves as the basis for further calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'aspect_ratio' input parameter affect the frame dimensions in the Common Frame Dimensions node?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect_ratio' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node determines the frame's width-to-height ratio, proportionally affecting its width and height to maintain the specified ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'divisor' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node?",
        "answer": "The 'divisor' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node is used to divide the frame size, allowing for finer control over the size granularity and affecting the final dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'alignment' input parameter specify in the Common Frame Dimensions node?",
        "answer": "The 'alignment' input parameter in the Common Frame Dimensions node specifies the alignment value for the dimension calculations, ensuring that the final dimensions align to a certain boundary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Common Frame Dimensions node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Common Frame Dimensions node are width, height, final_width, and final_height, which are the calculated dimensions considering all input parameters."
