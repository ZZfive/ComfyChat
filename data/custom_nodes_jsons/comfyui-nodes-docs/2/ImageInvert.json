        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageInvert node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageInvert node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a basic image processing operation, specifically inverting the colors of an image. It takes an image as input and outputs the corresponding image with inverted pixel intensities, reversing the light and dark areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of the image parameter for the ImageInvert node?",
        "answer": "The image parameter is crucial for the ImageInvert node because it is the main input that determines the object of the operation. The node processes this image to produce an inverted version, making the image parameter the core of the node's functionality and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inverted_image output represent in the ImageInvert node?",
        "answer": "The inverted_image output parameter represents the result of the image color inversion process. It is important because it is the direct output of the node's main function, presenting the transformed image with inverted pixel intensities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the ImageInvert node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the ImageInvert node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageInvert node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageInvert node in ComfyUI is 'image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageInvert node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageInvert node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the ImageInvert node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the ImageInvert node is IMAGE, represented as torch.Tensor in Python."
