        "question": "What are the required input types for the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GenerateReply node are 'recipient' (AGENT dtype in ComfyUI, ConversableAgent in Python) and 'message' (STRING dtype in ComfyUI, str in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'recipient' input in the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The 'recipient' input specifies the expected recipient agent of the message, which plays a key role in determining the context and content of the generated reply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'message' input in the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The 'message' input is the input message that the recipient agent is expected to reply to. This message sets the context for generating the reply."

    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the GenerateReply node is 'sender' (AGENT dtype in ComfyUI, ConversableAgent or None in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sender' input in the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The 'sender' input, if provided, identifies the sender of the message, which helps to more accurately tailor the reply within the conversational context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GenerateReply node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GenerateReply node is 'reply' (STRING dtype in ComfyUI, str in Python), which represents the generated reply from the recipient agent to the input message."
