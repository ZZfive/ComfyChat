        "question": "What is the purpose of the OtsuThreshold node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OtsuThreshold node in ComfyUI is used to separate the foreground and background of an image using the Otsu thresholding method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input data that the Otsu method is applied to?",
        "answer": "The primary input data that the Otsu method is applied to in the OtsuThreshold node is the input image that needs to be segmented."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the user specify the type of thresholding to be applied in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The user can specify the type of thresholding to be applied in the OtsuThreshold node using the 'threshold_type' input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gaussian_blur_x' parameter control in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'gaussian_blur_x' parameter in the OtsuThreshold node controls the width of the kernel used for the Gaussian blur. Higher values result in a stronger blurring effect, which helps reduce noise before thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'gaussian_blur_y' parameter relate to 'gaussian_blur_x' in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'gaussian_blur_y' parameter in the OtsuThreshold node defines the height of the kernel for the Gaussian blur. Together with 'gaussian_blur_x', it determines the extent of blurring applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gaussian_border_type' parameter control in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'gaussian_border_type' parameter in the OtsuThreshold node determines how the image borders are handled during the Gaussian blur process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the OtsuThreshold node after applying the Otsu thresholding method?",
        "answer": "The output of the OtsuThreshold node is the image with the Otsu thresholding applied, where the foreground and background have been separated."
