        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node in ComfyUI is used to apply a conditioned layered diffusion process to input data, allowing for fine-tuned control over the generation or transformation of data using specific configurations and weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node are: model (MODEL), cond (CONDITIONING), uncond (CONDITIONING), latent (LATENT), config (COMBO[STRING]), and weight (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cond' input represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node represents the conditioned input for the foreground, which guides the diffusion process to achieve specific visual effects or features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'uncond' input represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'uncond' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node represents the unconditional input for the background, providing a baseline for the diffusion process and influencing the overall output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'weight' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node is a factor that influences the strength and characteristics of the diffusion effect applied to the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node are: model (MODEL) and conditioning (CONDITIONING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'conditioning' represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node?",
        "answer": "The output 'conditioning' in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply node represents the conditioning information used in the diffusion process, indicating how the conditioned input influenced the output."
