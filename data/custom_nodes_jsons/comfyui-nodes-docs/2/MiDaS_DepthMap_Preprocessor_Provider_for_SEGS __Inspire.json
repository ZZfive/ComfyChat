        "question": "What is the purpose of the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node provides a specialized preprocessing function for the SEGS application, utilizing the MiDaS model to prepare depth maps. It adjusts depth map properties based on input parameters to optimize them for subsequent SEGS processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node are 'a' (a float value defining the scale factor for depth map adjustment) and 'bg_threshold' (a float value setting the threshold for background separation in the depth map)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter in the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node control?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node defines the scale factor for depth map adjustment, influencing the depth perception of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bg_threshold' parameter in the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node control?",
        "answer": "The 'bg_threshold' parameter in the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node sets the threshold for background separation in the depth map, helping to differentiate between foreground elements and the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'segs_preprocessor', which is an optimized depth map customized for the SEGS application, suitable for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is located in the 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' category within ComfyUI."
