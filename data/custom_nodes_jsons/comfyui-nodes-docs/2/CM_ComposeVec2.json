        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComposeVec2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec2 node is used to combine two scalar values into a single 2D vector, playing a key role in vector math."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'x' represent in the ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'x' represents the first component of a 2D vector, defining the horizontal position in the Cartesian coordinate system and contributing to the vector's overall direction and magnitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'y' represent in the ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'y' represents the second component of a 2D vector, indicating the vertical position in the coordinate system. It is crucial for establishing the vertical direction of the vector and, together with 'x', determines the vector's overall trajectory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ComposeVec2 node is a Vec2 object that encapsulates the provided 'x' and 'y' components into a coherent 2D vector, which can be used in a wide range of mathematical and geometric computations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output Vec2 object in the ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output Vec2 object in the ComposeVec2 node is 'VEC2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output Vec2 object in the ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output Vec2 object in the ComposeVec2 node is 'Vec2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ComposeVec2 node use?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec2 node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
