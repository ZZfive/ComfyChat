        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapBarrelDistortion node is used to adjust images for correcting barrel distortion or introducing barrel distortion effects. It allows manipulation of the image geometry to correct distortions usually caused by camera lenses or create specific visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of coefficient 'a' in the RemapBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'a' affects the extent of distortion applied to the image, playing a crucial role in the process of barrel distortion correction or introduction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the coefficient 'b' contribute to the distortion effect in the RemapBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'b' works with other coefficients to fine-tune the distortion effect, influencing the curvature of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of coefficient 'c' in the RemapBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'c' is another parameter for adjusting the distortion effect, contributing to the overall shape and intensity of the image transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_inverse_variant' parameter determine in the RemapBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_inverse_variant' parameter is a boolean that determines whether an alternative formula is used to calculate the distortion, affecting the final appearance of the remapped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional coefficient 'd' in the RemapBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The optional coefficient 'd' can be used to further adjust the distortion effect, providing additional control over the image transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the RemapBarrelDistortion node output?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapBarrelDistortion node is a transform map used to apply the barrel distortion effect to an image, which can be used for correction or introduction of distortion."
