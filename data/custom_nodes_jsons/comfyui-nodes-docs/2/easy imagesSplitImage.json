        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy imagesSplitImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy imagesSplitImage node is designed to split a single image tensor into multiple segments, dispersing the content of the original image into several new image tensors. This operation makes it easier to manipulate and analyze the image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the easy imagesSplitImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the easy imagesSplitImage node is 'images', which represents the input image tensor that needs to be divided into multiple parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the easy imagesSplitImage node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the easy imagesSplitImage node are 'image1', 'image2', 'image3', 'image4', and 'image5', representing the five segments of the split image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the easy imagesSplitImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the easy imagesSplitImage node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many segments does the easy imagesSplitImage node split the input image into?",
        "answer": "The easy imagesSplitImage node splits the input image into five segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the easy imagesSplitImage node?",
        "answer": "The category of the easy imagesSplitImage node is 'EasyUse/Image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python function is used to split the image in the easy imagesSplitImage node?",
        "answer": "The Python function used to split the image in the easy imagesSplitImage node is torch.chunk(), which splits the input image tensor along the first dimension."
