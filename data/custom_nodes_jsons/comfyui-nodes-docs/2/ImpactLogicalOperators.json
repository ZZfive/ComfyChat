        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactLogicalOperators node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node in ComfyUI is designed to perform logical operations on two boolean inputs, abstractly representing the basic concept of logical reasoning where the node processes inputs to produce a single boolean output based on the specified operator."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'operator' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'operator' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node determines the type of logical operation to be executed. It is crucial as it establishes the logical relationship between the two boolean inputs, influencing the execution of the node and the final output result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'bool_a' parameter play in the ImpactLogicalOperators node?",
        "answer": "The 'bool_a' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node represents the first boolean input for the logical operation. It is important as it constitutes half of the logical comparison or conjunction that the node is designed to evaluate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'bool_b' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node?",
        "answer": "The 'bool_b' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node is the second input for the logical operation. It is crucial as it complements the first boolean input 'bool_a' to complete the logical expression processed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' parameter in the ImpactLogicalOperators node is the boolean result of the logical operation executed by the node. It represents the final output obtained after evaluating the logical relationship between the two input boolean values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'doit' method of the ImpactLogicalOperators node function?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method of the ImpactLogicalOperators node functions by taking the 'operator' and two boolean inputs ('bool_a' and 'bool_b'), then performing the specified logical operation (AND, OR, XOR) on the inputs, and returning the resulting boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactLogicalOperators node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
