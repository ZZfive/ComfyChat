        "question": "What is KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "KfCurvesSubtract is a custom node in ComfyUI that is used to subtract one curve from another, resulting in a new curve that represents the difference between the original two curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main function of KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "The main function of KfCurvesSubtract is to subtract one curve from another, resulting in a new curve that represents the difference between the original two curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "The required input types for KfCurvesSubtract are curve_1 and curve_2, both of which are of type KEYFRAMED_CURVE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of curve_1 in KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "Curve_1 is the first input curve, and it serves as the baseline for the subtraction operation in KfCurvesSubtract. It is the central element in the process as it determines the form and structure of the resulting curve after the subtraction operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of curve_2 in KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "Curve_2 is the second input curve, representing the element to be subtracted from curve_1. It plays a crucial role in the subtraction process as it directly influences the outcome of the subtraction operation, determining the shape and characteristics of the resulting curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "The output of KfCurvesSubtract is the resulting curve, which is a single, refined curve that encapsulates the essence of the original two input curves, representing the difference between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected infrastructure type for KfCurvesSubtract?",
        "answer": "The expected infrastructure type for KfCurvesSubtract is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does KfCurvesSubtract subtract two curves in Python?",
        "answer": "KfCurvesSubtract subtracts two curves in Python using the `-` operator on the curves. The `-` operator performs element-wise subtraction between the corresponding points of the two curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `curve_1 = deepcopy(curve_1)` in the KfCurvesSubtract class?",
        "answer": "The purpose of `curve_1 = deepcopy(curve_1)` in the KfCurvesSubtract class is to create a copy of the curve_1 before it is modified by the subtraction operation. This ensures that the original curve is not changed by the subtraction operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `curve_2 = deepcopy(curve_2)` in the KfCurvesSubtract class?",
        "answer": "The purpose of `curve_2 = deepcopy(curve_2)` in the KfCurvesSubtract class is to create a copy of the curve_2 before it is modified by the subtraction operation. This ensures that the original curve is not changed by the subtraction operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the source code for KfCurvesSubtract be found?",
        "answer": "The source code for KfCurvesSubtract can be found at https://github.com/dmarx/ComfyUI-Keyframed."
