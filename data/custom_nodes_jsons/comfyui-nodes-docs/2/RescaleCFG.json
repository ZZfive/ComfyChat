        "question": "What is the purpose of the RescaleCFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RescaleCFG node is designed to modify the configuration of a model by applying a scaling factor to its parameters, with the aim of enhancing the model's performance or adapting it to different operating conditions without altering its basic architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RescaleCFG node are 'model', which defines the base model to be rescaled, and 'multiplier', which determines the degree of scaling to be applied to the model's configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiplier' parameter in the RescaleCFG node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter in the RescaleCFG node determines the extent of scaling to be applied to the model's configuration, directly influencing the final result of the rescaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RescaleCFG node is 'rescaled_model', which represents the model after the scaling process has been applied, signifying the new configuration of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for using the RescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the RescaleCFG node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RescaleCFG node modify the model's configuration?",
        "answer": "The RescaleCFG node modifies the model's configuration by applying a scaling factor to its parameters, which involves adjusting the model's sampler configuration function to incorporate the scaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rescale_cfg' function in the RescaleCFG node's source code do?",
        "answer": "The 'rescale_cfg' function in the RescaleCFG node's source code adjusts the model's sampler configuration by calculating a rescaled version of the input based on the original input, conditioned and unconditioned values, and the scaling factor, and then returns the modified input."
