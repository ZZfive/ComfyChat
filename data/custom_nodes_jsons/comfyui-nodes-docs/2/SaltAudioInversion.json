        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioInversion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioInversion node in ComfyUI is designed to invert the waveform of an audio file, achieving a phase reversal effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioInversion node requires an 'audio' input type, which accepts an audio file as the target for phase reversal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioInversion node is an audio file that has undergone phase reversal, where the phase of the original audio has been flipped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltAudioInversion node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltAudioInversion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltAudioInversion node in ComfyUI is SALT/Audio/Process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the SaltAudioInversion node is AUDIO."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert_audio' function in the SaltAudioInversion node do?",
        "answer": "The 'invert_audio' function in the SaltAudioInversion node inverts the waveform of the input audio by multiplying the array of samples by -1, spawning a new audio segment with the inverted samples."
