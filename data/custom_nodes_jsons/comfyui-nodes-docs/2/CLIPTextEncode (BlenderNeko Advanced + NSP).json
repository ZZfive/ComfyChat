        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncode node in ComfyUI is used to encode text input using an advanced CLIP model improved by BlenderNeko, with the option to dynamically manipulate text using Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP). It aims to provide more refined and context-aware text representations for downstream tasks such as image generation or text-based conditional control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPTextEncode node are: mode, noodle_key, seed, clip, token_normalization, weight_interpretation, and text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input determine in the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input determines the mode of text manipulation, such as using Noodle Soup Prompts for dynamic text changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noodle_key' input in the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'noodle_key' input is used to identify placeholders in the text that need to be dynamically replaced when using Noodle Soup Prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'token_normalization' input control in the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' input decides how tokens are normalized during the encoding process, affecting the representation's sensitivity to token frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CLIPTextEncode node are: conditioning, parsed_text, raw_text, and ui."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conditioning' output represent in the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' output represents the encoded text representation suitable for downstream tasks such as image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is displayed in the 'ui' output of the CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' output displays the user interface element showing the processed text, providing insight into how the text is interpreted and manipulated."
