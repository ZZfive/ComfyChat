        "question": "What is the purpose of the DilateErodeMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DilateErodeMask node in ComfyUI is used to modify mask images by dilating or eroding them based on the specified radius and shape. This process adjusts the boundaries of objects in the mask, which can enlarge or shrink them to achieve the desired morphological effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DilateErodeMask node are 'masks', 'radius', and 'shape'. 'masks' specifies the mask images to be processed, 'radius' determines the extent of the dilation or erosion effect, and 'shape' defines the shape of the structuring element used in the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius' parameter affect the dilation or erosion of mask images in the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "In the DilateErodeMask node, a positive 'radius' value will dilate the mask, expanding the object boundaries, while a negative 'radius' value will erode the mask, shrinking the boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'shape' parameter in the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'shape' parameter in the DilateErodeMask node are 'box' and 'circle', which define the shape of the structuring element used in the dilation or erosion process, affecting the nature of the morphological transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DilateErodeMask node is 'mask', which represents the modified mask image after applying the dilation or erosion operation, reflecting the adjusted boundaries of objects in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the DilateErodeMask node use?",
        "answer": "The DilateErodeMask node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dilate_mask' function in the DilateErodeMask node do?",
        "answer": "The 'dilate_mask' function in the DilateErodeMask node takes the input mask images, radius, and shape, and performs the dilation or erosion operation on the masks based on the specified parameters. It returns the modified mask image after applying the morphological transformation."
