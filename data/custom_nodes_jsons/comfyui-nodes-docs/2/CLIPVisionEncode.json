        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPVisionEncode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPVisionEncode node in ComfyUI is used to encode the visual information of an image into a format suitable for downstream tasks such as text-image matching or image classification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPVisionEncode node are 'clip_vision' (CLIP vision model) and 'image' (input image to be encoded)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip_vision' input in the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_vision' input in the CLIPVisionEncode node provides the CLIP vision model architecture and parameters necessary for encoding the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' input in the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the CLIPVisionEncode node is the raw data that will be transformed into a semantic representation by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPVisionEncode node is 'CLIP_VISION_OUTPUT', which includes the last hidden state, image embeddings, and the second-to-last hidden state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of the 'CLIP_VISION_OUTPUT' in the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'CLIP_VISION_OUTPUT' in the CLIPVisionEncode node is important as it provides the basis for further analysis or processing in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the CLIPVisionEncode node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CLIPVisionEncode node is GPU."
