        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node is designed to apply a gradient map to an input image, allowing for the creation of visually striking and diverse color effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What libraries does the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node utilize for processing images?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node uses the PIL library for image processing capabilities and the numpy library for array manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node are an input image and a gradient image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'flip_left_right' parameter do in the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node?",
        "answer": "The 'flip_left_right' parameter, when set to true, flips the input and gradient images left to right before processing, creating a mirror effect in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node is the generated image after the gradient mapping process, showing the brightness values of the input image converted to the gradient colors provided by the gradient image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Gradient_Map node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Filter' category in ComfyUI."
