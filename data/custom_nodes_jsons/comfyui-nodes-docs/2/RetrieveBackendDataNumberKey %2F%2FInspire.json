        "question": "What is the purpose of the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node is designed to extract numeric data from a backend service based on a provided key, allowing users to obtain specific information without the need for complex data processing procedures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'key' parameter in the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' parameter is crucial because it uniquely identifies the required data from the backend. It serves as the reference for the node to locate and retrieve the correct numeric value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the 'key' input in the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' input has a Comfy dtype of INT and a Python dtype of int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'data' output represent in the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' output represents the numeric value retrieved from the backend corresponding to the input 'key'. It is the direct result of the node's execution and holds significant value for further data analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the 'data' output in the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' output has a Comfy dtype of NUMBER and a Python dtype of Union[int, float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node requires a CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code for defining the input types of the RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The source code for defining the input types is as follows: ```class RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey(RetrieveBackendData): @classmethod def INPUT_TYPES(s): return {'required': {'key': ('INT', {'default': 0, 'min': 0, 'max': 18446744073709551615})}}```"
