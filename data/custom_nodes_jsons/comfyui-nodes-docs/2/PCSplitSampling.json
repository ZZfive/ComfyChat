        "question": "What is the purpose of the PCSplitSampling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PCSplitSampling node in ComfyUI is designed to modify a given model by enabling or disabling a specific sampling technique called prompt control split sampling. This technique is crucial for controlling the generation process of the model, allowing for more fine-grained and targeted outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the PCSplitSampling node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is essential in the PCSplitSampling node as it represents the machine learning model that will undergo adjustments in its sampling technique. It is the core component of the node's operation, and its modifications directly impact the model's generative capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'split_sampling' parameter in the PCSplitSampling node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'split_sampling' parameter in the PCSplitSampling node determines whether to enable the prompt control split sampling technique for the model. This toggle directly affects the model's method of sampling data and may be crucial for achieving specific results in the model's predictions or generations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the PCSplitSampling node?",
        "answer": "The output of the PCSplitSampling node is a modified version of the input model with the user-selected prompt control split sampling functionality applied. This allows the model to utilize the desired sampling behavior in subsequent tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the PCSplitSampling node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the PCSplitSampling node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PCSplitSampling node modify the input model?",
        "answer": "The PCSplitSampling node modifies the input model by cloning it and setting the 'pc_split_sampling' option in the model's options dictionary based on the user's choice of enabling or disabling the feature."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the PCSplitSampling node's 'apply' function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the PCSplitSampling node's 'apply' function is a tuple containing the modified model."
