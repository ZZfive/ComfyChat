        "question": "What is the purpose of the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FocalPointStylerAdvanced node is an advanced text prompt stylist that modifies and enhances text prompts using predefined style menus and style template datasets. Its purpose is to optimize the generation of images or text outputs by applying specific style adjustments, including modifications to both global and local text prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node include: text_positive_g (global positive text prompt), text_positive_l (local positive text prompt), text_negative (negative text prompt), focal point, negative_prompt_to (specifies the scope of negative prompt styling), and log_prompt (a boolean flag indicating whether to log input and output prompts for debugging or analysis)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_positive_g' input represent in the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "In the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node, the 'text_positive_g' input represents the global positive text prompt that will undergo style processing. Modifications to this prompt will influence the theme direction and visual features of the generated output globally."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node handle negative text prompts?",
        "answer": "The FocalPointStylerAdvanced node handles negative text prompts through the 'text_negative' input. This input specifies elements or themes that are not desired in the output. By modifying this prompt, the generation process can be fine-tuned by excluding specific characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'log_prompt' input in the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'log_prompt' input in the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node is a boolean flag that indicates whether to log input and output prompts for debugging or analysis purposes. Enabling this option provides insights into the styling process and its impact on the prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the FocalPointStylerAdvanced node include: text_positive_g (style-adjusted global positive text prompt), text_positive_l (style-adjusted local positive text prompt), text_positive (modified positive text prompt combining global and local adjustments), text_negative_g (adjusted global negative text prompt), text_negative_l (adjusted local negative text prompt), and text_negative (modified negative text prompt combining global and local adjustments)."
