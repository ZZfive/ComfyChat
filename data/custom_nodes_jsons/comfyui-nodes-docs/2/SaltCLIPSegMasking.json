        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltCLIPSegMasking node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node is designed for batch processing of images. It uses the CLIPSeg model to generate segmentation masks based on text descriptions, facilitating advanced image processing and analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltCLIPSegMasking node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SaltCLIPSegMasking node are a batch of images to be segmented and an optional text description to guide the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'clipseg_model' input in the SaltCLIPSegMasking node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'clipseg_model' input allows the user to provide a preloaded CLIPSeg model and processor for performing the segmentation task. If not provided, the node will load a default model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SaltCLIPSegMasking node?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node outputs segmentation masks corresponding to the input images, resized to the master image dimensions, as well as RGB representations of the segmentation masks for visualization purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the SaltCLIPSegMasking node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the SaltCLIPSegMasking node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltCLIPSegMasking node preprocess the input images?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node converts and resizes the input images to match the master image dimensions to ensure consistent mask generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'text' input in the SaltCLIPSegMasking node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input in the SaltCLIPSegMasking node is an optional text description that guides the segmentation process, allowing the generation of target masks based on textual clues."
