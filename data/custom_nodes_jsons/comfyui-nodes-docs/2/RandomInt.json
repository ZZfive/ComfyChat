        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomInt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node in ComfyUI generates a random integer within a specified range, providing a simple interface for obtaining integers that can be used for various applications such as random sampling or random processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RandomInt node?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node requires two input types: 'min' and 'max', both of which are of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int. 'min' specifies the minimum value of the range for generating the random integer, while 'max' defines the maximum value, ensuring the generated number does not exceed this value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the RandomInt node provide?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node provides two output types: 'int' and 'string'. 'int' is the randomly generated integer within the specified range, with Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int. 'string' is the string representation of the generated random integer, which is useful in scenarios that require text data, with Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type does the RandomInt node use?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node uses the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the RandomInt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the RandomInt node in ComfyUI is 'Art Venture/Utils'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the RandomInt node use to generate random integers?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node uses the 'random_int' function to generate random integers within the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RandomInt node determine if the generated value has changed?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node determines if the generated value has changed by using the 'IS_CHANGED' class method, which returns a random floating point number between 0 and 1 using 'torch.rand(1).item()'."
