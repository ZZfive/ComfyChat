        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskDominantRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskDominantRegion node in ComfyUI is used to identify and separate the dominant region in a given set of masks based on a specified threshold, effectively highlighting the most prominent areas in the image masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskDominantRegion node are 'masks', which are the input masks for dominant region detection, and 'threshold', which is the threshold value used to distinguish the dominant region in the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is a mask tensor that highlights the dominant region, which is important for applications that need to focus on or manipulate the main areas of the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is 128."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is 0, and the maximum value is 255."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the step size for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The step size for the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is GPU."
