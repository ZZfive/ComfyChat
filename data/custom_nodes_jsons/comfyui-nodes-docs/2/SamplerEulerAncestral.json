        "question": "What is the purpose of the SamplerEulerAncestral node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SamplerEulerAncestral node is designed to generate an ancestral sampler using the Euler method. It provides a customized way to generate samples that conform to a specific noise schedule, contributing to the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the eta parameter in the SamplerEulerAncestral node?",
        "answer": "The eta parameter is crucial for controlling the noise level in the sampling process. It directly affects the quality and convergence of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the s_noise parameter play in the SamplerEulerAncestral node?",
        "answer": "The s_noise parameter is essential for defining the initial noise level in the sampling process. It sets the starting point for noise reduction, influencing the overall sample generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SamplerEulerAncestral node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SamplerEulerAncestral node is a sampler, which is a key component in the sampling process. It encapsulates the logic for generating samples based on the provided noise schedule and parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SamplerEulerAncestral node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SamplerEulerAncestral node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the SamplerEulerAncestral node classified?",
        "answer": "The SamplerEulerAncestral node is classified under the 'sampling/custom_sampling/samplers' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the SamplerEulerAncestral node to create the sampler?",
        "answer": "The SamplerEulerAncestral node uses the 'get_sampler' function to create the sampler, which takes the eta and s_noise parameters as inputs."
