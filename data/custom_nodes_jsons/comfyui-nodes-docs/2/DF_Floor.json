        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Floor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Floor node in ComfyUI is designed to round down the input floating-point number to the nearest smaller integer. This operation is commonly known as 'flooring' a number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the DF_Floor node is 'Value', which represents the floating-point number to be rounded down. It is crucial for determining the node's output as it directly affects the flooring operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'Value' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'Value' input parameter is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'Value' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'Value' input parameter is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Floor node is 'int', which represents the nearest smaller integer value obtained after applying the flooring operation to the input floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output of the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the DF_Floor node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of the DF_Floor node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DF_Floor node is CPU."
