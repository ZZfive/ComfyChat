        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node is designed to process text input and generate encoded representations that can be used for further analysis or comparison. It plays a key role in the workflow, providing the basis for text-based feature extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node are 'clip', 'positive_text', and 'negative_text'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' parameter do in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node, as it provides the mechanism for encoding text. It is the core component that converts raw text into a structured format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'positive_text' parameter in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_text' parameter is a text input that is positively related to the encoding process. It is important because it sets the context for the encoding, influencing the final representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'negative_text' parameter in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "Similar to 'positive_text', the 'negative_text' parameter introduces a negative context to the encoding process. It is crucial for creating contrast in the encoded representation, which is beneficial for certain types of analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node are 'positive' and 'negative', both of which are of the 'CONDITIONING' data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive' output represent in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' output represents the encoded form of the positive text, serving as a reference for comparison or further processing within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'negative' output represent in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' output is the encoded representation of the negative text. When compared with the positive output, it can provide insight into the differences and nuances of the encoding process."
