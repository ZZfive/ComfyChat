        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetPhase node is designed to extract phase information from a sine curve, which is crucial for understanding the temporal positioning and location within oscillation patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node is 'curve', which defines the sinusoidal waveform from which the phase will be extracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype is used for the 'curve' input in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype used for the 'curve' input in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node is SINUSOIDAL_CURVE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is used for the 'curve' input in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype used for the 'curve' input in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node is keyframed.SinusoidalCurve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node produce?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetPhase node produces an output type called 'phase', which represents the temporal offset of the sine wave and is significant for aligning or comparing oscillation patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype and Python dtype are used for the 'phase' output in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype used for the 'phase' output in the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node is FLOAT, and the Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalGetPhase node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetPhase node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
