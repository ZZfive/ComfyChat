        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the visual depth and realism of images by applying an ambient occlusion effect. It intelligently calculates occlusion based on the input image's depth and color information, creating a more natural and immersive visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node are 'images' and 'depth_images'. The 'images' parameter provides the original visual data to which the ambient occlusion effect will be applied, while the 'depth_images' parameter supplies depth information that is crucial for accurately determining occlusion levels within the scene."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node allows users to control the intensity of the ambient occlusion effect. Adjusting this parameter can fine-tune the visual impact of the occlusion, making it more or less noticeable according to creative requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius' parameter affect the ambient occlusion calculation in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node defines the area around each pixel where the occlusion calculation is performed. A larger radius results in a more gradual and widespread occlusion effect, while a smaller radius creates a more localized and tighter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ao_blur' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The 'ao_blur' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node is responsible for the amount of blur applied to the occlusion image. It can smooth out the occlusion effect, creating a more subtle and natural appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'specular_threshold' parameter determine in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The 'specular_threshold' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node determines the cutoff value for specular highlights, affecting how the occlusion interacts with bright areas in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'enable_specular_masking' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'enable_specular_masking' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node allows selective application of the occlusion effect, bypassing areas of high specular reflection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'tile_size' parameter optimize the processing of ambient occlusion in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Ambient_Occlusion node optimizes the processing of ambient occlusion by dividing the image into multiple smaller chunks. This can enhance performance by allowing parallel processing, especially for larger images."
