        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec4BinaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4BinaryCondition node is designed to perform binary operations on four-component vectors. It applies a specified operation to two input vectors, producing a boolean result indicating the validity of the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'op' parameter in the Vec4BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter defines the binary condition to be applied to the input vectors. It is crucial for determining the nature of the comparison or operation performed, directly influencing the result of the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the Vec4BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the first vector in the binary operation. As a fundamental input, it plays a significant role in the execution of the node, influencing the final boolean result according to the condition specified by 'op'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'b' parameter in the Vec4BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter represents the second vector participating in the binary operation. It is essential for the node to calculate comparisons or operations together with 'a', and its value is crucial for the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'result' output in the Vec4BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output is a boolean value, representing the result of the binary condition applied to the input vectors. It indicates whether the condition specified by the 'op' parameter holds true for the given vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Vec4BinaryCondition node use?",
        "answer": "The Vec4BinaryCondition node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the binary condition operation performed in the source code of the Vec4BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the binary condition operation is performed using the VEC_BINARY_CONDITIONS dictionary, which maps the 'op' parameter to the corresponding operation. The operation is then applied to the input vectors 'a' and 'b' using numpy arrays."
