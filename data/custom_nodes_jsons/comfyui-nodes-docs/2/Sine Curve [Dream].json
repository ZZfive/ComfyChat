        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Sine Curve' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve' node in ComfyUI generates a sine wave based on animation frame data to create dynamic visual effects. It adjusts the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave through parameters such as maximum value, minimum value, periodicity, and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'frame_counter' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_counter' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node tracks the current time in seconds based on the animation's frame rate, serving as the basis for calculating the position of the sine wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'max_value' parameter affect the sine wave in the 'Sine Curve' node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node specifies the maximum amplitude of the sine wave, defining the peak value it can reach."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min_value' parameter determine in the 'Sine Curve' node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node determines the minimum amplitude of the sine wave, setting the lowest value it can descend to."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'periodicity_seconds' parameter influence the sine wave in the 'Sine Curve' node?",
        "answer": "The 'periodicity_seconds' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node controls the period of the sine wave, affecting the speed at which it completes a full cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'phase' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the 'Sine Curve' node adjusts the phase of the sine wave, altering its starting position within the cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the 'Sine Curve' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve' node outputs two types of data: FLOAT, which is the current frame's calculated sine wave value as a floating-point number, and INT, which is the sine wave value rounded to the nearest integer, suitable for discrete animations or effects."
