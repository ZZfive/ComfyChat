        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node in ComfyUI is designed for advanced text encoding using the CLIP model, allowing for custom token normalization and weight interpretation. It supports encoding multiple inputs simultaneously to generate a series of conditional constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node are: clip (CLIP model), token_normalization (boolean for token normalization), weight_interpretation (string for weight interpretation), and inputs_len (integer specifying the number of inputs to encode)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' input represent in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' input in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node represents the CLIP model used for encoding the input text into embedding vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'token_normalization' input affect the encoding process in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' input in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node determines whether tokens are normalized during the encoding process, which influences the final embedding vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'weight_interpretation' input in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_interpretation' input in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node adjusts the weight interpretation for the encoding, affecting how the embedding vectors are computed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' input specify in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' input in the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node specifies the number of inputs to be encoded, allowing the node to process multiple inputs simultaneously and generate a series of conditional constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node is 'conditioning', which represents a list of conditional constraints generated based on the encoded inputs."
