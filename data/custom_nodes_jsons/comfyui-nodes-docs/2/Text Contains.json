        "question": "What is the purpose of the `text_contains` method in the WAS_Text_Contains class?",
        "answer": "The `text_contains` method is designed to determine whether a specified substring exists within a larger text string. It does this by comparing the two strings and returning a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of the substring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Contains class?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter represents the larger text body within which the method will search for 'sub_text'. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it defines the scope of the search and directly influences the result of the method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'sub_text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Contains class?",
        "answer": "The 'sub_text' parameter is the specific string that the method will seek within the 'text' parameter. Its presence within the larger text is what the method aims to determine, making it a key input for the functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'case_insensitive' parameter do in the WAS_Text_Contains class?",
        "answer": "The 'case_insensitive' parameter determines whether the search for 'sub_text' within 'text' should ignore the case of the letters. This may be important for ensuring that the search is not hindered by differences in case."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output in the WAS_Text_Contains class indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output indicates whether or not 'sub_text' was found within 'text'. It is a binary indicator that provides a clear and concise answer to the question posed by the method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Text_Contains class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Contains class uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `text_contains` method handle case sensitivity in the WAS_Text_Contains class?",
        "answer": "If the 'case_insensitive' parameter is set to true, both 'sub_text' and 'text' are converted to lowercase before the search is performed, effectively ignoring case during the search."
