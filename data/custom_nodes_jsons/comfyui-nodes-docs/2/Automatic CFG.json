        "question": "What is the purpose of the Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI applies dynamic configuration to the model by adjusting parameters based on the 'boost' flag, aiming to enhance its performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Automatic CFG node are 'model' and 'boost'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter represents the model to which the dynamic configuration will be applied. It is essential for defining the basis for adjustments and optimizations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boost' flag in the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost' flag determines the intensity of the configuration adjustment. Enabling 'boost' applies more aggressive optimization strategies, which may significantly improve model performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Automatic CFG node is 'model', which is a modified version of the input model optimized through dynamic configuration adjustments to enhance performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the Automatic CFG node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what happens when the 'boost' flag is set to True?",
        "answer": "In the source code, when the 'boost' flag is set to True, it enables skipping uncond, sets uncond_sigma_start to 15, uncond_sigma_end to 1, and sets automatic_cfg to 'hard'."
