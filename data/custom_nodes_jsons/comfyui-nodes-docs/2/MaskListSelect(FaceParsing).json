        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskListSelect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskListSelect node is designed to select and manipulate specific elements from a series of masks. It operates on a tensor containing multiple masks and an index to identify the desired mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mask' parameter in the MaskListSelect node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is a tensor containing multiple masks. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it is the main data source for extracting the desired mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'index' parameter in the MaskListSelect node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is an integer that specifies the position of the mask to be selected from the tensor. It plays a key role in determining which mask will be extracted for further use, with a default value of 0 corresponding to the first mask in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskListSelect node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskListSelect node is a single mask tensor extracted from the input mask list. This output can be used for downstream tasks such as mask application, visualization, or further analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskListSelect node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskListSelect node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the MaskListSelect node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskListSelect node belongs to the 'face_parsing' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the MaskListSelect node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the MaskListSelect node is 'MASK', indicating that it outputs a single mask tensor."
