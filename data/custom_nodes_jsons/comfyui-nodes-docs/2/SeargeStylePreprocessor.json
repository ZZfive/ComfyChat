        "question": "What is the purpose of SeargeStylePreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SeargeStylePreprocessor is designed to handle and manipulate style-related inputs in the processing flow, ensuring that style information is correctly interpreted and prepared for subsequent stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SeargeStylePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SeargeStylePreprocessor are 'inputs', 'active_style_name', and 'style_definitions'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs' parameter in SeargeStylePreprocessor contain?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs' parameter in SeargeStylePreprocessor contains various inputs that are essential for the node to function properly and produce meaningful results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'active_style_name' parameter in SeargeStylePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'active_style_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the active style within the input set. It guides the preprocessing by specifying which style definitions should be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'style_definitions' parameter in SeargeStylePreprocessor contain?",
        "answer": "The 'style_definitions' parameter contains definitions of various styles that may be used during preprocessing. It is important for the node as it determines how styles are interpreted and transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of SeargeStylePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The output type of SeargeStylePreprocessor is 'inputs', which returns the processed input with correctly prepared and structured style information, allowing for seamless integration into the next stage of the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for SeargeStylePreprocessor?",
