        "question": "What is the purpose of the Frame Counter (Directory) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter (Directory) node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the number of frames based on the images found in a specified directory, matching a given pattern, and sorted in either numeric or alphabetic order. It is particularly useful in animation projects where tracking frame progress is necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Counter (Directory) node are: directory_path (STRING), pattern (STRING), indexing (COMBO[STRING]), total_frames (INT), and frames_per_second (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the directory_path input parameter function in the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The directory_path input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node specifies the directory path that contains the images to be counted. This path is crucial for locating and processing the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the pattern input parameter define in the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The pattern input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node defines the pattern used to match files in the directory (e.g., '*.jpg'). This pattern determines which files are included in the frame count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the indexing input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The indexing input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node decides the order of image indexing and counting, which can be either numeric order or alphabetic order. This affects the order of the frame count."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the total_frames input parameter affect the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The total_frames input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node sets the maximum number of frames to be counted, providing a limit for the frame counting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the frames_per_second input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node?",
        "answer": "The frames_per_second input parameter in the Frame Counter (Directory) node specifies the frame rate, which is used to calculate the duration of the animation based on the number of frames."
