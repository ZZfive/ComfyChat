        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node is designed to modify the phase of a sine wave, allowing for adjustments to the timing of the wave without altering its fundamental characteristics such as wavelength and amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node is the 'curve' parameter, which defines the base sine wave that will have its phase adjusted by the node operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'adjustment' parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node affect?",
        "answer": "The 'adjustment' parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node is a float value that affects the degree of phase shift applied to the input curve, influencing the timing of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node are 'curve' and 'sinusoidal_curve', both representing the phase-adjusted sine wave that can be further used in various applications requiring dynamic wave adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node modify the phase of the input sine wave?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node modifies the phase of the input sine wave by adding the 'adjustment' value to the phase of the input curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value and step size for the 'adjustment' parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'adjustment' parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustPhase node is 0.0, and the step size is 0.1308996939."
