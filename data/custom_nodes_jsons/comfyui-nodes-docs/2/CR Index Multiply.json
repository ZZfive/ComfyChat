        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_MultiplyIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_MultiplyIndex node is designed to perform multiplication operations on index values by a given factor, enhancing the functionality of index operations within workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_MultiplyIndex node are 'index' and 'factor', both of which are of the INT comfy dtype and int Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' parameter represent in the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter represents the base number that will be multiplied by the 'factor'. It plays a key role in determining the final output of the node as it serves as the starting point for the multiplication operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' parameter represent in the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter represents the multiplier that will be applied to the 'index'. It is crucial to the operation of the node as it determines the extent of the multiplication effect on the index value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_MultiplyIndex node are 'index', 'factor', and 'show_help'. The 'index' and 'factor' are of INT comfy dtype and int Python dtype, while 'show_help' is of STRING comfy dtype and str Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to documentation for additional guidance or help with using the node, serving as a useful resource for users seeking more information about node functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CR_MultiplyIndex node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CR_MultiplyIndex node is CPU."
