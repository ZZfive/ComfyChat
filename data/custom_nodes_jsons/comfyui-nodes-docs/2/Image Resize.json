        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Rescale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Rescale node in ComfyUI is designed to transform an image by scaling it according to a specified factor or resizing it to a set width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two main modes available in the WAS_Image_Rescale node for transforming images?",
        "answer": "The two main modes available in the WAS_Image_Rescale node for transforming images are 'rescale' and 'resize'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'supersample' parameter affect the image resizing process in the WAS_Image_Rescale node?",
        "answer": "When the 'supersample' parameter is set to 'true', it enables a higher quality resizing process by first scaling the image to a larger size and then resizing it down to the target size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rescale_factor' parameter define in the WAS_Image_Rescale node?",
        "answer": "The 'rescale_factor' parameter in the WAS_Image_Rescale node defines the scaling factor of the image. It is a multiplier that determines the extent of the image's size adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resize_width' parameter function in the WAS_Image_Rescale node?",
        "answer": "The 'resize_width' parameter in the WAS_Image_Rescale node sets the target width of the resized image. It is a crucial parameter that determines the new width of the image when the mode is set to 'resize'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'resampling' parameter in the WAS_Image_Rescale node?",
        "answer": "The 'resampling' parameter in the WAS_Image_Rescale node selects the filter used for resizing the image. Different filters can result in different outcomes in terms of image quality and sharpness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'scaled_image' represent in the WAS_Image_Rescale node?",
        "answer": "The output 'scaled_image' in the WAS_Image_Rescale node represents the transformed image after applying the scaling or resizing operation. It reflects the outcome of the node's intended function."
