        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_StarburstLines node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_StarburstLines node is designed to generate a visually appealing starburst pattern consisting of evenly distributed lines from a central point, allowing customization of various parameters such as the number of lines, line length, and color to create a unique and symmetrical design."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter determine in the CR_StarburstLines node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter determines the width of the generated image, which is crucial for setting the overall dimensions of the starburst pattern and ensuring it fits the desired canvas size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'num_lines' parameter affect the resulting starburst pattern in CR_StarburstLines?",
        "answer": "The 'num_lines' parameter determines the number of lines that will form the starburst, influencing the complexity and visual symmetry of the final pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'line_color_hex' parameter in CR_StarburstLines?",
        "answer": "The 'line_color_hex' parameter provides a hexadecimal color code for customizing the color of the starburst lines, allowing for more precise color selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_StarburstLines node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_StarburstLines node produces two output types: IMAGE, which contains the rendered starburst pattern as an image file, and show_help, which provides a link to documentation for additional information and guidance on using the CR_StarburstLines node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'rotation' parameter affect the starburst pattern in CR_StarburstLines?",
        "answer": "The 'rotation' parameter allows adjustment of the orientation of the starburst pattern by specifying a degree of rotation, providing control over the direction of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'background_color' parameter in CR_StarburstLines?",
        "answer": "The 'background_color' parameter sets the color of the canvas behind the starburst, providing a complementary background that enhances the visibility of the pattern."
