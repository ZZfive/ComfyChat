        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Get_latent_size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node is designed to calculate and return the size of a latent representation, which can be either the original size or the scaled size. It simplifies the complexity of handling latent data structures by providing a method to directly access its size attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Get_latent_size node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DF_Get_latent_size node are 'latent' and 'original'. 'latent' represents the data structure whose size needs to be calculated, and 'original' is a boolean parameter that determines whether to return the original size or the scaled size of the latent variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'original' parameter in the DF_Get_latent_size node do?",
        "answer": "The 'original' parameter in the DF_Get_latent_size node is a boolean that decides whether to return the original size or the scaled size of the latent variable. It affects the computation result by possibly altering the returned dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the DF_Get_latent_size node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the DF_Get_latent_size node are 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT', both of which are of Comfy dtype 'INT'. 'WIDTH' represents the width dimension of the latent variable size, and 'HEIGHT' represents the height dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the DF_Get_latent_size node use?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the DF_Get_latent_size node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node is classified in the 'Derfuu_Nodes/Functions' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute in the source code of the DF_Get_latent_size node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'FUNCTION' attribute in the source code of the DF_Get_latent_size node specifies 'get_size', indicating the method used to compute the size of the latent variable."
