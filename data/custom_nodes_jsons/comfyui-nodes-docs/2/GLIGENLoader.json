        "question": "What is the purpose of the GLIGENLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GLIGENLoader node is designed to efficiently load and process GLIGEN data. It plays a key role in the data preparation stage, ensuring that the correct GLIGEN data is retrieved and made available for subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'gligen_name' parameter in the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'gligen_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific GLIGEN data to be loaded. The node uses it to locate and retrieve the corresponding data file, which is then processed for use in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output of the GLIGENLoader node is the loaded and processed GLIGEN data. It represents the information obtained from the specified GLIGEN file and is ready for downstream tasks such as analysis or further data manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' for the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' for the GLIGENLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The GLIGENLoader node belongs to the 'loaders' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'load_gligen' function in the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'load_gligen' function in the GLIGENLoader node returns a tuple containing the loaded GLIGEN data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter type of 'gligen_name' in the GLIGENLoader node?",
        "answer": "The input parameter 'gligen_name' in the GLIGENLoader node is of type 'str' in both Comfy and Python."
