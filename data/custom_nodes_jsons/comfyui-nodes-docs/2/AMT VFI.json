        "question": "What is the primary function of the AMT_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AMT_VFI node is designed to perform video frame interpolation, enhancing the smoothness of transitions between frames and effectively increasing the frame rate of video sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific model configuration used for frame interpolation. It directs the node to the correct pre-trained model, ensuring the desired output quality and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frames' parameter represent in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter represents the input video frames that the node will process for interpolation. The quality and resolution of the input frames directly affect the final interpolated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter optimize memory usage in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter helps optimize memory usage by clearing the cache after processing a specified number of frames. This prevents memory overload during intensive frame interpolation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'multiplier' parameter in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter determines the number of intermediate frames generated between two existing frames. A higher value results in a higher frame rate for the output video but may also increase computational complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter allow in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter provides additional control over the frame interpolation process, allowing for customized interpolation behavior for specific frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interpolated_frames' output contain in the AMT_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolated_frames' output contains the original video frames along with the newly generated intermediate frames, resulting in a smoother and higher frame rate video sequence."
