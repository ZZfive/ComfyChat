        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy ckptNames node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy ckptNames node in ComfyUI is designed to simplify the process of selecting and managing checkpoint names in pipelines. It allows users to easily specify and retrieve the names of various checkpoints for use in model loading or other operations that require specific checkpoint identifiers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the easy ckptNames node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the easy ckptNames node is 'ckpt_name', which specifies the checkpoint name to be selected or managed. This parameter is crucial for determining which checkpoint to use in subsequent operations, directly affecting the execution and results of the node."

    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'ckpt_name' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'ckpt_name' input parameter is COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'ckpt_name' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'ckpt_name' input parameter is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the easy ckptNames node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the easy ckptNames node is 'ckpt_name', which returns the specified checkpoint name for further processing or model loading operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output 'ckpt_name' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output 'ckpt_name' parameter is *."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output 'ckpt_name' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output 'ckpt_name' parameter is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the easy ckptNames node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the easy ckptNames node is CPU."
