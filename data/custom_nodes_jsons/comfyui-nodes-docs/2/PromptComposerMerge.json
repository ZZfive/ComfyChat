        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptComposerMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerMerge node is designed to seamlessly integrate and merge two different text inputs into a single, coherent output. It is a crucial tool in applications that require combining textual information from different sources into a unified format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PromptComposerMerge node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PromptComposerMerge node are 'text_a' and 'text_b'. 'text_a' represents the first text input to be merged, while 'text_b' is the second text input that will be connected with 'text_a'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text_a' parameter in the PromptComposerMerge node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_a' parameter plays a crucial role in the operation of the PromptComposerMerge node, as it constitutes the initial part of the final output. The quality and content of 'text_a' significantly impact the overall coherence and context of the merged text."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'text_b' parameter mandatory in the PromptComposerMerge node?",
        "answer": "No, the 'text_b' parameter is not mandatory, but it is commonly used to add additional context or information to the merged text. Including 'text_b' can enhance the comprehensiveness of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the PromptComposerMerge node?",
        "answer": "The output of the PromptComposerMerge node is the 'text_out' parameter, which represents the merged output of the 'text_a' and 'text_b' inputs. It is the final result of the node's merging process, reflecting the consolidated textual information in a single, coherent format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the PromptComposerMerge node?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerMerge node requires a CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PromptComposerMerge node merge the two input texts?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerMerge node merges the two input texts by concatenating 'text_a' and 'text_b' with a comma and space in between, as shown in the source code: 'text_a + ', ' + text_b'."
