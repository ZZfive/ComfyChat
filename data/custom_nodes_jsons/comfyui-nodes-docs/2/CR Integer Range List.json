        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_IntegerRangeList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_IntegerRangeList node is designed to generate a list of integers within a specified range, with customizable start, end, and step parameters. It can also adapt to 'ping pong' behavior, reversing the range on alternating iterations for more varied output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' parameter define in the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter defines the beginning of the integer range. It is crucial as it determines the starting point of the generated sequence of numbers, influencing the overall output sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'end' parameter affect the output of the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'end' parameter specifies the end of the integer range. It is essential as it determines the last number in the generated sequence, thus affecting the length and span of the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'step' parameter play in the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter sets the increment between each integer in the range. It is important as it controls the spacing between numbers, affecting the density of the generated sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' parameter influence the output of the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter determines the number of times the range will be repeated or iterated. It is important as it affects the total number of numbers produced by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ping_pong' parameter introduce to the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'ping_pong' parameter introduces an alternating mode where the range is reversed on each iteration. It is important as it can introduce variability into the sequence, which may be necessary for certain applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INT' output provide in the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'INT' output provides a list of integer values generated based on the input parameters within the specified range. It is important as it represents the main output of the node, ready for further use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_IntegerRangeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to documentation for additional help. This is useful for users seeking extra information or guidance on how to effectively use the node."
