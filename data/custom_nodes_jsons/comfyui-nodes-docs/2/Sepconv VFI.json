        "question": "What is the purpose of the SepconvVFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SepconvVFI node in ComfyUI is designed to perform video frame interpolation using a separable convolutional neural network. It enhances the smoothness and fluidity of transitions between frames in a video sequence, helping to provide a higher quality visual experience without requiring extensive computational overhead."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the SepconvVFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter is crucial for loading pretrained model weights, which are essential for the frame interpolation process. It ensures that the model can generate accurate and high-quality interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter in the SepconvVFI node control?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter determines how often the GPU cache is cleared during the processing to maintain optimal performance. It is an optional setting that can help manage system resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter in the SepconvVFI node affect the interpolation process?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter influences the number of interpolated frames generated between two input frames. It is an optional parameter that allows the user to control the density of interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter in the SepconvVFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter provides additional control over the interpolation process, allowing for customization of interpolation states for each frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_frames' parameter in the SepconvVFI node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'output_frames' parameter contains the interpolated frames generated by the node. These frames are the result of the frame interpolation process and are crucial for creating smoother video transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the SepconvVFI node run?",
        "answer": "The SepconvVFI node runs on the GPU infrastructure type."
