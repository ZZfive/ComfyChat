        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWInteger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWInteger node in ComfyUI is designed to encapsulate an integer value, allowing integer data to be intuitively represented and manipulated within the computational graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the JWInteger node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the JWInteger node is 'value', which specifies the integer value to be encapsulated by the node. It is crucial for defining the node's behavior and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWInteger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWInteger node is 'int', which outputs the encapsulated integer value for further processing or use in the computational graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWInteger node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWInteger node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which common nodes are mentioned in the documentation for the JWInteger node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes mentioned in the documentation for the JWInteger node are CLIPTextEncodeSDXL, SVD_img2vid_Conditioning, Image Resize, and KSampler Adv. (Efficient)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWInteger node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWInteger node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWInteger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWInteger node in ComfyUI is 'jamesWalker55'."
