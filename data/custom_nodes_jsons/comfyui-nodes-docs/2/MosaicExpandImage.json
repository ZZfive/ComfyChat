        "question": "What is the purpose of the MosaicExpandImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MosaicExpandImage node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the visual appeal of an image by creating a mosaic effect around the image borders. It intelligently expands the image in a non-uniform, artistic way, resulting in an output that is visually striking while maintaining the integrity of the original image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MosaicExpandImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MosaicExpandImage node include the 'image' parameter, which represents the original image to be artistically expanded through the mosaic effect. This parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the base content to be transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'left' parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'left' parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node specifies the number of mosaic blocks to be added to the left side of the image. It plays a key role in determining the width of the left expansion area, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the final mosaic effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'top' parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'top' parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node determines the number of mosaic blocks to be added to the top of the image. It is important in shaping the height of the top expansion area, influencing the overall mosaic pattern created."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result_img' output parameter represent in the MosaicExpandImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'result_img' output parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node represents the final image after applying the mosaic expansion. It is the result of the node's processing, showcasing the artistic enhancement achieved through the mosaic effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' output parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output parameter in the MosaicExpandImage node provides a binary mask that delineates the original image area from the mosaic expanded area. It is crucial in applications where distinguishing between the original and expanded areas is necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MosaicExpandImage node handle the right-side expansion of the image?",
        "answer": "In the MosaicExpandImage node, if the 'right' parameter is greater than 0, the node crops a portion of the image based on the specified 'right' value, creates a mosaic from this portion, flips it horizontally, resizes it according to the new dimensions, and pastes it to the right side of the original image on the new canvas."
