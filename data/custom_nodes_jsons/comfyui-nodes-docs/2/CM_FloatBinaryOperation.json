        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI is designed to perform binary operations on floating-point numbers. It takes two inputs 'a' and 'b', applies the specified operation 'op' to produce a single floating-point result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'op' in the FloatBinaryOperation node specify?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'op' in the FloatBinaryOperation node specifies the binary operation to be performed on inputs 'a' and 'b'. It is crucial as it determines the mathematical function that will be applied to the inputs, directly affecting the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of parameter 'a' in the FloatBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'a' in the FloatBinaryOperation node is the first operand in the binary operation. It is a critical component of the input as it contributes to the final result when combined with the second operand 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of parameter 'b' in the FloatBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'b' in the FloatBinaryOperation node is the second operand in the binary operation. It plays an important role in the calculation as it combines with the first operand 'a' to produce the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'result' in the FloatBinaryOperation node represent?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'result' in the FloatBinaryOperation node represents the result of applying the binary operation 'op' to inputs 'a' and 'b'. It is a single floating-point number that contains the combined effect of the two operands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FloatBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FloatBinaryOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the FloatBinaryOperation node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the FloatBinaryOperation node defines the input and return types, the function to be performed, and the category of the node. It also includes the method 'op' which takes the parameters 'op', 'a', and 'b' and returns a tuple containing the result of the binary operation."
