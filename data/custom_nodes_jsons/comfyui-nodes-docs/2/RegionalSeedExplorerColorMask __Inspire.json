        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node is used to explore seed variations within specific regions defined by a color mask. It modifies the noise pattern based on seed prompts and additional seed information, allowing for targeted adjustments during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node are: color_mask (IMAGE), mask_color (STRING), noise (NOISE), seed_prompt (STRING), enable_additional (BOOLEAN), additional_seed (INT), additional_strength (FLOAT), and noise_mode (COMBO[STRING])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'color_mask' input represent in the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_mask' input represents the color mask that defines the region of interest for seed exploration. It determines where the seed variations will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'additional_seed' and 'additional_strength' inputs in the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'additional_seed' input allows for the inclusion of an additional seed value in the exploration process, providing further customization. The 'additional_strength' input determines the strength of the additional seed's influence on the exploration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node are: noise (NOISE) and mask (MASK)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'noise' output represent in the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' output represents the modified noise pattern after applying the seed variations and additional seed information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' output represent in the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output represents the original color mask used to define the target region, returned for reference or further processing."
