        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node in the ReActor framework?",
        "answer": "The ReActorFaceSwapOpt node provides optimized face swapping functionality with advanced options for fine-tuning the face swapping process in the ReActor framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'enabled' input in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'enabled' input determines whether to enable the face swapping operation, allowing users to switch the functionality on or off as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used as the main image for face swapping in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_image' is used as the main image input for the face swapping operation, serving as the target for face replacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'swap_model' input specify in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_model' input specifies the model to be used for face swapping, allowing selection from a predefined list of available models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'face_restore_model' input in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'face_restore_model' input allows the selection of a model for restoring face details after the face swap, enhancing the overall quality of the swapped face."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'codeformer_weight' input affect the face restoration process in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'codeformer_weight' input controls the influence of the CodeFormer model in the face restoration process, balancing detail enhancement and naturalness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'source_image' input in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'source_image' input is an optional secondary image input for face swapping, serving as the source of the face to be swapped into the main image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'face_model' output represent in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The 'face_model' output represents the facial model used in the face swapping process, which can be used for further operations or analysis."
