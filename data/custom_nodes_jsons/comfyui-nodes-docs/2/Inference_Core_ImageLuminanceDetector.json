        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is used to adjust the brightness of an image based on ControlNet preprocessing technology. It modifies the image brightness through gamma correction to enhance image quality or adjust the image for subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is 'image', which is the input image that needs brightness adjustment. Its Comfy dtype is IMAGE and Python dtype is numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types does the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node have?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node has two optional input types: 'gamma_correction', which specifies the gamma correction factor for adjusting image brightness, and 'resolution', which specifies the resolution of the output image, affecting the level of detail and size of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is 'image', which is an image with adjusted brightness through gamma correction processing. Its Comfy dtype is IMAGE and Python dtype is numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node use?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node classified?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is classified in the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is provided in the documentation. It shows the implementation of the ImageLuminanceDetector class, its input types, return types, function, category, and the execute method that performs the brightness adjustment using gamma correction."
