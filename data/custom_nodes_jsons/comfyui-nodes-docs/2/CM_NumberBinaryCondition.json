        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberBinaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberBinaryCondition node is designed to evaluate a binary condition between two numeric inputs. It performs a user-specified comparison operation and returns a boolean result indicating the outcome of the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the NumberBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the NumberBinaryCondition node are 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' defines the binary condition to be evaluated, 'a' represents the first number in the binary condition, and 'b' represents the second number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the NumberBinaryCondition node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the NumberBinaryCondition node specifies the binary condition to be evaluated. It determines the type of comparison performed between the two numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'a' and 'b' parameters in the NumberBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type for the 'a' and 'b' parameters in the NumberBinaryCondition node is 'number'. In Python, it is represented as Union[int, float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the NumberBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output of the NumberBinaryCondition node is a boolean value named 'result'. It provides the result of the binary condition evaluation, indicating whether the condition is true or false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the NumberBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the NumberBinaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the binary condition evaluation performed in the source code of the NumberBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the NumberBinaryCondition node, the binary condition evaluation is performed using the 'FLOAT_BINARY_CONDITIONS' dictionary. The specified 'op' is used as the key to retrieve the corresponding comparison function, which is then applied to the 'a' and 'b' values to obtain the boolean result."
