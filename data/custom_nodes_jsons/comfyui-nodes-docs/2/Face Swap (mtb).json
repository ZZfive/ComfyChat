        "content": "ComfyUI is a user interface designed for paper snapshots and other related uses. It is developed running on a stable diffusion model that could generate images and videos. A novel aspect of ComfyUI is that it allows users to create custom nodes or plugins. These custom nodes or plugins could extend the functionality of ComfyUI. ComfyUI keeps track of what project text content belongs to a particular node, app, or even android app, and combines all the data from AppSync Node, Android Node, or any of their siblings into a single version of the data in case of a conflict, and once data is added to the relevant sub downside, it guarantees nothing will remain the same until the latest data is added. termoLogGates Chain allows users to improveFlex connections. TermoGraphics renders different models and enables features like tag rendering. One can customize the screenshot compression of ComfyUI. ComfyUI also supports custom styling of vsync available on comunity. It is possible to extend ComfyUI to support NOM, which is a variant of video formats for videos of dynamic virtual ePNs. Additionally, an extension named `ComfyUI-Manager` is available, which provides improved diff handling.",
