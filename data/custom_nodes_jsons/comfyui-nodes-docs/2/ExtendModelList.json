        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendModelList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendModelList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple model lists into a single extended list, which is crucial for scenarios that require combining model lists to form a comprehensive collection for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ExtendModelList node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ExtendModelList node is inputs_len, which specifies the number of model lists to be merged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inputs_len parameter determine in the ExtendModelList node?",
        "answer": "The inputs_len parameter determines how many lists will be aggregated into the extended list in the ExtendModelList node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the inputs_len parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the inputs_len parameter is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the inputs_len parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the inputs_len parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ExtendModelList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ExtendModelList node is model, which represents the merged model list that aggregates all the input model lists into a single extended collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy and Python dtypes for the output model in the ExtendModelList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output model in the ExtendModelList node is MODEL, and the Python dtype is List[torch.nn.Module]."
