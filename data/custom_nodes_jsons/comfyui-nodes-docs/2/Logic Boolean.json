        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the WAS_Boolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean node is a fundamental component in logic operations, designed to process and return boolean values. It plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of workflows, ensuring that subsequent steps are executed based on the results of logical conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'boolean_number' parameter in the WAS_Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean_number' parameter is essential for determining the boolean result. It influences the execution of the node by providing a value rounded to the nearest integer, thus defining the boolean state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is accepted for the 'boolean_number' parameter in the WAS_Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean_number' parameter accepts a FLOAT data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to Union[float, int] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the WAS_Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output represents the boolean value derived from the input. It is important as it determines the flow of subsequent operations based on the evaluated logical condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'result' output in the WAS_Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output uses the INT data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to Tuple[int, int] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is specified for the WAS_Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean node specifies CPU as the infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the WAS_Boolean node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean node is classified under the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category in ComfyUI."
