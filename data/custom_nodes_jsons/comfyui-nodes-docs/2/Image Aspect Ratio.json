        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate and return various aspect ratio representations of an image. It determines whether an image is in landscape or portrait mode and provides common ratios in a simplified form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image), 'width' (Comfy dtype: NUMBER, Python dtype: int), and 'height' (Comfy dtype: NUMBER, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'aspect_number' output of the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect_number' output of the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node provides the raw numeric aspect ratio of the image, calculated as width divided by height (Comfy dtype: NUMBER, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'is_landscape_bool' output determined in the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The 'is_landscape_bool' output in the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node is a boolean value indicating whether the image is in landscape mode. It returns 1 for landscape and 0 for portrait or square aspect ratios (Comfy dtype: NUMBER, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'aspect_ratio_common' output of the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect_ratio_common' output of the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node represents the common aspect ratio of the image in a simplified form, such as '16:9', derived from the greatest common divisor of width and height (Comfy dtype: TEXT_TYPE, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'aspect_type' output in the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect_type' output in the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node describes the type of aspect ratio based on the calculated aspect ratio value. It can be 'landscape', 'portrait', or 'square' (Comfy dtype: TEXT_TYPE, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Image_Aspect_Ratio node is CPU."
