        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapFromInsideParabolas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromInsideParabolas node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a remapping operation from the perspective inside two parabolas, transforming the image according to the specified parabolic contours and dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RemapFromInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RemapFromInsideParabolas node are: src_mask_with_2_parabolas (a source mask containing two parabolas), width (the width of the output image after remapping), and height (the height of the output image after remapping)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the src_mask_with_2_parabolas input specify?",
        "answer": "The src_mask_with_2_parabolas input specifies a source mask that contains two parabolas, which is crucial for defining the geometric shape of the transformation and determining how the image will be remapped according to the parabolic contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the width and height inputs in the RemapFromInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The width and height inputs in the RemapFromInsideParabolas node define the dimensions of the output image after the remapping operation, allowing for adjustments to the aspect ratio of the transformed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemapFromInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemapFromInsideParabolas node is remap, which represents the result of the remapping operation: an image that has been transformed and aligned according to the specified parabolic contours and dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the RemapFromInsideParabolas node use?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromInsideParabolas node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the RemapFromInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the RemapFromInsideParabolas node is a Python class that inherits from RemapBase and defines the input types, output types, and the send_remap function, which uses the remap_from_inside_parabolas function from the .utils.remaps module to perform the remapping operation."
