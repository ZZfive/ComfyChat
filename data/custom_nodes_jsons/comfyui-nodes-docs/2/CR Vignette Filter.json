        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_VignetteFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_VignetteFilter node in ComfyUI is used to apply a visual effect called vignetting to images. This effect gradually darkens the corners of the image, creating a soft focus transition between the center area and the edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CR_VignetteFilter node are 'image', which is the input image to which the vignette effect will be applied, and 'vignette_shape', which determines the shape of the vignette to be applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'feather_amount' parameter control in the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'feather_amount' parameter in the CR_VignetteFilter node controls the softness of the vignette edges. A higher feather amount makes the transition from the dark corners to the image center more gradual, while a lower amount makes the transition more abrupt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the focus area of the image be adjusted using the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "The focus area of the image can be adjusted using the 'x_offset' and 'y_offset' parameters in the CR_VignetteFilter node. These parameters allow for horizontal and vertical adjustment of the vignette's center, respectively, changing the focal region within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'reverse' parameter in the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "When the 'reverse' parameter is set to 'yes' in the CR_VignetteFilter node, it inverts the vignette effect, darkening the center of the image instead of the edges, creating a contrasting visual style."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "The CR_VignetteFilter node outputs two types of data: 'IMAGE', which is the resulting image with the vignette effect applied, and 'MASK', which represents the transparency of the vignette as an alpha mask that can be used for further image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users access more information about using the CR_VignetteFilter node?",
        "answer": "Users can access more information about using the CR_VignetteFilter node through the 'show_help' output, which provides a documentation link for further guidance on the node's functionality and options."
