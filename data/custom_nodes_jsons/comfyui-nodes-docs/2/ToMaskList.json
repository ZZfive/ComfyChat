        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToMaskList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToMaskList node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a series of inputs into a mask list, playing a crucial role in organizing and preparing mask data for further processing or operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToMaskList node represents the input set that will be converted into a mask list. This parameter is essential for the node's operation as it directly influences the composition of the output mask list and determines the data available for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of 'inputs_len' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of 'inputs_len' is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of 'inputs_len'?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of 'inputs_len' is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToMaskList node is a mask list, structured to facilitate further operations involving mask data in the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output 'mask' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the output 'mask' is MASK."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output 'mask'?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the output 'mask' is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ToMaskList node is CPU."
