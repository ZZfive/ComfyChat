        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceDetailerPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceDetailerPipe node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the details of faces in images. It refines facial features and improves overall quality using advanced image processing techniques and models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the FaceDetailerPipe node are: image (the main data for facial refinement), detailer_pipe (a collection of models and parameters), guide_size (size of the guide image), and max_size (maximum size of the input image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the guide_size parameter determine in the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The guide_size parameter in the FaceDetailerPipe node determines the size of the guide image used for facial detailing. It is a key factor that influences the level of detail that can be achieved in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the FaceDetailerPipe node are: image (the enhanced image), cropped_refined (a series of refined facial images cropped from the enhanced image), and mask (a binary image depicting the enhanced facial areas)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the mask output in the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The mask output in the FaceDetailerPipe node is a binary image that depicts the enhanced facial areas. It is useful for isolating detailed regions for additional processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the FaceDetailerPipe node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the bbox_threshold parameter in the FaceDetailerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The bbox_threshold parameter in the FaceDetailerPipe node is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 that sets a threshold for the bounding box detection. It influences how the facial areas are detected and processed."
