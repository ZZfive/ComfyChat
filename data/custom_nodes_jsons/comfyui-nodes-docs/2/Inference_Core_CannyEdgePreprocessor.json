        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny Edge预处理器节点 in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny Edge预处理器节点 in ComfyUI is designed for image edge detection. It utilizes the Canny edge detection algorithm to highlight contours and edges in images, which is crucial for tasks requiring clear depiction of object boundaries, such as image segmentation or feature extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the Canny Edge预处理器节点?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'image', which is the input image that needs edge detection processing. The optional input types are 'low_threshold' and 'high_threshold', which control the detection of weak and strong edges respectively, and 'resolution', which determines the resolution the input image will be resized to before applying the Canny edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'low_threshold' parameter control in the Canny Edge预处理器节点?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' parameter in the Canny Edge预处理器节点 specifies the lower limit of the hysteresis thresholding step in the Canny edge detection algorithm, controlling the detection of weak edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'high_threshold' parameter define in the Canny Edge预处理器节点?",
        "answer": "The 'high_threshold' parameter in the Canny Edge预处理器节点 defines the upper limit of the hysteresis thresholding step, determining the detection of strong edges in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Canny Edge预处理器节点?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Canny Edge预处理器节点 is 'image', which is the image processed using the Canny edge detection technique, with edges highlighted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' specified for the Canny Edge预处理器节点?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' specified for the Canny Edge预处理器节点 is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Canny Edge预处理器节点 in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Canny Edge预处理器节点 in ComfyUI is 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors'."
