        "question": "What is the primary function of the CR_SplitString node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SplitString node is designed to split a given text string into multiple substrings based on a specified delimiter, simplifying the handling of complex text structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input parameters for the CR_SplitString node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the CR_SplitString node is 'text', which is the string to be split. The optional input parameter is 'delimiter', which defines the character or sequence of characters used to split the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'string_1' output of the CR_SplitString node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'string_1' output contains the first substring resulting from the split operation. It represents a portion of the original text and is a significant result of the node's function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_SplitString node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation page, offering additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many substrings can the CR_SplitString node output simultaneously?",
        "answer": "The CR_SplitString node can output up to four substrings simultaneously, labeled as 'string_1', 'string_2', 'string_3', and 'string_4'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the split operation results in fewer than four substrings in the CR_SplitString node?",
        "answer": "If the split operation results in fewer than four substrings, the CR_SplitString node pads the output with empty strings to ensure that four outputs are always returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'delimiter' parameter in the CR_SplitString node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'delimiter' parameter in the CR_SplitString node is a comma (',')."
