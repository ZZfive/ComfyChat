        "question": "What is the purpose of DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS is an image preprocessor designed specifically for segmentation tasks. It enhances input data by detecting various elements such as hands, bodies, and faces, and adjusting image resolution to achieve better segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The required input types for DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS include detect_hand, detect_body, detect_face, resolution_upscale_by, bbox_detector, and pose_estimator."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'detect_hand' input parameter affect the segmentation process?",
        "answer": "The 'detect_hand' input parameter enables or disables hand detection in the preprocessing step, which influences the focus and accuracy of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution_upscale_by' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution_upscale_by' input parameter adjusts the resolution of the input image by a specified upscaling factor, which improves the level of detail in the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bbox_detector' input parameter specify?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox_detector' input parameter specifies the boundary box detector model to be used, which affects the accuracy of element detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The output type of DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS is 'segs_preprocessor', which provides customized preprocessed input for segmentation tasks, including detected elements and resolution adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for running DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS is CPU."
