        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Lora_Loader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Loader node is designed to manage and apply Lora models to enhance the functionality of base models and clips. It optimizes performance and resource usage by caching previously loaded models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Lora_Loader node are: model (MODEL), clip (CLIP), lora_name (STRING), strength_model (FLOAT), and strength_clip (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength_model' parameter affect the output of the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength_model' parameter adjusts the intensity of the Lora model's influence on the base model. It plays an important role in fine-tuning the node's output to achieve the desired level of enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'NAME_STRING' output of the WAS_Lora_Loader node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'NAME_STRING' output provides the name of the loaded and applied Lora model. It serves as a reference to the specific Lora model used during the enhancement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Lora_Loader node optimize performance when loading Lora models?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Loader node optimizes performance by caching previously loaded models. If the requested Lora model has been loaded before, it retrieves the cached version instead of loading it again."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Lora_Loader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_Lora_Loader node are: MODEL (the enhanced model after applying the Lora model), CLIP (the modified clip component), and NAME_STRING (the name of the loaded and applied Lora model)."
