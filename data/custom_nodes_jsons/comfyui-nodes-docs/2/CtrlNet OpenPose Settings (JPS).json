        "question": "What is the purpose of the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node is designed to configure the settings of the OpenPose algorithm in the control network, allowing users to specify the source, strength, and whether to enable body, face, and hand estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node include openpose_from, openpose_strength, openpose_start, openpose_end, openpose_body, openpose_face, and openpose_hand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'openpose_from' parameter specify in the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'openpose_from' parameter specifies the source image for OpenPose estimation, allowing the user to choose between 'Source Image', 'Support Image', or 'Support Direct'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the strength of the OpenPose estimation controlled in the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node?",
        "answer": "The strength of the OpenPose estimation is controlled by the 'openpose_strength' parameter, which ranges from 0.00 to 10.00, allowing for fine-tuning of the pose estimation's influence on the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'openpose_body' parameter in the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node control?",
        "answer": "The 'openpose_body' parameter allows the user to enable or disable body estimation in the OpenPose algorithm, providing control over whether body pose data is included in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node is 'openpose_settings', which is a tuple that can be directly used in the control network's pose estimation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CtrlNet OpenPose Settings node is 'CPU'."
