        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADKeyframeNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADKeyframeNode class in ComfyUI is used to manage keyframes for animated diffs. It provides functionality to load and manipulate keyframes, ensuring the coherence and explicitness of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the start_percent parameter define in the ADKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The start_percent parameter defines the starting position of a keyframe on the animation timeline. It is crucial for determining the timing of the animation and ensuring the correct ordering of the keyframe sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the prev_ad_keyframes parameter contribute to the functionality of ADKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The prev_ad_keyframes parameter allows users to provide a set of previous keyframes to which the new keyframe will be added. This is essential for maintaining continuity and building upon an existing animation framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the scale_multival parameter in ADKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The scale_multival parameter adjusts the scaling of the animation at the keyframe. It is crucial for controlling the intensity and scope of the animation changes at specific points in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the effect_multival parameter influence the animation at a keyframe?",
        "answer": "The effect_multival parameter modifies the strength of the effect at the keyframe. It plays a vital role in fine-tuning the visual impact of the animation at specific moments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inherit_missing parameter determine in ADKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The inherit_missing parameter determines whether a keyframe should inherit properties from previous keyframes if they are not explicitly defined. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent animation style throughout the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the guarantee_steps parameter contribute to the smoothness of the animation?",
        "answer": "The guarantee_steps parameter ensures a minimum number of steps between keyframes, which is important for the smoothness and fluidity of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADKeyframeNode is a set of keyframes (AD_KEYFRAMES), representing the animation sequence with the newly added or modified keyframe. This output is essential for further processing and rendering of the animation."
