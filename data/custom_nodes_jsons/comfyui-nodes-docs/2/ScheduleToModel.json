        "question": "What is the purpose of the ScheduleToModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScheduleToModel node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically adjust a model's architecture based on a provided schedule, allowing seamless integration of different model configurations at specified steps to enhance the model's ability to generate responses that match the context at each step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ScheduleToModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ScheduleToModel node are 'model' and 'prompt_schedule'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the ScheduleToModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter represents the neural network that will be modified according to the prompt schedule. It is crucial as it serves as the basis for the node's operation, and its structure directly affects the results of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prompt_schedule' parameter define in the ScheduleToModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt_schedule' parameter defines the sequence of model adjustments that will occur at each step of the sampling process. It is essential for guiding the node's operation and determining the specific modifications to be applied at each step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ScheduleToModel node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ScheduleToModel node is 'model', which represents the modified neural network after the scheduled adjustments have been applied based on the prompt schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'model' of the ScheduleToModel node represent?",
        "answer": "The output 'model' represents the modified neural network that encapsulates the results of the node's operation, reflecting the dynamic changes applied during the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the ScheduleToModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the ScheduleToModel node is GPU."
