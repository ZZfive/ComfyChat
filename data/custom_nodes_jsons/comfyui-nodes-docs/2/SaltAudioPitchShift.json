        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioPitchShift node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioPitchShift node in ComfyUI is used to apply pitch shifting to the input audio by specifying the number of semitones, allowing the perceived pitch of the sound to be adjusted without changing the playback speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioPitchShift node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioPitchShift node are 'audio' (the audio input to be pitch-shifted) and 'semitones' (the number of semitones to shift the pitch, with positive values increasing the pitch and negative values decreasing it)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'semitones' input parameter in the SaltAudioPitchShift node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'semitones' input parameter in the SaltAudioPitchShift node represents the number of semitones by which the pitch of the input audio should be shifted, with positive values increasing the pitch and negative values decreasing it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioPitchShift node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioPitchShift node is 'audio', which represents the pitch-shifted output audio after applying the specified number of semitones."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the SaltAudioPitchShift node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioPitchShift node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltAudioPitchShift node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltAudioPitchShift node in ComfyUI is 'SALT/Audio/Effect'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioPitchShift node apply pitch shifting to the input audio?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioPitchShift node applies pitch shifting to the input audio using the 'ffmpeg' command with the audio filter (af) settings 'asetrate=44100*2^(semitones/12),aresample=44100', where 'semitones' is the specified number of semitones for pitch shifting."
