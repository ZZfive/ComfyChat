        "question": "What is the purpose of the Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node is designed to process optical flow data, preparing it for further processing or analysis, specifically within the context of the Unimatch system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Unimatch system?",
        "answer": "Unimatch is a system designed for estimating and manipulating optical flow in video sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node are an image sequence for processing, the checkpoint file name for the Unimatch model, and boolean flags for backward_flow and bidirectional_flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'backward_flow' input parameter do?",
        "answer": "The 'backward_flow' input parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether to estimate backward optical flow, enabling analysis of bidirectional motion between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bidirectional_flow' input parameter do?",
        "answer": "The 'bidirectional_flow' input parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether to estimate bidirectional flow, enhancing motion analysis by considering both forward and backward motion between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node are OPTICAL_FLOW, which is the preprocessed optical flow data, and PREVIEW_IMAGE, which is a visual representation of the optical flow data for previewing or debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the PREVIEW_IMAGE output?",
        "answer": "The PREVIEW_IMAGE output provides a visualization of the optical flow data, helping to understand the characteristics of the flow and verify the effectiveness of the preprocessing."
