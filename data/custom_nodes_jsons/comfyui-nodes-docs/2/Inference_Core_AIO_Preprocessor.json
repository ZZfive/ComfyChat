    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is the 'image' parameter, which represents the visual data to be preprocessed. This input is crucial for tailoring the preprocessing steps according to the specific features and requirements of the image, ensuring optimal preparation for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'preprocessor' parameter in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'preprocessor' parameter in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node specifies the specific preprocessing technique to be applied to the input image. This selection allows for customization of the preprocessing workflow to accommodate various needs and improve the effectiveness of data preparation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node defines the desired resolution of the output image after preprocessing. Adjusting this parameter allows control over the output quality and size to meet specific requirements of subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is the 'image' output, which represents the preprocessed image, now optimized and ready for further analysis or processing. This output is crucial for ensuring that the visual data is in the correct format and state for efficient and effective subsequent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node belong?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors' category in ComfyUI."
