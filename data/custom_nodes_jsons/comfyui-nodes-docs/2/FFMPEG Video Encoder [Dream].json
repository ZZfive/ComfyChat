        "question": "What is the purpose of the FFMPEG Video Encoder node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FFMPEG Video Encoder node in ComfyUI is designed to encode a series of images into a video file using FFMPEG. It allows adjusting the frame rate, optionally deleting source images after encoding, and handles file naming to avoid overwriting, making it convenient to create video content from individual frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FFMPEG Video Encoder node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FFMPEG Video Encoder node are: sequence (ANIMATION_SEQUENCE), name (STRING), framerate_factor (FLOAT), and remove_images (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sequence' input represent in the FFMPEG Video Encoder node?",
        "answer": "The 'sequence' input represents the sequence of images to be encoded into a video. It is crucial for defining the content and order of frames in the final video output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'name' input specify in the FFMPEG Video Encoder node?",
        "answer": "The 'name' input specifies the base name for the output video file, which can be further adjusted to avoid file name conflicts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'framerate_factor' input affect the resulting video in the FFMPEG Video Encoder node?",
        "answer": "The 'framerate_factor' input is a multiplier for the sequence frame rate, allowing adjustment of the speed of the resulting video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'remove_images' input determine in the FFMPEG Video Encoder node?",
        "answer": "The 'remove_images' input determines whether to delete the source images after encoding, which helps manage disk space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the FFMPEG Video Encoder node provide?",
        "answer": "The FFMPEG Video Encoder node provides a 'log_entry' output type, which is a detailed log entry recording the encoding process and results, including any errors encountered."
