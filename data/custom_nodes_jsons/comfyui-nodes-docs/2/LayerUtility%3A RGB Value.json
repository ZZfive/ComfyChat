            "question": "What is cp-scale?",
            "answer": "cp-scale is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for scaling images or crops, architectures, patches, and pixels. It can perform simple scaling or rotation operations on a wide range of models."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does cp-scale work?",
            "answer": "cp-scale works by accepting one input parameter, 'scale', which can either be a floating-point value or a character string. The 'scale' value is then used to scale or rotate the input image or crop, with a default value of 96 for scaling and 1 for rotation. This node is versatile, allowing users to customize scaling factors or rotation angles as needed."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is cp-scale applicable to all models?",
            "answer": "cp-scale is generally applicable to a variety of models, including but not limited to GPT-3 similar models, CPU/GPU models, and certain types of diffusion models. However, it's important to note that the performance and accuracy of cp-scale may vary depending on the specific model and its implementation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the advantages of using cp-scale?",
            "answer": "The main advantages of using cp-scale include its ability to improve the quality of images or crops by performing scaling or rotation operations without the need for additional hardware, its flexibility in scaling factors and rotation angles, and its compatibility with various models. Additionally, its easy-to-use interface makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced users."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does cp-scale support custom scaling factors?",
            "answer": "Yes, cp-scale supports custom scaling factors. Users can input a floating-point value for the 'scale' parameter to set the exact scaling factor of the image or crop. For example, setting the scale to 0.5 will result in a scale factor of 50%, effectively reducing the size of the input image or crop."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can cp-scale perform rotation operations?",
            "answer": "Yes, cp-scale can perform rotation operations. By setting the 'scale' parameter to 0 and the 'angle' parameter to a floating-point value, users can rotate the input image or crop. For example, setting the 'angle' parameter to 90 will rotate the input image or crop by 90 degrees clockwise."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the difference between cp-scale and a regular crop?",
            "answer": "The main difference between cp-scale and a regular crop lies in their functionality. CP-scale is designed to scale or rotate the input image or crop, while a regular crop is used to extract a portion of the image or crop for further processing. Additionally, cp-scale allows for the scaling and rotation of the entire image or crop, while a regular crop only extracts a specific region."
