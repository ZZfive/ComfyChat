        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SetSwitchFromString node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetSwitchFromString node is designed to evaluate a given text input against a set of predefined string options to determine an integer value switch based on the match. It serves as a key decision component in workflows, allowing for conditional branching or triggering specific actions based on the input string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'text' parameter in the CR_SetSwitchFromString node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is the input text that the node compares against. It is crucial for the switch options provided and plays a key role in determining the node's output as the matching process is central to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'switch_1' parameter function in the CR_SetSwitchFromString node?",
        "answer": "The 'switch_1' parameter represents one of the switch options that the node can match with the input text. It is part of the decision process and influences the result based on the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'switch' output in the CR_SetSwitchFromString node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'switch' output represents the integer value determined by the node after comparing the input text with the provided switch options. It signifies the result of the node's decision process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_SetSwitchFromString node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation page, offering free guidance and information for users seeking to understand the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_SetSwitchFromString node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetSwitchFromString node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_SetSwitchFromString node determine the value of the 'switch' output?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetSwitchFromString node determines the value of the 'switch' output by comparing the input 'text' with the provided 'switch_1', 'switch_2', 'switch_3', and 'switch_4' parameters. If a match is found, the corresponding integer value (1, 2, 3, or 4) is assigned to the 'switch' output."
