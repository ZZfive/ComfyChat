        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Canny_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Canny_Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to apply the Canny edge detection algorithm to input images, enhancing the visibility of edges in the image data."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Canny_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Canny_Filter node are 'images', which is the input image data, 'enable_threshold', which determines whether to apply thresholding, 'threshold_low', which sets the lower threshold for edge detection, and 'threshold_high', which sets the upper threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'enable_threshold' parameter in the WAS_Canny_Filter node control?",
        "answer": "The 'enable_threshold' parameter in the WAS_Canny_Filter node determines whether thresholding is applied in the Canny algorithm, which is important for controlling the sensitivity of edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Canny_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Canny_Filter node is 'images', which contains the processed images with edges highlighted using the Canny filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Canny_Filter node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Canny_Filter node uses CPU as the infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Canny_Filter node determine the strength of edges in the image?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Canny_Filter node determines the strength of edges by comparing the gradient magnitude of each pixel to the lower and upper thresholds set by the 'threshold_low' and 'threshold_high' parameters. Pixels with gradient magnitudes below the lower threshold are suppressed, while those above the upper threshold are considered strong edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny_detector function in the WAS_Canny_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Canny_detector function in the WAS_Canny_Filter node processes each input image to identify and highlight important edges through a multi-stage algorithm that includes Gaussian blurring, gradient calculation, and thresholding."
