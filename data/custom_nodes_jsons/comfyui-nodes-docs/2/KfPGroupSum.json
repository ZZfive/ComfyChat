        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfPGroupSum node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfPGroupSum node is designed to aggregate keyframed curves into a single composite curve. It operates by summing the individual curves associated with a given parameter group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the key input for the KfPGroupSum node?",
        "answer": "The key input for the KfPGroupSum node is the parameter group. It contains the set of keyframed curves to be summed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the parameter group input?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the parameter group input is PARAMETER_GROUP."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the parameter group input?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the parameter group input is Dict[str, kf.Curve]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the KfPGroupSum node output?",
        "answer": "The KfPGroupSum node outputs a composite keyframed curve that is the sum of all input curves in the parameter group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output of the KfPGroupSum node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the KfPGroupSum node is KEYFRAMED_CURVE."
