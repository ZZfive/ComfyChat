        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendIntList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendIntList node is designed to concatenate multiple integer lists into a single extended list, which is particularly useful in scenarios where integer data from different sources needs to be summarized for seamless data manipulation and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ExtendIntList node is 'inputs_len', which specifies the number of integer lists to be concatenated. This parameter determines how many lists will be merged into the extended list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ExtendIntList node is INT."

        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ExtendIntList node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ExtendIntList node is 'int', which represents the concatenated integer list formed by summarizing all input lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output of the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the ExtendIntList node is INT."

    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of the ExtendIntList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of the ExtendIntList node is List[int]."
