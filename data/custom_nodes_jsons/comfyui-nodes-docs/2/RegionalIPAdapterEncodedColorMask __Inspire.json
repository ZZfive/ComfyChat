        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node is used for applying regional image processing adaptations based on encoded color masks. It combines specific color-based mask regions with embedding adjustments to allow targeted image modifications while respecting user-defined spatial and color-based constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'color_mask' input used for in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_mask' input is used to define the adaptation areas using a color mask image. It serves as a spatial guide to determine where the adaptation should be applied based on color matching."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_color' input specify in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_color' input specifies a color string that is used to identify regions of interest within the color mask. This color acts as a keyword to isolate specific processing areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'embeds' input in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'embeds' input represents the desired adjustments or effects to be applied within the specified region. These embeddings guide the adaptation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'weight' input affect the adaptation process in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' input is a float value that determines the strength or influence of the embeddings on the adaptation process. It modulates the application intensity of the specified adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs control in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs are float values that indicate the starting and ending points for applying the adaptation. They allow for phased or gradual application and precise control over the modification range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'neg_embeds' optional input used for in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'neg_embeds' optional input represents negative adjustments or effects, providing a way to specify adaptations that should be avoided or counteracted within the region."
