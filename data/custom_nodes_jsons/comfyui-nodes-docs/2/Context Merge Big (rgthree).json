        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big (rgthree) node is designed to merge multiple context objects into a comprehensive context. It intelligently combines the inputs, ensuring that later contexts override earlier ones in case of overlap, thereby enabling seamless integration of context data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node are ctx_i, which represent the context objects to be merged. There can be multiple such inputs, each of which will be integrated into the final context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the optional input parameters for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the optional input parameters ctx_i for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node is RGTHREE_CONTEXT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node produce?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big (rgthree) node outputs a comprehensive context object (CONext), model information (MODEL), CLIP model information (CLIP), VAE model information (VAE), positive conditioning information (POSITIVE), negative conditioning information (NEGATIVE), latent space information (LATENT), image information (IMAGE), random seed value (SEED), step count information (STEPS), step refiner information (STEP_REFINER), CFG (configuration) information (CFG), checkpoint name (CKPT_NAME), sampler information (SAMPLER), scheduler information (SCHEDULER), CLIP width information (CLIP_WIDTH), CLIP height information (CLIP_HEIGHT), global positive text prompt (TEXT_POS_G), local positive text prompt (TEXT_POS_L), global negative text prompt (TEXT_NEG_G), local negative text prompt (TEXT_NEG_L), mask information (MASK), and ControlNet related information (CONTROL_NET)."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Merge Big (rgthree) node handle overlapping contexts?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big (rgthree) node handles overlapping contexts by ensuring that later contexts override earlier ones, enabling seamless integration of context data."
