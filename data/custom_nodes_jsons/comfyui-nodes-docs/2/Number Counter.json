        "question": "What is the function of the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_Counter node is designed to manage and operate numerical values. It effectively handles increment, decrement, and boundary control counting operations. This node is particularly suitable for applications requiring sequence generation or numerical adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_Counter node provides three output types: 'number', 'float', and 'int'. These outputs provide integer, float, and integer representations of the count value after operations, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start' parameter in the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter sets the initial value of the counter. This is a basic setting that sets the starting point for all counting operations the node performs. It allows counting to begin from a specific point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'step' parameter in the WAS_Number_Counter node affect?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter specifies the incremental or decremental value applied to the counter in each operation. It directly impacts the rate of change in the numerical sequence generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'stop' parameter in the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The 'stop' parameter defines the boundary value for counting operations. When this value is reached, the node will cease any increment or decrement counting based on the specified mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'reset_bool' parameter in the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The 'reset_bool' parameter, if set to a value of 1 or greater, allows the counter to be reset to its initial value. This provides a means to restart counting operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Number_Counter node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Number_Counter node are 'number_type', 'mode', 'start', 'stop', and 'step'. These parameters specify the type of numerical value handled by the node, the mode of counting operation, the initial value, the boundary value, and the step size respectively."
