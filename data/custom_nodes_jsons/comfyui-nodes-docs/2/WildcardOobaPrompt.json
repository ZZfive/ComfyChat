        "question": "What is the purpose of the WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically generate and process prompts for AI applications. It replaces wildcards in the input prompt with random selections and integrates with external APIs to generate detailed responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'input_prompt' parameter in the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_prompt' parameter is a string that contains the initial text of the prompt. It is crucial as it forms the basis for wildcard replacement and subsequent AI processing. This parameter directly affects the diversity and creativity of the final output generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter influence the functionality of the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is an integer used to initialize the random number generator during the wildcard replacement process. It ensures that the results are reproducible, which is essential for debugging and consistency testing of the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenario is the 'unique_id' parameter particularly important in the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is particularly important when managing multiple concurrent prompts. It allows the node to precisely locate and update the desired prompt by providing a unique identifier to reference specific entries within the prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' output parameter represent in the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' output parameter represents the final processed prompt after all wildcards have been replaced and the AI's responses have been integrated. It is a critical output as it directly feeds into the AI model, influencing the quality and characteristics of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the WildcardOobaPrompt node run on?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node runs on the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WildcardOobaPrompt node process the input prompt to generate the final output?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node processes the input prompt by first searching and replacing specific patterns using regular expressions. It then replaces wildcards with random choices, integrates with external APIs for further processing, and updates the prompt with the final output text."
