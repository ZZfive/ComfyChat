        "question": "What is the purpose of the Frame Counter Offset node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Offset node is used to modify the frame counter by applying a specified offset value. This adjustment allows for dynamic changes to the animation timeline, enabling the creation of shifted or delayed animation sequences based on the original frame count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Counter Offset node are 'frame_counter' and 'offset'. 'frame_counter' represents the current state of the animation frame count, while 'offset' specifies the number of frames the frame counter should be increased or decreased by."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Frame Counter Offset node is 'frame_counter', which is the modified frame counter that has been increased or decreased according to the specified offset, reflecting the new position in the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Frame Counter Offset node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Frame Counter Offset node belong?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Offset node belongs to the Animation category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'offset' parameter in the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'offset' parameter in the Frame Counter Offset node is -1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' function in the Frame Counter Offset node's source code do?",
        "answer": "The 'result' function in the Frame Counter Offset node's source code takes the 'frame_counter' and 'offset' as inputs and returns the modified frame counter after incrementing it by the specified offset value."
