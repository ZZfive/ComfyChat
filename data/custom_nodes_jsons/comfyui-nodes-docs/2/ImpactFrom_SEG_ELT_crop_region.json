        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'From_SEG_ELT_crop_region' node?",
        "answer": "The 'From_SEG_ELT_crop_region' node is designed to process specific regions of interest within a segmentation map. It focuses on extracting the coordinates that define the boundaries of that region, which is crucial for further analysis or manipulation within the ImpactPack toolkit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'crop_region' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_region' parameter is essential as it specifies the area within the segmentation map that needs to be cropped. It directly influences the operation of the node by determining the exact portion of the map that will be processed and returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'left' output parameter represent?",
        "answer": "The 'left' output parameter represents the left boundary coordinate of the cropped area. It is important as it provides one of the four fundamental coordinates required to define the location and extent of the cropped segment within the segmentation map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'top' output parameter represent?",
        "answer": "The 'top' output parameter represents the top boundary coordinate of the cropped area. Along with the other three parameters, it is crucial for determining the exact position and dimensions of the segment extracted from the segmentation map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'right' output parameter represent?",
        "answer": "The 'right' output parameter represents the right boundary coordinate of the cropped area. It is a key component in establishing the spatial boundaries of the segment within the segmentation map, ensuring that the correct portion is isolated for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bottom' output parameter represent?",
        "answer": "The 'bottom' output parameter represents the bottom boundary coordinate of the cropped area. Together with the 'left', 'top', and 'right' parameters, it forms the set of coordinates required to delineate the cropped segment within the segmentation map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the 'From_SEG_ELT_crop_region' node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the 'From_SEG_ELT_crop_region' node is CPU."
