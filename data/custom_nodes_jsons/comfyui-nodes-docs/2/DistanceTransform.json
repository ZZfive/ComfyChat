        "question": "What is the purpose of the DistanceTransform node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DistanceTransform node in ComfyUI is used to apply distance transformation to a binary image. It converts the binary image into a grayscale image, where the brightness of each pixel is proportional to its distance to the nearest binary foreground pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DistanceTransform node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DistanceTransform node are: binary_image (the binary image to be transformed), distance_type (specifies the type of distance calculation to use), and mask_size (determines the mask size used in the distance transformation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the distance_type input specify in the DistanceTransform node?",
        "answer": "The distance_type input in the DistanceTransform node specifies the type of distance calculation to use, allowing customization of the distance transformation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the mask_size input affect the distance transformation in the DistanceTransform node?",
        "answer": "The mask_size input in the DistanceTransform node determines the mask size used in the distance transformation, affecting the level of detail in the distance calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DistanceTransform node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DistanceTransform node is a grayscale image, where each pixel's brightness reflects its distance to the nearest foreground pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DistanceTransform node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DistanceTransform node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DistanceTransform node convert the binary image to a grayscale image?",
        "answer": "The DistanceTransform node converts the binary image to a grayscale image using the cv.distanceTransform function, which calculates the distance from each pixel to the nearest foreground pixel based on the specified distance type and mask size."
