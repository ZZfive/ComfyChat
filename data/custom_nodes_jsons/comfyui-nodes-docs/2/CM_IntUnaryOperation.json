        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntUnaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntUnaryOperation node is designed to perform various unary operations on integer inputs, providing a flexible and efficient way to manipulate numeric data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter specify in the IntUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter is crucial as it determines the specific unary operation to be applied to the integer input. It specifies the mathematical function to be used, affecting the execution of the node and the result of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the IntUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the integer input for the unary operation. Its value directly impacts the result of the operation as it is the operand to which all mathematical functions will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'result' represent in the IntUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'result' represents the outcome of applying the unary operation to the input integer. It encapsulates the transformed value after the operation, reflecting the primary function of the node - numeric manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the IntUnaryOperation node use?",
        "answer": "The IntUnaryOperation node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the op method in the IntUnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The op method in the IntUnaryOperation class takes the 'op' and 'a' parameters and returns a tuple containing the result of applying the specified unary operation to the input integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the IntUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The IntUnaryOperation node belongs to the 'math/int' category."
