        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node is designed to facilitate the debugging process by outputting image boundary information to the console. It enhances visibility during the image processing stage, assisting in analyzing and verifying image operation workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the image_bounds parameter in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node?",
        "answer": "The image_bounds parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it defines the region of interest within the image. It is used to identify and isolate specific parts of the image for further processing or analysis, thus playing a significant role in the execution of the node and the results it produces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the optional label parameter in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node?",
        "answer": "The label parameter serves as a descriptive identifier for the debug output. While not mandatory, it can be used to customize the console output, making it easier to distinguish between different debug messages, particularly useful in complex debugging scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node retains the input image boundary data, ensuring that the debug information accurately reflects in the console output. This parameter is important as it allows for the verification of image boundaries after node processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the label parameter in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the label parameter in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node is 'Debug to Console'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the debug_to_console function in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node do?",
        "answer": "The debug_to_console function in the WAS_Image_Bounds_to_Console node outputs the image boundary information to the console. It formats the output with a label and the image bounds, enhancing the visibility of the image processing stage for debugging purposes."
