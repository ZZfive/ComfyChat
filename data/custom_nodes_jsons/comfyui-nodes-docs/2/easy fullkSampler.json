        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'samplerFull' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'samplerFull' node in ComfyUI aims to provide a comprehensive sampling framework for generating high-quality images. It utilizes the power of advanced sampling techniques to create visually coherent and diverse outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'samplerFull' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'samplerFull' node are 'pipe', 'steps', and 'cfg'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node provides necessary data and settings for the sampling process, including model information, condition data, and configuration parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'steps' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node define?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node defines the number of iterations the sampling process will go through, which is a key factor in determining the refinement level of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cfg' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node adjust?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' parameter in the 'samplerFull' node adjusts the configuration settings of the sampling process, affecting aspects such as noise level and model behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'samplerFull' node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the 'samplerFull' node are 'pipe' and 'image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output of the 'samplerFull' node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output of the 'samplerFull' node represents the final image generated by the sampling process, reflecting the input parameters and settings."
