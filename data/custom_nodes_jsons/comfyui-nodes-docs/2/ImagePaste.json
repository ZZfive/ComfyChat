        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImagePaste node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly integrate a foreground image into a specified position on a background image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImagePaste node achieve transparency when pasting images?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node achieves transparency by converting the image's tensor representation to a PIL image and manipulating the alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImagePaste node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImagePaste node are background_image and foreground_image, both of which are of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does the ImagePaste node accept?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node accepts optional inputs x_position and y_position, both of which are of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int. These determine the exact placement of the foreground image on the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImagePaste node output?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node outputs the resulting image after the foreground has been pasted onto the background at the specified position. The output is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImagePaste node use?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImagePaste node handle images with less than 4 channels?",
        "answer": "If the foreground image does not have an alpha channel (i.e., it is not in 'RGBA' mode), the ImagePaste node converts it to 'RGBA' mode before pasting."
