        "question": "What is the purpose of the CCSR_Model_Select node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CCSR_Model_Select node is designed to select and load a specific CCSR model checkpoint based on the provided checkpoint name, providing pretrained weights for initializing the CCSR model for subsequent processing or inference tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the CCSR_Model_Select node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the CCSR_Model_Select node is 'ckpt_name', which is the name of the checkpoint to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for identifying and retrieving specific pretrained model weights from the available checkpoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CCSR_Model_Select node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CCSR_Model_Select node is 'ccsr_model', which represents the path of the loaded CCSR model checkpoint. This output is essential for subsequent nodes that require the model checkpoint path for initialization or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CCSR_Model_Select node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CCSR_Model_Select node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CCSR_Model_Select node?",
        "answer": "The category of the CCSR_Model_Select node is 'CCSR'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'load_ccsr_checkpoint' function in the CCSR_Model_Select node do?",
        "answer": "The 'load_ccsr_checkpoint' function in the CCSR_Model_Select node takes the 'ckpt_name' as input and returns the full path of the corresponding checkpoint, which is used to load the CCSR model checkpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names of the CCSR_Model_Select node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the CCSR_Model_Select node is 'CCSRMODEL', and the return name is 'ccsr_model'."
