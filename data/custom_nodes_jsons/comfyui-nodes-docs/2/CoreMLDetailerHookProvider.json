    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'mode' parameter in the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter specifies the resolution and aspect ratio for image processing. It is crucial because it determines how the CoreML model will handle the input images. The node uses this information to adjust the dimensions of the images to fit the model's requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'mode' parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'mode' parameter in Python is 'str' (string)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node is a CoreMLHook object, which is a dedicated hook designed specifically to work with CoreML models. It includes methods for preprocessing and postprocessing samples to ensure they are compatible with the model's expected input and output formats."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The category of the CoreMLDetailerHookProvider node is ImpactPack/Detailer."
