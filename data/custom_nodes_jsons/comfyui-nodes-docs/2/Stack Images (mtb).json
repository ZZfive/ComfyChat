        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI is a GUI that uses a stable diffusion model to generate images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI extend its functionality?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI extends its functionality through custom nodes or plugins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a 'custom node' mentioned in the documentation?",
        "answer": "A custom node in ComfyUI is a specialized plugin or extension that adds unique functionalities beyond its base capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between cg-noise and other custom nodes?",
        "answer": "Cg-noise is unique for its ability to replace KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "Cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`. "
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'x' in generating variations?",
        "answer": "The weight `x` in cg-noise determines the degree of variation applied to the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the seed impact the generated images?",
        "answer": "The seeds (`random_based_on(variation_seed)` and `random_based_on(seed)`) influence the initial randomness and specificity of the generated images."
