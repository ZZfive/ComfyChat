        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageUpscaleWithModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageUpscaleWithModel node is designed to enhance the resolution of input images using a specified upscaling model while intelligently managing system memory to prevent out-of-memory errors and ensure a smooth upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node are upscale_model, which defines the model used for upscaling the image, and image, which represents the input image data that the node will process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageUpscaleWithModel node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageUpscaleWithModel node is IMAGE, which represents the upscaled image generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageUpscaleWithModel node handle out-of-memory errors?",
        "answer": "The ImageUpscaleWithModel node handles out-of-memory errors by adjusting the tile size and retrying the upscaling process until it succeeds or the tile size becomes too small, in which case an exception is raised."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the upscale_model input parameter in the ImageUpscaleWithModel node?",
        "answer": "The upscale_model input parameter is crucial for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node as it defines the model used for upscaling the image, directly impacting the upscaling process and the quality of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the image input parameter in the ImageUpscaleWithModel node?",
        "answer": "The image input parameter is essential for the ImageUpscaleWithModel node as it represents the input image data that the node will process, with its structure and content being key to the success of the upscaling operation."
