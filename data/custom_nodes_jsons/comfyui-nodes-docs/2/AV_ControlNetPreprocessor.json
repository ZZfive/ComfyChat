        "question": "What is the purpose of the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node is designed to prepare images for further processing or analysis within the ControlNet framework. It allows applying various preprocessing techniques to the images, including resolution adjustment and selection of specific preprocessors, to optimize them to meet ControlNet's requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node are: an input image that needs preprocessing, a preprocessor that specifies the preprocessing technique to be applied, and the sd_version indicating the specific version of Stable Diffusion to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs can be provided to the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs that can be provided to the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node are: resolution, which is the desired resolution of the output image and can be adjusted based on specific quality or performance standards, and preprocessor_override, which allows overriding the initially selected preprocessor with an alternative one for added flexibility in preprocessor selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node are: IMAGE, which is the preprocessed image ready for further processing or analysis within the ControlNet framework, and CNET_NAME, which is the name of the ControlNet used or identified during the preprocessing process, providing context for subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an example of a common node that can be used with the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "An example of a common node that can be used with the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node is the CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the preprocessor_override input be used in the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The preprocessor_override input can be used in the AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node to override the initially selected preprocessor with an alternative one. If the specified override is not found in the available preprocessors, a warning is printed, and the originally selected preprocessor is used instead."
