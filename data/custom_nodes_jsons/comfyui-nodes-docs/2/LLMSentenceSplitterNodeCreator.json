        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node in ComfyUI is designed to split a given document into smaller, more manageable nodes along sentence boundaries, facilitating further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node is 'document' of Comfy dtype DOCUMENT and Python dtype str. The optional input types are 'chunk_size' and 'chunk_overlap', both of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'chunk_size' parameter control in the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node?",
        "answer": "The 'chunk_size' parameter in the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node specifies the maximum size of each chunk or node created from the document, allowing control over the granularity of the splitting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'chunk_overlap' parameter in the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node?",
        "answer": "The 'chunk_overlap' parameter in the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node determines the amount of overlap between consecutive chunks or nodes, ensuring continuity and context across splits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node is 'llm_nodes' of Comfy dtype LLM_NODES and Python dtype tuple, representing a collection of smaller, sentence-based nodes derived from the original document."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for running the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LLMSentenceSplitterNodeCreator node in ComfyUI is SALT/Language Toolkit/Tools."
