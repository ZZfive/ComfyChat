        "question": "What is the purpose of the BrownNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BrownNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to generate images with brown noise, a type of visual noise that simulates natural variations. It helps create random yet harmonious visual effects that can be used for various purposes such as visual effects or data augmentation in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter define in the BrownNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter in the BrownNoise node defines the width of the generated noise image. It is crucial for determining the dimensions of the output image and thus influences the overall visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'value_min' parameter affect the output of the BrownNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_min' parameter in the BrownNoise node allows setting the minimum intensity of the noise. It provides control over the lower limit of the noise values, affecting the overall darkness of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'red_min' parameter play in the BrownNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'red_min' parameter in the BrownNoise node specifies the minimum intensity of the red channel in the noise. It plays a role in adjusting the color balance of the output image, making it lean towards red hues."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'seed' parameter used in the BrownNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the BrownNoise node is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring the repeatability of the noise pattern. It is important for obtaining consistent results across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BrownNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BrownNoise node is IMAGE, which provides the generated brown noise image. It is important as it is the main result of the node's operation, containing the visual noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the BrownNoise node run?",
        "answer": "The BrownNoise node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
