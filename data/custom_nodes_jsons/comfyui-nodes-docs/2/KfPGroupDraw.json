        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfPGroupDraw node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfPGroupDraw node in ComfyUI is designed to visualize a group of parameter groups as curve graphs, allowing for the analysis of parameter changes over time or other variables."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'parameter_group' parameter in the KfPGroupDraw node?",
        "answer": "The 'parameter_group' parameter is crucial in the KfPGroupDraw node as it holds a collection of parameter groups whose dynamics will be visualized. It forms the basis of the node's operation, determining the data to be plotted and how the visualization represents the system's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'n' parameter in the KfPGroupDraw node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'n' parameter in the KfPGroupDraw node specifies the number of points at which the curve is evaluated. It affects the resolution of the plot, with higher values leading to a smoother representation of the parameter evolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'show_legend' parameter in the KfPGroupDraw node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_legend' parameter in the KfPGroupDraw node controls whether a legend is displayed in the plot. It is important for identifying different curves when visualizing multiple parameter groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'img_tensor' represent in the KfPGroupDraw node?",
        "answer": "The output 'img_tensor' in the KfPGroupDraw node is a tensor representing the image of the curve graph. It provides a visual summary of the parameter evolution over the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for running the KfPGroupDraw node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the KfPGroupDraw node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the KfPGroupDraw node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfPGroupDraw node falls under the 'experimental' category in ComfyUI."
