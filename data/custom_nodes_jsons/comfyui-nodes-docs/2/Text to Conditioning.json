        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node in ComfyUI is designed to convert text input into a conditioning format that can be used in generative models. It utilizes the capabilities of a text encoder to process the text and create a conditioning signal that can guide the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node are 'clip' and 'text'. The 'clip' parameter represents the contextual information that the text will be associated with, and the 'text' parameter provides the textual content to be encoded into the conditioning format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' parameter represent in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node represents the contextual information that the text will be associated with. It is crucial for the execution of the node as it forms the basis of the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node provides the textual content to be encoded into the conditioning format. Its importance lies in its direct influence on the output conditioning, which is used to guide the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node is 'encoded_conditioning'. It is a processed version of the input text, converted into a format suitable for use in conditional generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'encoded_conditioning' output represent in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The 'encoded_conditioning' output in the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node represents a processed version of the input text, encapsulating the semantic content of the text in a way that can be used by the model for generating output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Text_to_Conditioning node is CPU."
