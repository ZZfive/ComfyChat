        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI normalizes the pixel values of an image to the range of -1 to 1, adjusting the values to fit this scale. This is important for maintaining consistency in image processing tasks and preparing the data for models that require normalized inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node is 'images', which are the images that need to be normalized. The normalization process will adjust the pixel values to ensure they fall within the -1 to 1 range, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node is 'image', which represents the normalized image with pixel values adjusted to the -1 to 1 range. This normalization is essential for models that expect the input data to be normalized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI is 'KJNodes/misc'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'normalize' function in the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node do?",
        "answer": "The 'normalize' function in the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node multiplies the input images by 2.0 and then subtracts 1.0 from the result, effectively normalizing the pixel values to the range of -1 to 1."
