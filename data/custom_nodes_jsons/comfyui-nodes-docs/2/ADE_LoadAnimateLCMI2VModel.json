        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node is designed to load and prepare the AnimateLCM-I2V motion model for the animation process. It ensures that the selected motion model is compatible with the AnimateLCM-I2V format and contains an image encoder, thus facilitating the integration of the motion model into the animation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node is 'model_name', which specifies the name of the motion model to be loaded, ensuring that the model is available and compatible with the AnimateLCM-I2V format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node is 'ad_settings', which represents the optional settings for the Animate Diff process that can be applied to the motion model, allowing for customization of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node are 'MOTION_MODEL' and 'encoder_only'. 'MOTION_MODEL' is the loaded motion model ready for use in the animation process, and 'encoder_only' is a version of the motion model that contains only the encoder, suitable for specific animation tasks."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node in ComfyUI is 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/AnimateLCM-I2V'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return names of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node?",
        "answer": "The return names of the ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel node are 'MOTION_MODEL' and 'encoder_only'."
