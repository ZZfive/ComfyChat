        "question": "What is the purpose of the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node is used to preprocess images for depth map estimation using the Zoe Detector model. It adjusts the resolution of the input image and processes it through the model to generate a depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input required by the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The main input required by the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node is an image, which is used for depth map estimation. This is the primary input that the Zoe Detector model analyzes to generate the corresponding depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node is 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before processing. This parameter allows for standardizing the input size for consistent depth map estimation across different images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node is an image, specifically a depth map generated from the input image. The depth map provides a depth estimate for each pixel, aiding in understanding the spatial layout of the scene."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes that can be used with the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes that can be used with the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node are ControlNetApplyAdvanced and PreviewImage."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node generate depth maps?",
        "answer": "The Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node generates depth maps by using the Zoe Detector model. It adjusts the input image's resolution and processes it through the model to generate a depth map, which provides a depth estimate for each pixel in the image."
