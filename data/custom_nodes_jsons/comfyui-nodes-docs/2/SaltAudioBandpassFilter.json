        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBandpassFilter node in ComfyUI applies a bandpass filter to audio input, allowing specific frequencies within a range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside that range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node are: audio (the raw audio data to be processed), low_cutoff_frequency (the low frequency cutoff threshold), and high_cutoff_frequency (the high frequency cutoff threshold)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the low_cutoff_frequency input represent in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The low_cutoff_frequency input in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node represents the low frequency cutoff threshold. Frequencies below this value will be attenuated, helping to isolate the desired frequency band."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the high_cutoff_frequency input represent in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The high_cutoff_frequency input in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node represents the high frequency cutoff threshold. Frequencies above this value will be attenuated, further refining the isolation of the desired frequency band."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node is audio, which represents the processed audio data after applying the bandpass filter, allowing specified frequencies to pass through while attenuating others."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the apply_bandpass_filter method in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter class?",
        "answer": "The apply_bandpass_filter method in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter class takes the audio input, applies a low pass filter and a high pass filter based on the provided low_cutoff_frequency and high_cutoff_frequency, and returns the filtered audio data."
