        "question": "What is the purpose of the Equalize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Equalize node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the contrast of an image by adjusting its histogram. It improves the visual clarity and details of the image by dispersing the pixel intensity values, making the result clearer and more visually appealing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Equalize node is IMAGE. It provides the input image that will be processed by the node and directly affects the output, determining the quality and appearance of the enhanced image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the IMAGE input in the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the IMAGE input in the Equalize node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the IMAGE input in the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the IMAGE input in the Equalize node is PIL.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Equalize node is IMAGE, representing the processed version of the input with improved contrast and visual clarity. It is essential for subsequent image analysis or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the IMAGE output in the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the IMAGE output in the Equalize node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the IMAGE output in the Equalize node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the IMAGE output in the Equalize node is PIL.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Equalize node use?",
        "answer": "The Equalize node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
