        "question": "What is the purpose of the SoundReactive node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SoundReactive node in ComfyUI is designed to process audio input and adjust its behavior based on the sound level. It dynamically responds to changes in sound intensity within a specific frequency range and provides customization options through parameters such as sound level, frequency range, and normalization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SoundReactive node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SoundReactive node are: sound_level (FLOAT), start_range_hz (INT), end_range_hz (INT), multiplier (FLOAT), smoothing_factor (FLOAT), and normalize (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the start_range_hz parameter affect the SoundReactive node's sensitivity?",
        "answer": "The start_range_hz parameter defines the lower limit of the frequency range of interest. It helps focus the node's sensitivity on a specific part of the audio spectrum."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the multiplier parameter in the SoundReactive node?",
        "answer": "The multiplier parameter applies a scaling factor to the sound level, allowing for finer control over the node's responsiveness to audio input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the normalize parameter do in the SoundReactive node?",
        "answer": "The normalize parameter enables or disables the normalization of the sound level, which can standardize the input range to achieve consistent processing across different audio sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SoundReactive node?",
        "answer": "The SoundReactive node outputs two types: sound_level (FLOAT) and sound_level_int (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the sound_level_int output different from the sound_level output in the SoundReactive node?",
        "answer": "The sound_level_int output is an integer representation of the processed sound level, providing a simplified or quantized output for scenarios that require discrete levels."
