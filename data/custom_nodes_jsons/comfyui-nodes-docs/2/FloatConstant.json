        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatConstant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatConstant node in ComfyUI is designed to provide a constant floating-point value in data processing or machine learning workflows. It ensures that a consistent and predefined value is available for subsequent operations, helping with system performance stability and predictability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input parameter for the FloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the FloatConstant node is 'value'. It defines the specific floating-point number that will be outputted and plays a key role in the node's operation as it directly influences the result without requiring further computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'value' input parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'value' input parameter is of the FLOAT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'value' input parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the 'value' input parameter is of the float data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'value' represent in the FloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The output 'value' in the FloatConstant node represents the constant floating-point number provided by the node. It is important as it serves as a reliable and unchanging input for downstream processes in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FloatConstant node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FloatConstant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the FloatConstant node in ComfyUI is KJNodes/constants."
