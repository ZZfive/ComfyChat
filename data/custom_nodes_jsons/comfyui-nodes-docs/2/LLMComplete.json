        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMComplete node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMComplete node in ComfyUI is designed to generate text completions based on a given prompt using a specified language model. It abstracts the complexity of querying language models and allows for easy integration into larger systems that require natural language processing capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMComplete node are 'llm_model', which specifies the language model to be used for generating text completions, and 'prompt', which is the input text prompt that the language model uses to generate the completion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'llm_model' parameter determine in the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The 'llm_model' parameter in the LLMComplete node determines the language and knowledge capabilities of the generated text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'prompt' parameter in the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter in the LLMComplete node is crucial for guiding the model's output towards the desired context or question."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMComplete node is 'completion', which is the generated text completion based on the input prompt and the specified language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the LLMComplete node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMComplete node handle the 'documents' parameter in the 'complete' function?",
        "answer": "If the 'documents' parameter is not provided, the LLMComplete node generates a response using the language model with the given prompt. If 'documents' are provided, it filters for 'ImageDocument' types and generates a response using both the prompt and the image documents."
