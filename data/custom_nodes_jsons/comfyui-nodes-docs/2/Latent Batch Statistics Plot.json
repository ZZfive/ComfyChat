        "question": "What is the main purpose of the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node is to analyze the statistical properties of a batch of latent variables and generate a visual representation of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'batch' parameter in the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it represents the collection of latent variables to be analyzed, directly influencing the statistical analysis and the generated plot."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'plot_image' output represent in the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'plot_image' output is a graphical representation of the statistical analysis performed by the node, including p-values, means, and standard deviations of the latent batch, providing a visual summary of the data distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node determine the normality of each latent variable?",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node uses the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine the normality of each latent variable in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three statistical measures plotted by the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node?",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node plots three statistical measures: p-values from the Shapiro-Wilk test, means, and standard deviations of each latent variable in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What format is the output image of the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node?",
        "answer": "The output image of the LatentBatchStatisticsPlot node is in PNG format."
