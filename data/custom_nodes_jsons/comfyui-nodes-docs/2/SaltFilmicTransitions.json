        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltFilmicTransitions node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltFilmicTransitions node in ComfyUI is designed to create visually appealing transition effects between two sets of images, utilizing various modes such as sliding and circular expansion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SaltFilmicTransitions node are: images_a (the first set of images to transition from), images_b (the second set of images to transition to), mode (specifies the style of the transition), and transition_frames (the number of frames over which the transition occurs)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the SaltFilmicTransitions node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the SaltFilmicTransitions node specifies the style of the transition, such as the direction of the slide or circular expansion, defining the visual effect used to blend the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'transition_frames' parameter in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The 'transition_frames' parameter in the SaltFilmicTransitions node determines the number of frames over which the transition effect takes place, influencing the duration and smoothness of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input 'mask_blur_schedule' used for in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The optional input 'mask_blur_schedule' in the SaltFilmicTransitions node is used to control the intensity of blur during the transition process, allowing for finer visual adjustments to the transition effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltFilmicTransitions node is a set of images resulting from applying the transition effect, blended according to the specified mode and parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the SaltFilmicTransitions node is GPU."
