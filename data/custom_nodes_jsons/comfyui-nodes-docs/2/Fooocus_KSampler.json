        "question": "What is the purpose of the Fooocus_KSampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSampler node enhances the sampling process in art generation by introducing an adjustable sharpness parameter, allowing users to more precisely control the sharpness of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'model' input parameter in the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input parameter specifies the model used for the sampling process, serving as the basis for generating images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' input parameter affect the image generation process in the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' input parameter defines the number of steps to be performed during the sampling process, influencing the detail and quality of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'positive' and 'negative' input parameters in the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input parameter sets the positive conditioning guidance to steer the sampling towards desired attributes, while the 'negative' input parameter applies negative conditioning guidance to steer the sampling away from unwanted attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sharpness' optional input parameter function in the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpness' optional input parameter allows users to adjust the sharpness level of the generated images, providing a way to fine-tune the visual output according to artistic preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Fooocus_KSampler node is 'latent', which represents the generated image's latent representation that can be used for further processing or conversion to a visual format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type and common nodes for the Fooocus_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Fooocus_KSampler node is 'CPU', and the common nodes are listed as unknown."
