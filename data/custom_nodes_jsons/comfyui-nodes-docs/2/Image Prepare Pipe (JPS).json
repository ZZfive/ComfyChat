        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Prepare Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Prepare Pipe node in ComfyUI is designed to configure and apply various preprocessing steps to prepare images for further processing. This includes setting parameters for resizing, cropping, padding, interpolation, and sharpening to ensure optimal processing of the image in subsequent stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The Image Prepare Pipe node requires the 'imageprepare_settings' input, which specifies the settings for image preparation, including resizing, cropping, padding, interpolation, and sharpening. This configuration is crucial for customizing the image processing pipeline according to the specific requirements of the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'imageprepare_settings' input?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'imageprepare_settings' input is BASIC_PIPE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Image Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Image Prepare Pipe node include offset_width, offset_height, crop_left, crop_right, crop_top, crop_bottom, padding_left, padding_right, padding_top, padding_bottom, interpolation, and sharpening."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'offset_width' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'offset_width' output represents the horizontal offset applied during the image preparation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interpolation' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' output represents the interpolation method used when resizing the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Image Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Image Prepare Pipe node is CPU."
