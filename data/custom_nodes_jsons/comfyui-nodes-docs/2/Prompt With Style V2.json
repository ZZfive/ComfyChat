        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptWithStyleV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptWithStyleV2 node in ComfyUI is designed to generate and refine prompts with a specified style, ensuring that the generated content aligns with the desired artistic or thematic direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PromptWithStyleV2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PromptWithStyleV2 node are: positive_prompt, negative_prompt, style, ratio_selected, clip_base, and clip_refiner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'style' parameter in the PromptWithStyleV2 node define?",
        "answer": "The 'style' parameter in the PromptWithStyleV2 node is crucial for defining the aesthetic or thematic direction of the generated content, influencing the selection of artistic elements as well as the overall look and feel of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'clip_base' and 'clip_refiner' parameters in the PromptWithStyleV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_base' parameter is a reference to the base CLIP model used for encoding and decoding text prompts into latent space representations. The 'clip_refiner' parameter represents a refining CLIP model used to further enhance the quality and specificity of the generated prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the PromptWithStyleV2 node output?",
        "answer": "The PromptWithStyleV2 node outputs: samples, base_pos_cond, base_neg_cond, refiner_pos_cond, refiner_neg_cond, positive_prompt, and negative_prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PromptWithStyleV2 node ensure the repeatability of the generation process?",
        "answer": "The PromptWithStyleV2 node ensures the repeatability of the generation process through the use of the 'seed' parameter, which is particularly useful when consistent results are needed across multiple runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the PromptWithStyleV2 node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the PromptWithStyleV2 node is CPU."
