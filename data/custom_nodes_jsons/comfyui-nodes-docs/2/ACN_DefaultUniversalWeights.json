        "question": "What is the purpose of the DefaultWeights node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DefaultWeights node in ComfyUI is designed to initialize and return a set of default control weights and corresponding timestep keyframe groups, serving as the foundation for building control networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS output parameter represent?",
        "answer": "The CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS output parameter represents the default control weights of the network. It is a crucial element in shaping the behavior of the control network as it defines the initial weights that will be used in subsequent calculations and adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME output parameter?",
        "answer": "The TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME output parameter encapsulates the keyframe group associated with the control weights. It plays an important role in the time dynamics of the control network, providing a structured way to manage and apply weights over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DefaultWeights node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DefaultWeights node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DefaultWeights node?",
        "answer": "The category of the DefaultWeights node is Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types of the DefaultWeights node?",
        "answer": "The return types of the DefaultWeights node are CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS and TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the load_weights function in the DefaultWeights class do?",
        "answer": "The load_weights function in the DefaultWeights class initializes default control weights and returns them along with a default TimestepKeyframeGroup associated with these weights."
