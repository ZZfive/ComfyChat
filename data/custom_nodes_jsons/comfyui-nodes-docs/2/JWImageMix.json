        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageMix node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageMix node is designed to blend two images together using a specified blend mode and blend factor, supporting operations like blending and multiplication for flexible image processing and combination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageMix node are blend_type (specifying the blend mode), factor (determining the weight of the second image in the blend), image_a (the first image to be blended), and image_b (the second image to be blended)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blend_type parameter in the JWImageMix node specify?",
        "answer": "The blend_type parameter in the JWImageMix node specifies the blend mode used to mathematically combine the images, affecting the visual outcome of the blend."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the factor parameter influence the blending of images in the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The factor parameter in the JWImageMix node determines the weight of the second image in the blend. A higher factor makes the second image more prominent, while a lower factor favors the first image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two blend modes supported by the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The JWImageMix node supports two blend modes: 'mix' and 'multiply'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageMix node is an image, which is the result of blending the two input images according to the specified blend type and factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type should the JWImageMix node be run?",
        "answer": "The JWImageMix node should be run on the GPU infrastructure type."
