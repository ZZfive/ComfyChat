        "question": "What is the purpose of the VAEDecode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAEDecode node in ComfyUI is designed to convert latent representations back into the original data space. It utilizes the decoding capability of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct images from their encoded latent vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'samples' parameter in the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is a crucial input for the VAEDecode node as it provides the latent representations that the node will decode into images. The fidelity of these latent vectors largely determines the quality of the reconstructed images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae' parameter specify in the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter specifies the pre-trained Variational Autoencoder model that the node will use to decode the latent samples. It is a mandatory input because the node relies on the model's parameters and learned distributions to perform the decoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VAEDecode node is a reconstructed image generated from the decoded latent representation. This output is important as it demonstrates the node's ability to generate coherent images that reflect the input latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for using the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the VAEDecode node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The category of the VAEDecode node is 'latent'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the VAEDecode node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the VAEDecode node is not an output node. It is used to decode latent representations back into the original data space."
