        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Sequence Blend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Sequence Blend node in ComfyUI is used to enhance the visual transitions and continuity within an animation sequence by applying fade-in and fade-out effects over a specified number of iterations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Sequence Blend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Sequence Blend node are: animation sequence (ANIMATION_SEQUENCE), fade_in (FLOAT), fade_out (FLOAT), and iterations (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the fade_in parameter affect the animation sequence in the Image Sequence Blend node?",
        "answer": "The fade_in parameter in the Image Sequence Blend node specifies the intensity of the fade-in effect at the beginning of each frame transition, which influences the smoothness of the visual flow in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fade_out parameter control in the Image Sequence Blend node?",
        "answer": "The fade_out parameter in the Image Sequence Blend node determines the strength of the fade-out effect at the end of each frame transition, helping to seamlessly integrate consecutive frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the iterations parameter influence the output of the Image Sequence Blend node?",
        "answer": "The iterations parameter in the Image Sequence Blend node controls the number of times the blending process is applied, affecting the overall smoothness and continuity of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Sequence Blend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Sequence Blend node is an animation sequence (ANIMATION_SEQUENCE) with enhanced frame-to-frame visual transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Image Sequence Blend node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the Image Sequence Blend node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
