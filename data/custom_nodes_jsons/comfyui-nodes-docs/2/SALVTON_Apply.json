        "question": "What is the purpose of the SALVTON_Apply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SALVTON_Apply node in ComfyUI is designed to apply SAL-VTON (virtual try-on) technology, using deep learning models to achieve virtual overlay of clothing on character images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SALVTON_Apply node are the garment image, the person image, and the garment mask image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the garment image play in the virtual try-on process?",
        "answer": "The garment image is the clothing item that needs to be overlaid on the character image. It plays a key role in the virtual try-on process by providing the specific clothing item to be tried on."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the garment mask image in the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The garment mask image is used to accurately overlay the clothing onto the character image by defining the boundaries of the clothing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the SALVTON_Apply node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the SALVTON_Apply node is the resulting image after applying the virtual try-on processing, showing the realistic fitting effect of the clothing on the character."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the SALVTON_Apply node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the SALVTON_Apply node is an IMAGE, represented as a torch.Tensor in Python."
