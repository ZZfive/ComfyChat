        "question": "What is the purpose of the SegmDetectorForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SegmDetectorForEach node is designed to perform segmentation detection processing and analysis on images in ComfyUI. It applies a segmentation model to identify different regions in the image and follows specific detection confidence thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the segm_detector parameter in the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The segm_detector parameter is crucial for the operation of the SegmDetectorForEach node as it defines the segmentation model that will be used to analyze the input image. It plays a core role in the detection process, directly influencing the accuracy and quality of the segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the threshold parameter affect the segmentation detection in the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The threshold parameter controls the sensitivity of the segmentation model's detection. It determines the minimum confidence level required to consider a segment as detected, thus influencing the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the dilation parameter play in the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The dilation parameter is important for post-processing the detected segments. It controls the extent of morphological dilation applied to the segments, which helps refine boundaries and improve overall segmentation quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the labels parameter be used to filter detected segments in the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The labels parameter allows filtering the detected segments based on a specified list of segment types. It is particularly useful when the analysis needs to focus on specific segments of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the segs output parameter represent in the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The segs output parameter represents the segments detected from the input image. It is a collection of segmented regions, each with its own attributes and labels, providing a detailed analysis of the image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for running the SegmDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the SegmDetectorForEach node is GPU."
