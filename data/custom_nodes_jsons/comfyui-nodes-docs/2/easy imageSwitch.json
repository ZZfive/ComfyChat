        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageSwitch node in ComfyUI is designed to conditionally select between two images based on a boolean value. It is a fundamental component in image processing workflows for making decisions under certain conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the imageSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the imageSwitch node are image_a, image_b, and boolean. image_a and image_b are the two image options that the node may return, while the boolean input directly influences which of the two images will be output by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the boolean input determine in the imageSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The boolean input in the imageSwitch node is crucial for the decision process. It directly determines which of the two images, image_a or image_b, will be returned as the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the imageSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the imageSwitch node is selected_image, which represents the image selected based on the boolean input. It embodies the final result of the node's functionality, containing the outcome of the applied conditional logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the imageSwitch node operate?",
        "answer": "The imageSwitch node operates by evaluating the boolean input and then returning the corresponding image. If the boolean input is true, it returns image_a; otherwise, it returns image_b."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the imageSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the imageSwitch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the imageSwitch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageSwitch node belongs to the EasyUse/Logic/Switch category in ComfyUI."
