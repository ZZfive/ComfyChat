        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_Trigger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_Trigger node is designed to perform conditional checks to determine if a given index matches a specified trigger value. It plays a key role in controlling the flow of data and execution in systems, allowing for selective processing based on index conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'index' parameter in the CR_Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is crucial for the operation of the CR_Trigger node as it represents the current position or identifier in the sequence being evaluated. It is used to establish a condition which, when met, will trigger a response from the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'trigger_value' parameter define in the CR_Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger_value' parameter defines the specific value that the index must match for the node to consider the condition as satisfied. It is a key determining factor in the node's decision-making process and directly influences the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'index' output in the CR_Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' output reflects the current index value evaluated by the node. It is important as it provides a reference to the position in the sequence being checked."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'trigger' output in the CR_Trigger node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger' output is a boolean value indicating whether the index matches the trigger value. It is crucial for downstream processes that rely on knowing if the condition has been met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'show_help' output in the CR_Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, offering users a direct way to reference the node's usage guide and additional information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_Trigger node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_Trigger node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
