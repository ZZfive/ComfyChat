        "question": "What is the purpose of the IFUnet_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IFUnet_VFI node in ComfyUI is designed to perform video frame interpolation, enhancing the smoothness and continuity of video transitions by generating intermediate frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific model weights used for frame interpolation. It directs the node to the correct pre-trained model, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in the frame generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter influence the frame interpolation process in the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter determines the number of intermediate frames generated between consecutive frames. It is a key factor in controlling the density of interpolated frames, thereby controlling the smoothness of the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'scale_factor' parameter play in the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_factor' parameter adjusts the scaling ratio of input frames before processing. It is an important factor that can affect the detail and resolution of interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'ensemble' parameter contribute to the performance of the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ensemble' parameter enables an ensemble method to improve the stability and quality of interpolated frames. It is an optional feature that can enhance the node's performance under certain conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter in the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter is important for managing memory usage during the frame interpolation process. It helps maintain system performance by clearing the cache after processing a certain number of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_frames' parameter represent in the IFUnet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_frames' parameter represents the result of the frame interpolation process. It contains the original frames as well as the newly generated intermediate frames, enhancing the continuity and visual appeal of the video."
