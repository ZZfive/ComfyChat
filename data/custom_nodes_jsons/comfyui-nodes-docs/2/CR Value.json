        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_Value node in Comfyroll?",
        "answer": "The CR_Value node is designed to provide a versatile interface for converting input values into different data types, emphasizing flexibility and practicality in data manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'value' parameter in the CR_Value node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter is crucial as it serves as the primary input for the node's conversion process, being the source from which floating-point and integer representations are derived."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the 'FLOAT' output of the CR_Value node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'FLOAT' output provides a floating-point representation of the input value, which is useful for numerical calculations and analyses requiring precise decimal values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'INT' output of the CR_Value node simplify calculations?",
        "answer": "The 'INT' output provides an integer form of the input value, suitable for scenarios requiring only whole numbers, thereby simplifying calculations and reducing complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_Value node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, which is helpful for users seeking additional guidance or information about the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_Value node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_Value node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'get_value' function in the CR_Value node return?",
        "answer": "The 'get_value' function returns a tuple containing the float and integer representations of the input value, as well as a URL link to the node's documentation."
