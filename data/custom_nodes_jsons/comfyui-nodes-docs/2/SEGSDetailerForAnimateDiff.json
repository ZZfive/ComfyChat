        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance segmentation details in image frames, particularly suited for improving the quality of animated diffs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node include image_frames, segs, guide_size, guide_size_for, max_size, seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, denoise, and basic_pipe."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the guide_size parameter affect the detail enhancement process?",
        "answer": "The guide_size parameter sets the scaling factor for the detail enhancement process, determining the level of detail that will be introduced into the image segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the seed parameter ensure in the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter ensures reproducibility of results when running the node with the same seed value, as it is used for random number generation during the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the denoise parameter?",
        "answer": "The denoise parameter controls the level of denoising applied to the enhanced images, playing a crucial role in achieving a balance between detail and noise in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node are segs, which contain the enhanced segmentation details of the input image frames, and cnet_images, which provide a visual representation of the control net's influence on the detail enhancement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node handle optional input parameters?",
        "answer": "The SEGSDetailerForAnimateDiff node accepts optional input parameters such as refiner_ratio and refiner_basic_pipe_opt, which allow for further refinement and fine-tuning of the final output if provided."
