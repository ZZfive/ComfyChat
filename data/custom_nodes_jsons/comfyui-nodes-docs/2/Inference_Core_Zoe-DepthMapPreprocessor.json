        "question": "What is the purpose of the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to process images using the ZoeDepth model to estimate depth maps. It enhances the understanding of spatial relationships in images and can be used for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed for depth map estimation. The image will be processed by the ZoeDepth model to generate depth estimates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node is resolution, which specifies the desired output resolution of the depth map. It allows adjusting the level of detail of the depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node is an image, which is the depth map of the input image, providing per-pixel depth estimates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node belong?",
        "answer": "The Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/Normal and Depth Estimators category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node process the input image?",
        "answer": "The Zoe Depth Map Preprocessor node processes the input image using the ZoeDetector model. It calls the common_annotator_call function with the model, image, and resolution to generate the depth map."
