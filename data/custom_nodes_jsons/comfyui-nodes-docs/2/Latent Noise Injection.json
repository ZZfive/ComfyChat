        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'inject_noise' method in the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The 'inject_noise' method is designed to introduce random noise into a set of latent samples, enhancing the diversity of the generated output. This method is crucial for applications that require introducing random variations in the latent space to simulate real-world data distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'samples' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is a critical input that represents the latent space vectors into which noise will be injected. It is essential for the node's execution as it determines the basis onto which random variations will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'noise_std' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Noise class control?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_std' parameter determines the standard deviation of the noise to be added to the samples. It is an optional parameter that allows users to control the degree of randomness introduced into the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Latent_Noise class is the modified latent space vectors with injected noise. This output is significant as it forms the basis for subsequent processing or generation steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Latent_Noise class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'noise_std' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'noise_std' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Noise class is 0.1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'inject_noise' function in the WAS_Latent_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'inject_noise' function in the WAS_Latent_Noise class is 'LATENT', which represents the modified latent space vectors with injected noise."
