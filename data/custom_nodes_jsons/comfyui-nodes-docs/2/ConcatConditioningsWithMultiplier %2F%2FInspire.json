        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node is designed to enhance condition inputs by multiplying them with a specified factor, allowing for adjustment of condition strength in complex workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'conditioning1' of Comfy dtype CONDITIONING, and the optional input type is 'multiplier1' of Comfy dtype FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node represent?",
        "answer": "The output represents the enhanced condition data, which is a combination of the original input and additional conditions each multiplied by their respective factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node handle multiple condition inputs?",
        "answer": "The node multiplies each condition input by its respective multiplier and concatenates them with the main conditioning input, but only the first condition from each additional input is actually applied to the main conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'multiplier1' input in the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'multiplier1' input is 1.0, with a minimum of 0.0, a maximum of 10.0, and a step of 0.01."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'doit' method in the ConcatConditioningsWithMultiplier class?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method takes the input conditionings and multipliers, multiplies each conditioning by its respective multiplier, and concatenates them to produce the enhanced condition output."
