        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node in ComfyUI is used to configure the motion model settings for the AnimateDiff process, allowing users to fine-tune motion proportion parameters to achieve the desired animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node are: pe_strength, attn_strength, other_strength, motion_pe_stretch, cap_initial_pe_length, interpolate_pe_to_length, initial_pe_idx_offset, and final_pe_idx_offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the pe_strength parameter control in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The pe_strength parameter in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node decides the strength of the position encoding adjustment, affecting the spatial dynamics of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the mask_motion_scale parameter in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The mask_motion_scale parameter in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node selectively applies a mask to scale the motion of different parts of the image, enhancing the realism and complexity of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the min_motion_scale parameter set in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The min_motion_scale parameter in the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node sets the minimum scale of motion, ensuring that the animation does not fall below this threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node is AD_SETTINGS, which contains the configured motion model settings with adjustments to the motion proportion parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node use?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvanced node uses the CPU infra type."
