        "question": "What is the purpose of the Pixel Deflicker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Deflicker node in ComfyUI is designed to reduce flickering in image sequences and improve visual consistency between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What techniques does the Pixel Deflicker node use to achieve its purpose?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Deflicker node combines temporal smoothing and adaptive blending techniques to alleviate rapid brightness changes, resulting in smoother transitions and higher image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Pixel Deflicker node are: images (a batch of images to be processed), window_size (specifies the window size for temporal smoothing), blending_strength (controls the blending intensity between the original and smoothed frames), and batch_size (determines the number of images processed at a time)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the window_size parameter in the Pixel Deflicker node control?",
        "answer": "The window_size parameter in the Pixel Deflicker node specifies the size of the window used for temporal smoothing, which affects the degree of flicker reduction across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the blending_strength parameter affect the output of the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The blending_strength parameter in the Pixel Deflicker node controls the mixing intensity between the original frames and the smoothed frames, allowing fine-tuning of the flicker reduction effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Pixel Deflicker node is an image tensor containing the batch of images with reduced flickering, demonstrating enhanced visual consistency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Pixel Deflicker node is GPU."
