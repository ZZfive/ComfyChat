    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'bbox' parameter in the From_SEG_ELT_bbox node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it defines the spatial boundaries of the element to be processed, directly influencing the accuracy and relevance of the node's output by identifying the specific area of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'left' parameter in the output of From_SEG_ELT_bbox node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'left' parameter represents the coordinate of the leftmost edge of the bounding box, marking the beginning of the horizontal span. It is essential in defining the spatial extent of the element within the processed data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'top' parameter provide in the output of From_SEG_ELT_bbox node?",
        "answer": "The 'top' parameter indicates the coordinate of the uppermost edge of the bounding box, signaling the start of the vertical span. It is crucial for identifying the vertical position of the element within the dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the From_SEG_ELT_bbox node, what does the 'right' parameter signify?",
        "answer": "The 'right' parameter signifies the coordinate of the rightmost edge of the bounding box, marking the end of the horizontal span. It is vital in determining the width of the element and its spatial boundaries within the dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What aspect of the bounding box does the 'bottom' parameter represent in the output of From_SEG_ELT_bbox node?",
        "answer": "The 'bottom' parameter represents the coordinate of the lowermost edge of the bounding box, indicating the end of the vertical span. It is essential in establishing the height of the element and its complete vertical range within the processed data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the From_SEG_ELT_bbox node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the From_SEG_ELT_bbox node is CPU."
