        "question": "What is the purpose of SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider node is designed to apply a filtering mechanism to the segmentation process. It filters segments according to specified ranges, ensuring that only segments meeting the defined criteria are considered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'target' parameter define in SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider?",
        "answer": "The 'target' parameter defines the region of interest for the segmentation process. It is crucial as it determines which segments will be filtered. The node operates based on the provided dimensions and coordinates, making this parameter the core of the filtering process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' parameter in SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider affect the segmentation results?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines whether to keep segments inside or outside the target area. It is a binary choice that significantly impacts the outcome of the segmentation, allowing precise control over the filtering criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'min_value' parameter play in SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter sets the minimum threshold for segment values. It plays a key role in filtering out segments that do not meet the minimum standard, thus refining the segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'max_value' parameter in SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter sets the maximum limit for segment values. It ensures that segments exceeding this limit are excluded from the final segmentation, maintaining the integrity of the filtering output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider?",
        "answer": "The output of SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider is a DETAILER_HOOK, which is a hook object that encapsulates the filtering criteria and applies them to the segmentation process. It is significant as it represents the result of the node's operation, providing a means to integrate the filtering logic into a broader segmentation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider use?",
        "answer": "SEGSRangeFilterDetailerHookProvider uses CPU as the infrastructure type."
