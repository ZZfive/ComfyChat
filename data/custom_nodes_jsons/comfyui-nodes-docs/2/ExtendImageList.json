        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendImageList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendImageList node is designed to add new images to an existing list of images, focusing on aggregating multiple image resources into a comprehensive collection for operations that require batch image data management."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ExtendImageList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter is crucial for defining the starting point of the collection before extension. It represents the initial number of images to be extended, laying the foundation for the extension process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'inputs_len' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'inputs_len' parameter uses the INT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the ExtendImageList node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter represents the final collection of images after the extension process. It includes both the original images and the newly added images, providing a unified collection for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'image' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'image' parameter uses the IMAGE data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the corresponding Python data type for the 'image' parameter?",
        "answer": "The corresponding Python data type for the 'image' parameter is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the ExtendImageList node?",
        "answer": "The ExtendImageList node is associated with the 'CPU' infra type."
