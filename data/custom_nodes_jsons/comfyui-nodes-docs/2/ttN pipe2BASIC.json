        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN pipe2BASIC node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipe2BASIC node in ComfyUI is designed to simplify the structure of a given pipeline by extracting and repackaging its core components, converting it into a basic pipeline format. This process helps to more easily manipulate and understand the basic elements of the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ttN pipe2BASIC node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ttN pipe2BASIC node is 'pipe', which is the pipeline that needs to be simplified. It contains various components such as models, clips, and VAE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ttN pipe2BASIC node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ttN pipe2BASIC node are 'basic_pipe' and 'pipe'. 'basic_pipe' is the simplified version of the input pipeline, containing only its basic components such as model, clip, VAE, and positive and negative conditions. 'pipe' returns the original pipeline received during input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ttN pipe2BASIC node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ttN pipe2BASIC node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ttN pipe2BASIC node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ttN pipe2BASIC node is 'ttN/pipe'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'basic_pipe' output of the ttN pipe2BASIC node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'basic_pipe' output of the ttN pipe2BASIC node contains the simplified version of the input pipeline, including only its basic components such as model, clip, VAE, and positive and negative conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' output of the ttN pipe2BASIC node return?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' output of the ttN pipe2BASIC node returns the original pipeline received during input, allowing for further manipulation or inspection."
