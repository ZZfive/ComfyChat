        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node in ComfyUI simplifies the process of exporting SMPL models to 3D software, making it easier for users to integrate these models into various 3D CGI workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node are 'smpl', which specifies the SMPL model to be exported, 'foldername_prefix', which allows users to specify a prefix for the output folder, and 'format', which determines the file format of the exported model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'smpl' input specify in the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node?",
        "answer": "The 'smpl' input in the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node specifies the SMPL model to be exported, which is crucial for the node to process and prepare the model for export to 3D software."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'foldername_prefix' input help in organizing exported files?",
        "answer": "The 'foldername_prefix' input in the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node allows users to specify a prefix for the output folder, providing a way to organize the exported files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'format' input in the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node?",
        "answer": "The 'format' input in the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node determines the file format of the exported model, such as 'glb', allowing users to choose a format compatible with their 3D software environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node have any output types?",
        "answer": "No, the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node does not have any output types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ExportSMPLTo3DSoftware node is 'CPU'."
