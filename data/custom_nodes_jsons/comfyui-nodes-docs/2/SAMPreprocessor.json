        "question": "What is the purpose of the SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAMPreprocessor node is designed to use the SAM (Segment Anything Model) method to segment images. It preprocesses the image to enhance its effect and prepares it for further processing or analysis, especially focusing on segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SAMPreprocessor node is an image, which needs to be segmented. This is the main data that the SAMPreprocessor operates on, aiming to identify and segment various elements in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the SAMPreprocessor node is resolution. It specifies the resolution to which the input image will be adjusted before processing. This parameter may affect the accuracy and performance of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SAMPreprocessor node is an image, which is a segmented version of the input image. Different segmented parts are identified and separated in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the SAMPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SAMPreprocessor node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAMPreprocessor node is classified in the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/others' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SAMPreprocessor node's execute function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the SAMPreprocessor node's execute function is a tuple containing a single element of type 'IMAGE'."
