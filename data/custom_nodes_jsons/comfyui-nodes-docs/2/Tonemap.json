        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tonemap node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Tonemap node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the tone mapping of images, making them suitable for display on different devices or achieving specific visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported color spaces for input and output in the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The Tonemap node supports linear and sRGB color spaces for both input and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the Tonemap node adjusts the intensity of the tone mapping effect, allowing for finer control over the visual appearance of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'images' input in the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'images' input is of type IMAGE, while in Python, it is of type torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Tonemap node handle the conversion between linear and sRGB color spaces?",
        "answer": "If the input mode is sRGB, the Tonemap node first converts the image to linear color space. After applying the tone mapping, if the output mode is sRGB, it converts the image back to sRGB color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The Tonemap node has an infra type of CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'tonemap_scale' parameter is 1."
