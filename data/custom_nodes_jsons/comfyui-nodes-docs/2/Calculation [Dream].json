        "question": "What is the purpose of the Calculation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Calculation node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically evaluate mathematical expressions based on user-defined variables and constants."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of arithmetic operations can be included in the expression input of the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The expression input of the Calculation node can contain variables and arithmetic operations, serving as the blueprint for the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'expression' input in the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The 'expression' input in the Calculation node is of STRING data type in ComfyUI and str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input variables available in the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The Calculation node has optional input variables: 'a_int', 'b_int', 'c_int', 'r_float', 's_float', and 't_float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a_int' variable represent in the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a_int' variable in the Calculation node represents an integer variable 'a' that can be used in the expression and will affect the calculation result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The Calculation node outputs two data types: FLOAT (the floating-point result of the evaluated expression) and INT (the rounded integer result)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the integer result obtained in the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The integer result in the Calculation node is obtained by rounding the floating-point result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Calculation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Calculation node is CPU."
