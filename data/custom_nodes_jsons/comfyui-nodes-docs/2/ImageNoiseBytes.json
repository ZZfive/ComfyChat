        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageNoiseBytes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageNoiseBytes node in ComfyUI applies a specific type of noise transformation to an image based on provided parameters. It operates on pixel values in one or more channels, enhancing the image with an adjustable monochromatic or color noise effect that can be selectively inverted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageNoiseBytes node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageNoiseBytes node are: images (the input image to which the noise effect will be applied), monochromatic (determines whether the noise effect should be applied in a monochromatic way across all channels or separately for each channel), invert (specifies whether the noise effect should be inverted), and channels (defines the specific channels of the image to which the noise effect will be applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'monochromatic' parameter affect the noise effect in the ImageNoiseBytes node?",
        "answer": "The 'monochromatic' parameter in the ImageNoiseBytes node determines whether the noise effect should be applied in a single color across all channels (if true) or separately for each channel (if false), affecting the visual appearance of the noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter do in the ImageNoiseBytes node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in the ImageNoiseBytes node specifies whether the noise effect should be inverted, changing the visual contrast of the noise effect in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'channels' parameter specify in the ImageNoiseBytes node?",
        "answer": "The 'channels' parameter in the ImageNoiseBytes node defines the specific color channels of the image to which the noise effect will be applied, allowing for targeted noise application on selected channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageNoiseBytes node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageNoiseBytes node is an image that has been transformed with the noise effect, showing the visual variations produced by the noise parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageNoiseBytes node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageNoiseBytes node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
