        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltListClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltListClamp node is designed to adjust the values in a given list to ensure they fall within a specified minimum and maximum range, a process known as 'clamping'. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing values from exceeding predetermined boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'schedule_list' parameter in the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_list' parameter in the SaltListClamp node is the list of values that need to be clamped. This parameter is essential for defining the range of data that will undergo the clamping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min_value' parameter in the SaltListClamp node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter in the SaltListClamp node represents the minimum allowed value in the list after clamping. This parameter sets the lower limit for the clamping operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_value' parameter in the SaltListClamp node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter in the SaltListClamp node represents the maximum allowed value in the list after clamping. This parameter establishes the upper limit for the clamping operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltListClamp node is the clamped result list, where all values have been adjusted to fall within the specified minimum and maximum range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltListClamp node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'min_value' is greater than the 'max_value' in the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "If the 'min_value' is greater than the 'max_value' in the SaltListClamp node, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Schedules min_value cannot be greater than max_value.'"
