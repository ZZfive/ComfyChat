        "question": "What is the purpose of the InjectNoiseToLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InjectNoiseToLatent node in ComfyUI is designed to introduce noise into latent space representations, simulating the influence of noise on the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InjectNoiseToLatent node are 'latents' (the original latent space representation), 'strength' (the intensity of the noise to be injected), and 'noise' (the noise pattern to be added to the latent space)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'normalize' parameter do in the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "When the 'normalize' parameter is set to True, it normalizes the noised latent samples to ensure that the distribution does not become overly skewed after noise injection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask' parameter affect the output of the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'mask' parameter specifies the regions of the latent space where the noise should be applied, providing a means of controlling the spatial distribution of the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mix_randn_amount' parameter in the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'mix_randn_amount' parameter allows mixing random noise with the existing noise pattern, introducing additional variability to the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'seed' parameter important in the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter ensures that the randomness in the noise generation process is reproducible, which is useful for consistent experimental results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InjectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InjectNoiseToLatent node is 'latents', which represents the modified latent space representation after the noise injection process."
