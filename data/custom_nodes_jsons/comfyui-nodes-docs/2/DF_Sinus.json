        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Sinus node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sinus node is used to calculate the sine value of a given angle. It supports inputs in radians or degrees and provides the option to compute the arcsine, offering flexibility for trigonometric calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the DF_Sinus node are 'value', which is the angle to calculate the sine value for, 'type_', which specifies the unit of the input angle ('RAD' for radians or 'DEG' for degrees), and 'arcSin', a boolean flag that determines whether to perform the sine or arcsine operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'type_' parameter in the DF_Sinus node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'type_' parameter in the DF_Sinus node specifies the unit of the input angle. It can be set to 'RAD' for radians or 'DEG' for degrees, which affects how the input value is interpreted before the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the 'arcSin' parameter to 'True' in the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "When the 'arcSin' parameter is set to 'True', the operation of the DF_Sinus node changes from sine to arcsine, allowing for inverse trigonometric calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Sinus node is a float value, which represents the result of the sine or arcsine calculation based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the DF_Sinus node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the DF_Sinus node located within the ComfyUI node hierarchy?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sinus node is located in the Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry category within the ComfyUI node hierarchy."
