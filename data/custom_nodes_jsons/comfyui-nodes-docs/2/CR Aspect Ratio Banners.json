        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_AspectRatioBanners node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_AspectRatioBanners node is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of image banners that conform to various aspect ratios, simplifying the process of generating visually consistent banners suitable for diverse display purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_AspectRatioBanners node allow users to input custom dimensions for banners?",
        "answer": "The node allows users to input custom dimensions by providing width and height parameters. These parameters are crucial in determining the overall size of the output image, ensuring the banners fit the desired constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What options does the CR_AspectRatioBanners node provide for handling the aspect ratio of banners?",
        "answer": "The CR_AspectRatioBanners node provides the option to input a custom aspect ratio or select from a predefined list of banner sizes. This feature ensures that the banners are visually appealing and suitable for their intended use."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users adjust the size of banners without altering the aspect ratio using the CR_AspectRatioBanners node?",
        "answer": "Users can adjust the size of banners without altering the aspect ratio by using the upscale_factor parameter, which increases the size of the banner, enhancing its visual quality on larger display devices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the prescale_factor parameter play in the CR_AspectRatioBanners node?",
        "answer": "The prescale_factor parameter allows for the adjustment of the banner size before further processing, optimizing the image size and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_AspectRatioBanners node support efficient processing of multiple banner creation tasks?",
        "answer": "The batch_size parameter defines the number of banners processed simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency when handling multiple banner creation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_AspectRatioBanners node provide flexibility in interpreting and utilizing banner dimensions?",
        "answer": "The swap_dimensions parameter in the CR_AspectRatioBanners node allows for the interchangeability of width and height values, providing flexibility in interpreting and utilizing banner dimensions."
