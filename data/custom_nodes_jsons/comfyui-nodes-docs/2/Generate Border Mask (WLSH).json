        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node is responsible for generating an edge mask based on a given direction and image. It creates a mask that can be used for inpainting tasks, ensuring that the masked area aligns with the specified direction such as 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), direction (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), pixels (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and overlap (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'direction' parameter specify in the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter determines the direction of the mask to be generated. It is a crucial input as it influences how the mask will be applied to the image, affecting the final outcome of the inpainting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'pixels' parameter affect the generated mask in the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' parameter specifies the size of the mask edge in pixels. It is an important factor in controlling the range of the masked area and directly affects the execution of the node and the accuracy of the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'overlap' parameter in the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'overlap' parameter defines the thickness of the mask edge. It is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition between the masked and unmasked areas. By preventing abrupt edges, it helps improve the quality of the inpainting results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node is a mask (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WLSH_Generate_Edge_Mask node is CPU."
