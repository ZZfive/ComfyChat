        "question": "What is the purpose of the FILM_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FILM_VFI node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance video content by increasing frame rates and smoothness without sacrificing visual quality, through frame interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the FILM_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter in the FILM_VFI node specifies the pre-trained model used for frame interpolation, directly influencing the quality and accuracy of the interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter in the FILM_VFI node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter in the FILM_VFI node determines the number of additional frames to be generated between each pair of input frames, controlling the density of the output video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter in the FILM_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter in the FILM_VFI node allows customization of the frame interpolation process by specifying which frames should be skipped or not, providing a level of control over the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_frames' in the FILM_VFI node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'output_frames' in the FILM_VFI node represents the result of the frame interpolation process, including the original input frames and the newly generated intermediate frames, providing a higher frame rate video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the FILM_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the FILM_VFI node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FILM_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the FILM_VFI node in ComfyUI is ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/VFI."
