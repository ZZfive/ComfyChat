        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeInput1 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeInput1 node in ComfyUI serves as the input interface for the Searge system, collecting and organizing various prompts and optional inputs to simplify the input process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SeargeInput1 node are main_prompt, secondary_prompt, style_prompt, negative_prompt, and negative_style."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the main_prompt parameter in the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The main_prompt parameter is crucial for defining the primary context or subject of the input in the SeargeInput1 node. It allows for a detailed description spanning multiple lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the negative_prompt parameter in the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The negative_prompt parameter in the SeargeInput1 node is used to indicate aspects or features that should be avoided in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the image parameter in the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The image parameter in the SeargeInput1 node is an optional input that allows for the inclusion of visual data for processing, significantly influencing the execution and nature of the output when dealing with image-related tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mask parameter do in the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The mask parameter in the SeargeInput1 node is an optional input that defines regions of an image that should be treated differently or ignored during processing. It is essential for tasks requiring selective operation on visual data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SeargeInput1 node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SeargeInput1 node is a structured collection of parameters called 'inputs' that encapsulates the prompts and optional inputs provided by the node. It forms the basis for subsequent processing steps within the Searge system."
