        "question": "What is the purpose of KfDebug_Latent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Latent node in ComfyUI is designed to provide insights into the latent space representation generated by keyframed models. It serves as a diagnostic tool, allowing inspection and analysis of latent features, which is crucial for understanding the underlying structure and quality of the model's data processing capabilities."

    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the KfDebug_Latent node?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Latent node requires an input type called 'input_data'. This parameter is the raw data input to the node and is expected in the form of a PyTorch tensor. It is essential as it forms the basis for the node to perform latent space analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfDebug_Latent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfDebug_Latent node is 'latent_representation'. This output provides the processed latent space data derived from the node's analysis. It contains the information extracted from the 'input_data' and offers a condensed view of the latent features, which is useful for further research or visualization of the model's latent space."
