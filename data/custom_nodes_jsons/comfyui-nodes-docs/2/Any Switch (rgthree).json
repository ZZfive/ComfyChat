        "question": "What is the purpose of the Any Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Any Switch node is designed to select and output the first non-empty item from a set of optional inputs. It abstracts away the complexity of evaluating various types of inputs to find the first one that is not considered 'empty' or 'none', making it versatile across different data types and scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Any Switch node determine the order of evaluating inputs?",
        "answer": "The Any Switch node evaluates the inputs in the order they are named, starting from 'any_01' and going up to 'any_05'. It selects the first non-empty input it encounters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types can be used as inputs for the Any Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Any Switch node accepts any data type for its optional inputs. The input naming convention is suitable for all inputs from 'any_01' to 'any_05', indicating their order in the selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Any Switch node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Any Switch node represents the first non-empty input it encounters among the optional inputs provided to the node. This output is versatile and can accommodate any data type that is supplied to the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is commonly used with the Any Switch node?",
        "answer": "The commonly used infrastructure type with the Any Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional inputs can the Any Switch node handle?",
        "answer": "The Any Switch node can handle up to five optional inputs, named from 'any_01' to 'any_05'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'switch' function in the Any Switch node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'switch' function in the Any Switch node is a tuple containing a single element of any data type ('any_type'), representing the first non-empty input encountered."
