        "question": "What is the purpose of the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node in ComfyUI is designed to provide deterministic or randomized seed values for various operations in the image saving process. It ensures that operations can be repeated using a fixed seed or varied using random seeds, supporting consistency and diversity in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Seed Generator node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Seed Generator node is 'seed', which allows users to specify a seed value for generating deterministic output. If not provided, a default value is used to ensure repeatability or randomness of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Seed Generator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Seed Generator node is 'int', representing a seed value that can be used to initialize random number generators or other processes requiring a seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Seed Generator node use?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which common nodes are mentioned in the usage tips for the Seed Generator node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes mentioned in the usage tips for the Seed Generator node include KSampler, FaceDetailer, UltimateSDUpscaleNoUpscale, Reroute, KSamplerAdvanced (Inspire), and DetailerForEach."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Seed Generator node?",
        "answer": "The category of the Seed Generator node is 'ImageSaverTools/utils'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the Seed Generator node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the Seed Generator node is 'INT'."
