        "question": "What is the purpose of the Cosines node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Cosines node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the cosine value of a given angle, and it also provides an option to calculate the arccosine. It supports both degrees and radians as angle units."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Cosines node are: value (the angle for which the cosine or arccosine is to be calculated), type_ (specifies the unit of the input angle, either radians 'RAD' or degrees 'DEG'), and arcCos (a boolean flag that, when set to True, changes the operation from calculating cosine to calculating the arccosine of the given angle)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Cosines node is a float, which represents the calculated cosine (or arccosine) value of the given angle."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the Cosines node use?",
        "answer": "The Cosines node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Cosines node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Cosines node is classified under the 'Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'type_' input in the Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The 'type_' input in the Cosines node specifies the unit of the input angle, which can be either radians ('RAD') or degrees ('DEG'). This affects how the angle is interpreted during the trigonometric calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'arcCos' input affect the calculation in the Cosines node?",
        "answer": "When the 'arcCos' input is set to True, the Cosines node calculates the arccosine of the given angle instead of the cosine."
