        "question": "What is the purpose of the If node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The If node in ComfyUI is a conditional execution unit that evaluates the input condition and decides which of the two provided branches to take, thus building control flow in the computation graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the If node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the If node are 'any', 'if', and 'else'. 'any' is the condition expression, 'if' is the action to be executed when the condition is satisfied, and 'else' is the alternative action when the condition is not satisfied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'any' input determine in the If node?",
        "answer": "The 'any' input in the If node determines which output branch will be executed based on the condition expression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'if' input in the If node?",
        "answer": "The 'if' input in the If node represents the action to be executed when the 'any' condition is satisfied. It defines the affirmative result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'else' input in the If node?",
        "answer": "The 'else' input in the If node defines the alternative action to be executed when the 'any' condition is not satisfied. It provides complete conditional logic within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the If node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the If node is '?' which represents the result from either the 'if' or 'else' input based on the evaluation of the 'any' condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the If node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the If node is CPU."
