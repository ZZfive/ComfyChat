        "question": "What is the purpose of the cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced to allow for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cg-noise custom node generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise custom node generates variations in images using a weight 'x' and two seeds. It generates the noise based on 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the specific name of the custom node mentioned in the provided text?",

        "question": "What is the significance of the weight 'x' in the cg-noise custom node?",
        "answer": "In the cg-noise custom node, the weight 'x' is used to control the balance between the variation seed and the original seed when generating noise for image variations."
