        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageNoiseGaussian node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageNoiseGaussian node in ComfyUI is used to add Gaussian noise to images. It allows adjusting the noise intensity and provides options to apply the noise monochromatically or invert the noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageNoiseGaussian node are: images (the input image to which Gaussian noise will be applied), strength (defines the intensity of the Gaussian noise to be applied), monochromatic (determines whether the noise should be applied monochromatically across all channels or individually per channel), invert (when set to true, inverts the noise effect, subtracting noise from the image instead of adding it), and channels (specifies the image channels on which the noise should be applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'monochromatic' parameter affect the application of noise in the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The 'monochromatic' parameter in the ImageNoiseGaussian node determines whether the noise should be applied uniformly across all channels (if true) or individually per channel (if false). This affects the visual effect of the noise application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter do in the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in the ImageNoiseGaussian node, when set to true, inverts the noise effect by subtracting noise from the image instead of adding it. This can result in a different visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'channels' parameter work in the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The 'channels' parameter in the ImageNoiseGaussian node specifies the image channels on which the noise should be applied. It allows for targeted noise application on specific color channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageNoiseGaussian node is the image with the applied Gaussian noise, reflecting the specified strength, monochromatic setting, and inversion preference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the ImageNoiseGaussian node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the ImageNoiseGaussian node is GPU."
