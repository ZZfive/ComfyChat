        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean_Primitive node is designed to process and return a boolean value. It serves as the fundamental building block in logic operations, ensuring the integrity of boolean calculations within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it directly influences the logical result of the 'do' method. It is the primary input that determines the node's behavior and the resulting boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output parameter represent in the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output parameter represents the outcome of the boolean operation performed by the 'do' method. It is significant because it provides the final boolean value after processing the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean_Primitive node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'boolean' input parameter in the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'boolean' input parameter in the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types of the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node is BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the WAS_Boolean_Primitive node classified?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Boolean_Primitive node is classified under the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category."
