        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node in ComfyUI applies a bloom effect to an image by simulating the scattering of light to enhance its visual appeal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node is an image on which the bloom filter will be applied. This is the main object that the node processes and it directly affects the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'radius' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter in the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node controls the range of the Gaussian blur used to create the bloom effect. It is an important factor in determining the softness of the bloom."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'intensity' parameter affect the bloom effect in the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity' parameter in the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node adjusts the brightness of the bloom effect. Higher values result in a more pronounced bloom, while lower values produce a more subtle effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node is the processed image with the bloom filter applied. It represents the final visual result of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the bloom effect be adjusted using the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The bloom effect can be adjusted using the WAS_Image_Bloom_Filter node by modifying the 'radius' and 'intensity' parameters. The 'radius' controls the softness of the bloom, while the 'intensity' adjusts its brightness."
