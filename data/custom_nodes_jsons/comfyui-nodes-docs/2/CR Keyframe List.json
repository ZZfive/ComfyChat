        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_KeyframeList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_KeyframeList node is designed to manage and process keyframe lists, which are sequences of frames that define an animation timeline. It plays a crucial role in the animation workflow by allowing users to input keyframe data and specify the format for correct interpretation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_KeyframeList node?",
        "answer": "The CR_KeyframeList node requires two input types: 'keyframe_list', which is a string containing the sequence of frames defining the animation, and 'keyframe_format', which determines how the keyframe list is interpreted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'keyframe_format' parameter in the CR_KeyframeList node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_format' parameter in the CR_KeyframeList node specifies how the keyframe list should be interpreted. It is important for ensuring that the node correctly understands and processes the keyframe data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_KeyframeList node?",
        "answer": "The CR_KeyframeList node outputs two types: 'keyframe_list', which is the processed keyframe list formatted according to the specified keyframe format, ready for use in the animation sequence, and 'show_help', which is a URL linking to a documentation page providing additional information and guidance on using the keyframe list feature."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'show_help' output in the CR_KeyframeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_KeyframeList node is a URL that links to a documentation page. This page provides additional information and guidance on using the keyframe list feature in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the CR_KeyframeList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the CR_KeyframeList node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the CR_KeyframeList node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CR_KeyframeList node defines the class CR_KeyframeList with methods for specifying input and output types, and a function 'keyframelist' that processes the keyframe list and returns the processed list along with a help URL."
