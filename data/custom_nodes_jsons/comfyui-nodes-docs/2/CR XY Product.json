        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_XYProduct node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYProduct node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a cross-join operation on two lists of strings. It takes two multi-line text inputs and generates all possible combinations of elements from the two lists, creating a Cartesian product."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_XYProduct node are 'text_x' and 'text_y', both of which are multi-line text inputs representing the two string lists to be used in the cross-join operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text_x' parameter in the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_x' parameter in the CR_XYProduct node is a multi-line text input that represents the first string list to be used in the cross-join operation. It plays a key role in determining the elements that will be combined with the elements from 'text_y'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text_y' parameter in the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_y' parameter in the CR_XYProduct node is another multi-line text input that represents the second string list to be used in the cross-join operation. It works together with 'text_x' to produce the Cartesian product."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_XYProduct node are 'x_values', 'y_values', and 'show_help'. 'x_values' and 'y_values' are string lists representing the elements from the first and second input lists after the cross-join operation, respectively. 'show_help' provides a URL link for further help or information about the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x_values' output represent in the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_values' output in the CR_XYProduct node is a string list that represents the elements from the first input list after the cross-join operation. It contains the first element of each unique combination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'y_values' output represent in the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The 'y_values' output in the CR_XYProduct node is a string list that represents the elements from the second input list after the cross-join operation. It contains the second element of each unique combination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_XYProduct node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_XYProduct node provides a URL link for obtaining further help or information about the node's operation."
