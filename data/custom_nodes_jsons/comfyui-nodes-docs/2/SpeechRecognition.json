        "question": "What is the purpose of the SpeechRecognition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SpeechRecognition node in ComfyUI is designed to convert audio input into text, playing a crucial role in applications that require speech to be transformed into written form, such as voice command systems or transcription services."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'upload' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node?",
        "answer": "The 'upload' parameter is essential for the SpeechRecognition node as it serves as the source of the audio data to be processed. It is a required input that directly affects the operation of the node and the quality of the speech recognition output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_by' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node allow users to specify?",
        "answer": "The 'start_by' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node allows users to specify the starting point of the speech recognition process in the audio file, potentially improving efficiency and accuracy by focusing the recognition task on a specific portion of the audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'prompt' output in the SpeechRecognition node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' output in the SpeechRecognition node represents the text transcribed from the input audio, containing the primary function of the node and providing users with a textual representation of spoken content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the SpeechRecognition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the SpeechRecognition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'start_by' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node required or optional?",
        "answer": "The 'start_by' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node is optional, with a default value of 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the valid data types for the 'upload' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node?",
        "answer": "The valid data types for the 'upload' parameter in the SpeechRecognition node are Union[str, bytes] in Python dtype and AUDIOINPUTMIX in Comfy dtype."
