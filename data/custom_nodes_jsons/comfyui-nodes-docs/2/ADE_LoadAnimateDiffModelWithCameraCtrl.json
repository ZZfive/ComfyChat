        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node is designed to load AnimateDiff models with integrated camera control capabilities, allowing camera movements and adjustments to be applied directly within the AnimateDiff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node are 'model_name' (specifies the name of the motion model to load) and 'camera_ctrl' (defines the camera control parameters to be injected into the AnimateDiff model)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModelWithCameraCtrl node is 'ad_settings', which allows further customization of the animation process using AnimateDiff settings."
    },
    {
