        "question": "What is the main purpose of the hiresFix node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of the hiresFix node is to increase the resolution of images while maintaining or improving their visual quality, by using various upscaling techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the model_name parameter in the hiresFix node?",
        "answer": "The model_name parameter is crucial for selecting the appropriate upscaling model, which determines the specific algorithm used for the image enhancement process and significantly influences the output quality and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the rescale_after_model parameter affect the image in the hiresFix node?",
        "answer": "The rescale_after_model parameter determines whether the image size should be adjusted after upscaling. This impacts the final dimensions of the processed image and may be essential for adapting to specific display or printing requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the percent parameter specify in the hiresFix node when rescaling by percentage?",
        "answer": "The percent parameter specifies the percentage by which the image should be enlarged when resizing 'by percentage'. It directly affects the final size of the image, with higher values leading to a significant increase in dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the pipe output in the hiresFix node?",
        "answer": "The pipe output provides a structured representation of the processing pipeline, including the model and parameters used. It is essential for maintaining consistency and reproducibility in the image enhancement workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the image output in the hiresFix node contain?",
        "answer": "The image output contains an enhanced version of the input image, which is the high-resolution version. It is the main result of the node's operation and is crucial for visual verification of the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the latent output in the hiresFix node represent?",
        "answer": "The latent output represents an encoded version of the image that can be used for further processing or analysis. It serves as an intermediate representation capturing the essential features of the image."
