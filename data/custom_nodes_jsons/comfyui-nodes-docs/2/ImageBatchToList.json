        "question": "What is the main function of the ImageBatchToList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main function of the ImageBatchToList node is to convert a batch of images into a list format, which is useful for scenarios that require individual processing or manipulation of each image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageBatchToList node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageBatchToList node is 'images', which represents the batch of images to be converted into a list. It is crucial for the node's functionality as it provides the raw data to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageBatchToList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageBatchToList node is a list of images, where each image from the batch becomes a separate element in the list. This format conversion makes it more convenient to perform operations on individual images and provides more possibilities for subsequent image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ImageBatchToList node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ImageBatchToList node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageBatchToList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchToList node belongs to the 'Bmad/image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageBatchToList node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageBatchToList node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'to_list' function in the ImageBatchToList class?",
        "answer": "The 'to_list' function in the ImageBatchToList class returns a tuple containing a list of torch.Tensor objects representing the separated images from the input batch."
