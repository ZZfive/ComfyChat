        "question": "What is the purpose of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node integrates MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology into the ComfyUI framework to enable facial feature detection. It serves as a provider that can introduce FaceMesh detection capabilities into segmentation or other image processing workflows, thereby achieving advanced facial analysis and processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the max_faces parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The max_faces parameter specifies the maximum number of faces to be detected in a given image, controlling the scope of the detection process. Its data type in ComfyUI is INT, and in Python, it is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the face parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node indicate?",
        "answer": "The face parameter indicates whether to enable and how to configure the detection of facial features. Its data type in ComfyUI is BOOLEAN, and in Python, it is bool."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node provide?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node provides two output types: bbox_detector, which offers a detector configured for facial feature bounding box detection, and segm_detector, which provides a detector configured for facial feature segmentation detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node belong?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node belongs to the InspirePack/Detector category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The return types of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node are BBOX_DETECTOR and SEGM_DETECTOR."
