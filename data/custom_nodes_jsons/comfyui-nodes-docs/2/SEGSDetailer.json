        "question": "What is the function of the SEGSDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The SEGSDetailer node is designed to enhance the details of images based on segmentation information. It operates by scaling and processing the image segments, specifically focusing on the parts of the image identified for detailed enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSDetailer node work?",
        "answer": "The node uses advanced depth learning models to achieve detailed image enhancement. It identifies the image segments where details need to be improved based on the segmentation data provided and applies the necessary processing to these segments to create a more detailed output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does the SEGSDetailer node require?",
        "answer": "The node requires input types such as 'image' (the image to be enhanced) and 'segs' (the segmentation data which helps the node understand which parts of the image require detailed enhancement)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types does the SEGSDetailer node take?",
        "answer": "The node has optional input types like 'guide_size' (a parameter affecting the scaling factor of the detail enhancement process), 'steps' (the number of steps in the detail enhancement process), and various other parameters controlling the enhancement process like 'cfg', 'sampler_name', 'scheduler', 'denoise', 'noise_mask', and 'force_inpaint'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the SEGSDetailer node produce?",
        "answer": "The node produces output types such as 'segs' (the segmentation data after enhancement) and 'cnet_images' (control net images generated during the enhancement process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'guide_size' parameter in the SEGSDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The 'guide_size' parameter in the SEGSDetailer node determines the scaling factor for the detail enhancement process. It impacts the extent to which the image segments are scaled before detailed processing, thereby affecting the level of detail in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSDetailer node benefit from the segmentation data?",
        "answer": "The SEGSDetailer node uses segmentation data to identify specific regions of the input image that require enhancement. This targeted approach allows for the focused improvement of image details in relevant areas, leading to higher quality outputs customized to the segmented information."
