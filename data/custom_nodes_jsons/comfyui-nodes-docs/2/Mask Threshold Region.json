        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node is used to apply thresholding to images for masking, segmenting the image into different regions based on color or brightness levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'masks', which are images to be thresholded. The optional input types are 'black_threshold' and 'white_threshold', representing the lower and upper thresholds for color classification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The output type is 'MASKS', which are binary masks representing the thresholded regions of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the black threshold in the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the black threshold is 75."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the white threshold in the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the white threshold is 175."

    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code of the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node is written in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What library is used to convert the thresholded mask back into tensor format in the WAS_Mask_Threshold_Region node?",
        "answer": "The library used is 'pil2mask'."
