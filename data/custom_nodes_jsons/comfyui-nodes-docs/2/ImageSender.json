        "question": "What is the primary function of the ImageSender node?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the ImageSender node is to facilitate the transmission of image data. It processes a series of images, assigns prefixes to their filenames, and sends them to a specified server endpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the ImageSender node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the ImageSender node as it represents the collection of visual data to be processed and transmitted. The appropriate selection and format of this parameter directly affect the node's ability to perform its task."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'filename_prefix' parameter assist in organizing images?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter helps in organizing images by defining a common prefix for the filenames of the images being processed. This aids in systematically organizing and identifying images in the receiving system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'link_id' parameter play in the ImageSender node?",
        "answer": "The 'link_id' parameter is an identifier used to associate images with a specific link or context in the receiving system. It assists in the targeted delivery and referencing of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'prompt' parameter in the ImageSender node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter, although optional, can be used to provide additional context or instructions for image processing. It enhances the functionality of the node by allowing for finer control over image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter be beneficial for image data?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter allows for the inclusion of additional metadata or information in PNG images. This is useful for enhancing image data with extra details that the receiving system may require."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output of the ImageSender node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output of the ImageSender node contains the outcome of the image transmission process. It includes the images that were sent and any associated metadata, providing a comprehensive overview of the node's operation."
