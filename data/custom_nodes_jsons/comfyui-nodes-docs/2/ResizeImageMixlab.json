        "question": "What is the purpose of the ResizeImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ResizeImage node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the size of an image according to specified requirements. It can cleverly resize the image to the desired width and height while maintaining the integrity of the visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ResizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ResizeImage node are 'width', 'height', 'scale_option', 'image', 'average_color', 'fill_color', and 'mask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scale_option' parameter affect image resizing in the ResizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_option' parameter in the ResizeImage node indicates how the image should be resized. It allows for scaling based on width, height, overall size, or centered within the new dimensions, providing flexibility in maintaining or altering the image's aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'average_color' parameter do in the ResizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'average_color' parameter in the ResizeImage node determines whether to calculate and return the average color of the image. This is useful for creating simplified representations or making design decisions based on color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the ResizeImage node provide?",
        "answer": "The ResizeImage node provides the following output types: 'image', 'average_image', 'average_hex', and 'mask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'mask' output type used in the ResizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output type in the ResizeImage node provides the resized mask image. It is particularly useful when the node is used to manipulate and refine the visibility of specific regions within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the ResizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the ResizeImage node is CPU."
