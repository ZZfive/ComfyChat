        "question": "What is the purpose of the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is designed to convert a batch of latent representations into a single flat grid layout. This operation is useful for collectively visualizing and processing multiple latent samples by spatially rearranging them into a unified structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is 'latents', which represents a batch of latent samples that will be arranged into a grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is 'latent', which is a single latent representation presented in a grid form, containing the rearranged input latent batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node arrange the latent samples into a grid?",
        "answer": "The FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node calculates the length in tiles by taking the square root of the number of latent samples and rounding up. It then creates a new latent tensor with dimensions based on the calculated length in tiles. The latent samples are then placed into the grid using row and column indexes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node?",
        "answer": "The category of the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is 'Bmad/latent'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the FlatLatentsIntoSingleGrid node is not an output node."
