        "question": "What is the purpose of the IterativeLatentUpscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IterativeLatentUpscale node in ComfyUI is designed to gradually upscale the latent representation of a sample through a specified number of iterative steps. It intelligently applies an upscaling factor to enhance the resolution in the latent space, potentially leading to improved detail in the upscaled output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the IterativeLatentUpscale node are 'samples', 'upscale_factor', 'steps', and 'upscaler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'upscale_factor' parameter influence the output of the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_factor' parameter determines the extent to which the latent samples will be upscaled. It is a key factor in controlling the final resolution of the upscaled output. This parameter allows fine-tuning of the scale of the latent space to meet the desired output size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'steps' parameter play in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter defines the number of iterative upscaling steps to be performed. It is important because it determines the granularity of the iterative process, allowing for a more controlled and gradual enhancement of the latent space. Increasing the number of steps can result in smoother, more refined upscaling results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'temp_prefix' parameter in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'temp_prefix' parameter is used to specify a prefix for temporary files that may be created during the upscaling process. While not required, it can be useful for organizing or identifying intermediate files, especially in complex workflows involving multiple nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the IterativeLatentUpscale node are 'latent' and 'vae'. 'latent' represents the upscaled latent representation produced by the iterative process, and 'vae' provides the variational autoencoder (VAE) model associated with the upscaled latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the IterativeLatentUpscale node is GPU."
