        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Get_image_size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_image_size node is designed to calculate and return the dimensions of an image, specifically its width and height. It simplifies the complexity of handling image data structures by providing a straightforward method to obtain image size information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image' parameter in the DF_Get_image_size node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial in the DF_Get_image_size node as it represents the image data that will be used to determine the dimensions. This parameter directly affects the node's ability to compute and return the correct image size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the DF_Get_image_size node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the DF_Get_image_size node are WIDTH and HEIGHT. WIDTH represents the width of the image in pixels, and HEIGHT represents the height of the image in pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DF_Get_image_size node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DF_Get_image_size node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DF_Get_image_size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the DF_Get_image_size node in ComfyUI is Derfuu_Nodes/Functions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Get_image_size node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Get_image_size node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the FUNCTION attribute represent in the DF_Get_image_size class?",
        "answer": "The FUNCTION attribute in the DF_Get_image_size class represents the method used to compute the size of the image, which is 'get_size'."
