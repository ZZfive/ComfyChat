        "question": "What is the purpose of the Add String To Many node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Add String To Many node in ComfyUI is designed to append or prepend a given string to multiple other strings, enabling batch processing of strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Add String To Many node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Add String To Many node are 'to_add' (the string to be added), 'inputs_len' (the number of input strings), and 'operation' (whether to append or prepend the string)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'to_add' input represent in the Add String To Many node?",
        "answer": "In the Add String To Many node, the 'to_add' input represents the string that will be appended or prepended to each input string. It plays a core role in the operation, determining the content to be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'inputs_len' input affect the Add String To Many node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' input in the Add String To Many node specifies the number of input strings to which the 'to_add' string will be appended or prepended. It influences the number of times the node performs the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'operation' input in the Add String To Many node?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' input in the Add String To Many node determines whether the 'to_add' string will be appended or prepended to the input strings. This choice affects the arrangement of the final strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Add String To Many node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Add String To Many node is 'string', which represents the resulting strings after appending or prepending the 'to_add' string to each input string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Add String To Many node use?",
        "answer": "The Add String To Many node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
