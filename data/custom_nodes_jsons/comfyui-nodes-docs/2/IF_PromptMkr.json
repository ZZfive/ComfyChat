        "question": "What is the purpose of the IF_PromptMkr node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IF_PromptMkr node in ComfyUI is designed to convert input prompts into more detailed or stylized prompts by utilizing various AI engines and custom options. It enriches the original prompt by adding modifiers, styles, or negations based on user-defined parameters, with the goal of generating more impactful and context-rich prompts for creative or analytical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IF_PromptMkr node include: input_prompt, base_ip, port, engine, selected_model, profile, embellish_prompt, style_prompt, neg_prompt, and temperature."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'embellish_prompt' parameter do in the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The 'embellish_prompt' parameter in the IF_PromptMkr node is an optional parameter used to add extra descriptive elements to the input prompt, enhancing its detail or thematic depth."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'temperature' parameter affect the output of the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The 'temperature' parameter in the IF_PromptMkr node controls the creativity or randomness of the generated output. Higher values allow for more diverse responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the IF_PromptMkr node are: Question, which is the original input prompt returned unchanged; Response, which is the enriched or stylized prompt generated based on the input prompt and custom options; and Negative, which is the prompt with negations or constraints generated based on the neg_prompt parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which AI engines can be selected for processing input prompts in the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The AI engines that can be selected for processing input prompts in the IF_PromptMkr node include ollama, openai, and anthropic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'keep_alive' parameter in the IF_PromptMkr node?",
        "answer": "The 'keep_alive' parameter in the IF_PromptMkr node determines whether the AI model remains loaded after generating the output, affecting response time and resource usage."
