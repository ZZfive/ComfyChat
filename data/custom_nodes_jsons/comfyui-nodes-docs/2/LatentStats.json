        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentStats node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentStats node in ComfyUI is designed to analyze and report statistical data of latent representations in neural network models. It calculates and prints various statistical metrics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for different components of the latent space, providing in-depth insights into the characteristics of the data being processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the LatentStats node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the LatentStats node is 'latent', which represents the latent representation to be analyzed. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly affects the statistical calculations and the final output results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LatentStats node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the LatentStats node include 'stats', 'c0_mean', 'c1_mean', 'c2_mean', and 'c3_mean'. 'stats' is a string summarizing the statistical analysis of the latent representation, while 'c0_mean', 'c1_mean', 'c2_mean', and 'c3_mean' are float values representing the mean of the first, second, third, and fourth components of the latent representation, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LatentStats node use?",
        "answer": "The LatentStats node uses the 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the LatentStats node an output node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the LatentStats node is an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the LatentStats node belong to?",
        "answer": "The LatentStats node belongs to the 'utils' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the LatentStats node do?",
        "answer": "The source code of the LatentStats node defines the input and output types, category, and functionality of the node. It analyzes the latent representation, calculates statistical metrics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for different components, and returns a summary string and the mean values of the components."
