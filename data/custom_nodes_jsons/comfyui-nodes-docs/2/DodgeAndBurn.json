        "question": "What is the purpose of the DodgeAndBurn node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DodgeAndBurn node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance images by selectively brightening or darkening specific areas using dodge and burn techniques, creating depth and drawing attention to particular regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the DodgeAndBurn node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the DodgeAndBurn node are: image (the base layer to be modified), mask (determines which areas of the image will be affected), intensity (controls the degree of brightening or darkening applied), and mode (determines the specific dodge and burn technique to be used)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node specifies the specific dodge and burn technique to be applied, such as 'dodge', 'burn', 'dodge_and_burn', 'burn_and_dodge', 'color_dodge', 'color_burn', 'linear_dodge', or 'linear_burn', each affecting the image adjustment differently."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DodgeAndBurn node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DodgeAndBurn node is the modified image (output_image) that reflects the adjustments made to the original image based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'intensity' parameter affect the dodge and burn process in the DodgeAndBurn node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node controls the degree of brightening or darkening applied to the image, affecting the overall impact of the dodge and burn techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node determines which areas of the image will be affected by the dodge and burn process, playing a crucial role in controlling the precision of the adjustments made to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available modes for the 'mode' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node?",
        "answer": "The available modes for the 'mode' parameter in the DodgeAndBurn node are 'dodge', 'burn', 'dodge_and_burn', 'burn_and_dodge', 'color_dodge', 'color_burn', 'linear_dodge', and 'linear_burn', each offering a different approach to adjusting the image."
