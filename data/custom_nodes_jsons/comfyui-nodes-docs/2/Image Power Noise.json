        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Power_Noise class in ComfyUI is designed to generate various types of noise patterns that can be used for image processing or as digital textures. It provides the functionality to create white, grey, pink, green, blue, or mixed noise based on specified parameters like width, height, frequency, and attenuation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class are width and height, which define the dimensions of the noise image to be generated. These parameters are essential as they determine the horizontal and vertical resolution of the output image, affecting the overall detail and aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class include frequency, attenuation, noise_type, and seed. Frequency adjusts the scale of the noise patterns, attenuation affects the contrast of the noise, noise_type specifies the type of noise to be generated (grey, white, pink, blue, green, or mix), and seed ensures the reproducibility of the noise pattern by initializing the random number generator."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class is an image, representing the generated noise pattern in a visual format. It encapsulates the specified noise characteristics and is the primary result of the power_noise method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is specified for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type specified for the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class is CPU, indicating that the computations are performed on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class handle unsupported noise types?",
        "answer": "If an unsupported noise type is provided to the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class, it prints an error message using cstr and returns None, indicating that the specified noise type is not supported."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the blue_noise_mask function in the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class?",
        "answer": "The blue_noise_mask function in the WAS_Image_Power_Noise class is used to generate multiple blue noise masks based on the provided width, height, frequency, attenuation, and seed values. These masks are then used in the blend_noise function to create a mixed noise pattern."
