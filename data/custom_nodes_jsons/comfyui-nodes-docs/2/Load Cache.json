        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the WAS_Load_Cache node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the WAS_Load_Cache node is to efficiently manage loading cached data, such as latent vectors, images, and conditioning data, from specified paths, providing an essential data retrieval mechanism for workflows within the WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the `latent_path` parameter required for the WAS_Load_Cache node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the `latent_path` parameter is required for the WAS_Load_Cache node, as it specifies the file path for the latent data cache, guiding the node to the correct location to load the latent data which is essential for subsequent processing steps in the WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image_path` parameter in the WAS_Load_Cache node specify?",
        "answer": "The `image_path` parameter in the WAS_Load_Cache node is used to indicate the location of the image data cache. It is an optional parameter that, when provided, allows the node to load and use image data from the specified path, enhancing the functionality of the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `conditioning_path` parameter in the WAS_Load_Cache node?",
        "answer": "The `conditioning_path` parameter in the WAS_Load_Cache node points to the file path that stores the conditioning data cache. This optional parameter is important when the node needs to load conditioning data to influence the generation or processing of other data within the WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of data does the LATENT output of the WAS_Load_Cache node provide?",
        "answer": "The LATENT output of the WAS_Load_Cache node provides the latent data that has been loaded from the specified cache path. It is a crucial component for models within the WAS Suite that require latent representations for operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what conditions does the IMAGE output of the WAS_Load_Cache node appear?",
        "answer": "The IMAGE output of the WAS_Load_Cache node, which contains the loaded image data, appears only when the corresponding `image_path` input is provided and the image data is successfully loaded. This output can be used for visualization or further analysis within the WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the CONDITIONING output in the WAS_Load_Cache node?",
        "answer": "The CONDITIONING output in the WAS_Load_Cache node provides the loaded conditioning data, which is crucial for certain model operations within the WAS Suite. It allows for customization and fine-tuning of model behavior based on conditional inputs."
