        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Logical_NOT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_NOT node is designed to apply a logical NOT operation to a Boolean input. It reverses the truth value, providing a simple mechanism for negating Boolean conditions in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Logical_NOT node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter is the key input for the WAS_Logical_NOT node. It is a Boolean value that the node will negate. The importance of this parameter lies in its ability to control the logical state of subsequent operations, which is crucial for conditional workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output of the WAS_Logical_NOT node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output of the WAS_Logical_NOT node represents the logical NOT of the input Boolean value. Its significance lies in directly influencing the logical flow in the system, allowing the construction of complex conditional statements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the WAS_Logical_NOT node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the WAS_Logical_NOT node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Logical_NOT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_Logical_NOT node in ComfyUI is WAS Suite/Logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input and output data types of the WAS_Logical_NOT node?",
        "answer": "The input data type of the WAS_Logical_NOT node is BOOLEAN (Comfy dtype) or bool (Python dtype). The output data type is also BOOLEAN (Comfy dtype) or bool (Python dtype)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the WAS_Logical_NOT node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the WAS_Logical_NOT node is not an output node."
