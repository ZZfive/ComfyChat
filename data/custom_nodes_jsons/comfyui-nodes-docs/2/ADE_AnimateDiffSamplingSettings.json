        "question": "What is the purpose of the `create_settings` method in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `create_settings` method in the `SampleSettingsNode` class is designed to configure and generate sampling settings for the animation process. It encapsulates parameters that define noise generation behavior, iteration options, and other customizable aspects of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `batch_offset` parameter in the `SampleSettingsNode` class control?",
        "answer": "The `batch_offset` parameter in the `SampleSettingsNode` class is crucial for managing batch processing of noise generation. It allows the system to offset the batch index, which may be essential for ensuring unique noise patterns between different batches."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `noise_type` parameter influence the sampling process in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `noise_type` parameter determines the type of noise layer used in the sampling process. It is a key factor in forming the characteristics of the generated noise, which in turn influences the overall quality and style of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `seed_gen` parameter play in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `seed_gen` parameter decides the method of seed generation for the noise layers. It is important for ensuring consistency and repeatability of the generated noise patterns. This parameter is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the noise generation process across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `seed_override` parameter in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `seed_override` parameter allows for manual overriding of the default seed value used for noise generation. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where a specific noise pattern is required or when replicating the results of a previous run."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `adapt_denoise_steps` parameter affect the sampling process in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `adapt_denoise_steps` parameter is a boolean flag that, when set to true, allows the system to adaptively adjust denoise steps during the sampling process. This can lead to more effective and efficient noise reduction, improving the overall quality of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `custom_cfg` parameter in the `SampleSettingsNode` class?",
        "answer": "The `custom_cfg` parameter allows for the application of custom configuration keyframes to the sampling process. This provides a way to introduce specific creative adjustments and fine-tune the animation to meet unique project requirements."
