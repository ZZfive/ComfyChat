        "question": "What is the purpose of the LMStudioPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LMStudioPrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the generation of prompts for AI text-to-image models. It processes input prompts through various modes such as 'prompt', 'style', 'descriptor', and 'character' to enrich the prompts with detailed descriptions that guide the AI model's image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LMStudioPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LMStudioPrompt node are 'input_prompt', which directly influences the content and direction of the AI-generated images, and 'mode', which determines how the node processes the input prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'custom_history' parameter function in the LMStudioPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'custom_history' parameter is important when the mode is set to 'custom'. It allows users to provide a path to a history file, which the node uses to generate responses. This feature enables the node to access external data sources for a more personalized or context-aware prompt generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seed' parameter in the LMStudioPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the results produced by the LMStudioPrompt node are reproducible. This is particularly useful for debugging or when consistent results are expected across multiple runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the LMStudioPrompt node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the LMStudioPrompt node contains the processed prompt result. It is a detailed description generated based on the input prompt and selected mode, which can be directly used as input for AI text-to-image models to create images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LMStudioPrompt node integrate with external servers?",
        "answer": "The LMStudioPrompt node integrates with external servers through the 'server_address' and 'server_port' parameters. These parameters specify the server address and port number that the node will communicate with to send and receive data, which is particularly useful when the node needs to interact with external services or applications to process prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what coding language is the source code of the LMStudioPrompt node written?",
        "answer": "The source code of the LMStudioPrompt node is written in Python."
