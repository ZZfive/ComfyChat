        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch node is designed to select and output one of the provided latent representations based on a given selection index, enabling dynamic switching between latent inputs in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Latent Switch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Latent Switch node is 'select', which determines which latent representation to output based on its numeric index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Latent Switch node are 'latent_i' (where i ranges from 1 to 5), representing the latent representation options that can be selected for output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Latent Switch node is 'latent_out', which is the selected latent representation based on the input selection index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Latent Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch node belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Latent Switch node determine which latent representation to output?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch node determines which latent representation to output based on the value of the 'select' input parameter, which serves as the selection index."
