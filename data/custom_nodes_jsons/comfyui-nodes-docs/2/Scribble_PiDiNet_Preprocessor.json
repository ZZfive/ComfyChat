        "question": "What is the purpose of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is used to preprocess images using the PiDiNet model to extract scribble lines, enhancing the image for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the PiDiNet model used in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the PiDiNet model in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is to generate clear, scribble-like lines from the input image, suitable for applications requiring stylized line drawings or sketches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed for scribble line extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'safe' parameter do in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' parameter in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is an optional mode that, when enabled, applies additional safety checks or constraints during processing to ensure robustness."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node determines the resolution to which the input image is scaled before processing, affecting the level of detail in the extracted lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is an image, which is the processed image containing enhanced scribble lines suitable for visualization or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is GPU."
