        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemoveControlNet __Inspire node in ComfyUI is designed to remove the ControlNet from the region prompts in a given dataset. It processes each region prompt, extracts the positive and negative condition texts, applies a procedure to remove the ControlNet from these texts, and then reassembles the prompt with the updated conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The RemoveControlNet __Inspire node requires an input type of 'conditioning', which is the conditional data from which the ControlNet influence needs to be removed. This process aims to purify the condition for subsequent use, ensuring it does not contain specific ControlNet attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is 'conditioning'. This is the conditional data that has had the ControlNet removed. The output has been purified and no longer contains the influence of the previously specified ControlNet, making it suitable for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'infra type' for the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'infra type' for the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node belong?",
        "answer": "The RemoveControlNet __Inspire node belongs to the 'InspirePack/Util' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the source code of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the source code of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is 'doit'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'doit' function in the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node do?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' function in the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node processes the input conditioning data, removes the ControlNet from the condition texts, and returns the purified conditioning data without the ControlNet influence."
