        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargePipelineStart node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargePipelineStart node is the starting point of a data processing pipeline in ComfyUI. It is responsible for initializing the pipeline with the given workflow version and optional data stream, ensuring that the pipeline is properly set up with the correct settings and configurations before processing begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SeargePipelineStart node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the SeargePipelineStart node is 'wf_version', which specifies the workflow version to be used by the pipeline. This is crucial for determining the correct settings and operations that the pipeline will execute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'data' parameter represent in the SeargePipelineStart node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter represents an optional data stream that can be input into the pipeline. It may contain initial data necessary for processing and is essential for the pipeline to produce meaningful results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'additional_data' parameter in the SeargePipelineStart node?",
        "answer": "The 'additional_data' parameter provides a way to supply extra data to the pipeline. This can be used to enrich the main data stream with additional information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prompt' parameter do in the SeargePipelineStart node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter is used to provide a text prompt that may guide the processing within the pipeline. It is often hidden and typically used for internal guidance rather than direct processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the SeargePipelineStart node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter is used for additional information related to PNG images that the pipeline may process. It is optional and can contain metadata or other relevant details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SeargePipelineStart node output?",
        "answer": "The SeargePipelineStart node outputs the initialized data stream after the pipeline has been started. This includes any modifications or settings applied by the node and serves as the basis for further processing within the pipeline."
