        "question": "What is the purpose of the AspectRatioSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AspectRatioSelector node is designed to select and adjust the aspect ratio of images based on predefined options. It simplifies the process of resizing images to specific dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what categories is the AspectRatioSelector node particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The AspectRatioSelector node is particularly useful in image processing and layout design, allowing for quick implementation of standardized image size adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the AspectRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The AspectRatioSelector node requires the input type 'aspect_ratio', which specifies the desired image aspect ratio from a predefined list of common ratios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the AspectRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the AspectRatioSelector node are 'ratio', 'width', and 'height'. 'ratio' returns the selected aspect ratio as a string, 'width' returns the calculated width of the adjusted image, and 'height' returns the calculated height of the adjusted image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the width of the image calculated in the AspectRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The width of the image is calculated by applying a scale ratio to the width based on the selected aspect ratio and then rounding it to the nearest multiple of 8."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the height of the image calculated in the AspectRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The height of the image is calculated by applying a scale ratio to the height based on the selected aspect ratio and then rounding it to the nearest multiple of 8."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the AspectRatioSelector node use?",
        "answer": "The AspectRatioSelector node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
