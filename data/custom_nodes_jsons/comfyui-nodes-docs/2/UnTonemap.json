        "question": "What is the purpose of the UnTonemap node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node in ComfyUI is designed to reverse the tone mapping effect on images, converting images that have undergone tone mapping back to their original linear or sRGB color space. This process is crucial for restoring the original dynamic range and color fidelity of images that have been tone mapped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the UnTonemap node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the UnTonemap node include: images (the images to be processed), input_mode (specifying the color space of the input images, either 'sRGB' or 'linear'), output_mode (defining the desired color space of the output images, either 'linear' or 'sRGB'), and tonemap_scale (the scale factor applied during the inverse tone mapping process to adjust the intensity of the effect)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_mode' parameter in the UnTonemap node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'input_mode' parameter in the UnTonemap node specifies the color space of the input images. It can be either 'sRGB' or 'linear', determining the initial conversion step before performing the inverse tone mapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_mode' parameter in the UnTonemap node define?",
        "answer": "The 'output_mode' parameter in the UnTonemap node defines the desired color space of the output images after the inverse tone mapping. It can be either 'linear' or 'sRGB', affecting the final conversion step after the inverse tone mapping is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the UnTonemap node?",
        "answer": "The 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the UnTonemap node is the scale factor applied during the inverse tone mapping process. It is used to adjust the intensity of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the UnTonemap node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the UnTonemap node is an image. The returned image is the result after the inverse tone mapping process, in the specified output color space ('linear' or 'sRGB')."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the UnTonemap node commonly run?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node commonly runs on the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
