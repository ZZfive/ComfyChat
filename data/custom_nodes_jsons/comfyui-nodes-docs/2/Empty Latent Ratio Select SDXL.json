        "question": "What is the purpose of the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EmptyLatentRatioSelector node is designed to generate latent representations for a given set of ratio sizes. It plays a crucial role in the initial stages of latent space operations, providing a structured starting point for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ratio_selected' parameter in the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The 'ratio_selected' parameter is essential for determining the specific ratio size used for latent generation. It defines the dimensions of the latent space and is a fundamental aspect of the node's operation, directly influencing the structure of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter in the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node control?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter allows specifying the number of latent samples generated in a single operation. It is an optional parameter that can be adjusted based on computational resources and specific requirements of the task at hand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' output parameter represent in the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' output parameter represents the generated latent representations. It is a tensor containing information about the latent space, which is crucial for subsequent processing and analysis in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node generate latent representations?",
        "answer": "The EmptyLatentRatioSelector node generates latent representations by creating a tensor of zeros with dimensions based on the selected ratio size and batch size. The width and height of the tensor are determined by the 'ratio_dict' attribute and the selected ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node's 'generate' function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the EmptyLatentRatioSelector node's 'generate' function is a tuple containing a dictionary with the 'samples' key mapped to the generated latent tensor."
