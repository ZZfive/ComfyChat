        "question": "What is the purpose of the ClipClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ClipClamp node in ComfyUI is designed to process CLIP data without modification, acting as a placeholder or checkpoint in the data processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ClipClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ClipClamp node is 'clip', which is the CLIP data that this node processes. It acts as a pass-through, ensuring that the CLIP data remains unchanged within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the 'clip' input in the ClipClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the 'clip' input in the ClipClamp node is 'CLIP'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'clip' input in the ClipClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'clip' input in the ClipClamp node is 'tuple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ClipClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ClipClamp node is 'clip', which returns the unmodified CLIP data, maintaining its integrity for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the output of the ClipClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the output of the ClipClamp node is 'CLIP'."
