        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageDrawArc node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawArc node in ComfyUI is used to draw arcs on an image. It utilizes dimensions, colors, and specific arc parameters to directly render arcs on a given image canvas, making it easy to create graphical representations and annotations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageDrawArc node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageDrawArc node include width, height, size, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, start, end, red, green, blue, alpha, SSAA, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter control in the ImageDrawArc node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter in the ImageDrawArc node determines the thickness of the arc."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SSAA parameter in the ImageDrawArc node?",
        "answer": "The SSAA parameter in the ImageDrawArc node is the super-sampling anti-aliasing factor, which is used for higher quality rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the ImageDrawArc node return?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawArc node returns an image tensor with the drawn arc as the output type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ImageDrawArc node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ImageDrawArc node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the arc drawn on the image canvas in the source code of the ImageDrawArc node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the ImageDrawArc node, the arc is drawn on the image canvas using the ImageDraw.Draw() function and the arc() method, which takes the start and end coordinates, start and end angles, color, and size as parameters."
