        "question": "What is the purpose of the Create CameraCtrl Poses node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Create CameraCtrl Poses node is designed to create basic camera control poses based on specified motion type, speed, and frame length, allowing for dynamic and customizable animations in a 3D environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node are motion_type (COMBO[STRING]), speed (FLOAT), and frame_length (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'motion_type' input specify in the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The 'motion_type' input specifies the type of motion to be applied to the camera, influencing the direction and nature of the camera movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'speed' input determine in the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The 'speed' input determines the speed of the camera movement, allowing control over the pacing of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_length' input define in the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_length' input defines the number of frames over which the camera motion is applied, setting the duration of the camera movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node is prev_poses (CAMERACTRL_POSES), which provides previous camera poses to be combined with the newly generated poses for seamless transitions between animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Create CameraCtrl Poses node is cameractrl_poses (CAMERACTRL_POSES), which represents the generated camera control poses ready for animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the Create CameraCtrl Poses node is CPU."
