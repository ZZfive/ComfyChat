        "question": "What is the purpose of the JitterImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JitterImage node in ComfyUI is used to simulate camera or object motion by applying a series of affine transformations to the image, resulting in a jitter effect on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JitterImage node are 'images' (the input image to which the jitter effect will be applied) and 'jitter_scale' (which defines the scale of the jitter effect and adjusts the intensity of the transformation applied to the image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JitterImage node is 'image', which represents the output image after the jitter effect has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JitterImage node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what does the 'jitter' function do?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'jitter' function applies the jitter effect to the input image by creating a series of affine transformations based on the 'jitter_scale' and applying them to the image using 'grid_sample'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'jitter_scale' parameter?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'jitter_scale' parameter is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum value and step size for the 'jitter_scale' parameter?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'jitter_scale' parameter is 0.1, and the step size is 0.1."
