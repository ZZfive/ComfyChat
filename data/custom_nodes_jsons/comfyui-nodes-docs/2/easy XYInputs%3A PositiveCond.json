        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node is designed to handle positive conditional inputs for XY charts, allowing users to specify positive scenario conditions that influence the chart's axes and values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'i' in 'positive_i' represent in the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'i' in 'positive_i' represents the index of the positive condition, ranging from 1 to 4. Each condition modifies the chart's axes and values incrementally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node is 'X_Y', which represents the configured axes and values of the chart reflecting the applied positive conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node use?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node handle the application of multiple positive conditions?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node applies multiple positive conditions incrementally, modifying the chart's axes and values based on the specified conditions, allowing for a layered approach to customizing the chart's appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'xy_value' function in the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'xy_value' function in the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node returns a tuple containing a dictionary with keys 'axis', 'values', and 'cond', representing the configured axes, values, and applied conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: PositiveCond node is classified under the 'EasyUse/XY Inputs' category in ComfyUI."
