        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is designed to remove data entries associated with a specific numeric key from the backend cache, ensuring data integrity and optimizing storage space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'key' parameter in the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' parameter is crucial for identifying the exact data entry to be removed from the cache. It serves as the unique identifier for the target data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is accepted for the 'key' parameter in the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' parameter accepts an integer (INT) data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to the int data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'signal_opt' parameter in the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal_opt' parameter provides flexibility during the removal process by allowing additional options to be specified for the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node outputs the 'signal_opt' parameter, which reflects any additional options or signals provided as input, maintaining the integrity of the operation context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node handle cases where the provided key is not found in the cache?",
        "answer": "If the provided key is not found in the cache, the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node prints a message indicating that the data key is invalid."
