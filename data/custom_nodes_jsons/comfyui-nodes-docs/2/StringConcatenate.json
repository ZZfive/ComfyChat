        "question": "What is the purpose of the StringConcatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StringConcatenate node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently concatenate strings with associated frame numbers. It plays a key role in creating structured data representations by combining text inputs and their corresponding frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the StringConcatenate node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the StringConcatenate node are 'text_a', 'frame_a', 'text_b', and 'frame_b'. 'text_a' and 'text_b' are mandatory string inputs representing the first and second texts to be concatenated, while 'frame_a' and 'frame_b' are integers specifying the associated frame numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the StringConcatenate node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the StringConcatenate node are 'text_c' and 'frame_c'. 'text_c' is an optional string input that can be included for further concatenation, providing flexibility to add more text content to the structured data. 'frame_c' is an optional integer that specifies a frame number if 'text_c' is provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the StringConcatenate node?",
        "answer": "The output of the StringConcatenate node is the 'result' parameter, which represents the concatenated string output. It is the result of combining all provided text inputs and their respective frame numbers into a single structured format."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StringConcatenate node handle multiline text inputs?",
        "answer": "The StringConcatenate node replaces newline characters ('\\n') with empty strings in the text inputs ('text_a', 'text_b', 'text_c', etc.) to ensure that the concatenated string output is properly formatted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the StringConcatenate node?",
        "answer": "The StringConcatenate node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code of StringConcatenate node, what is the purpose of the 'text_list' variable?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the StringConcatenate node, the 'text_list' variable is used to store the concatenated string output. It combines the provided text inputs and their respective frame numbers into a single structured format."
