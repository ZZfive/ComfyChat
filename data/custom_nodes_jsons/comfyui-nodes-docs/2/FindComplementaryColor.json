        "question": "What is the purpose of the FindComplementaryColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindComplementaryColor node in ComfyUI is designed to find a color complementary to the main color in an image based on a given color dictionary and a specified power factor. It can also optionally apply a mask to focus the search on specific areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the FindComplementaryColor node are: an image to find the complementary color in, a color dictionary mapping color names to their RGB values, and a power factor that influences the sensitivity or preference of the algorithm to certain colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the FindComplementaryColor node is a mask that can be applied to the image to restrict the search for complementary colors to specific areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the FindComplementaryColor node are: a list of integers representing the RGB values of the found complementary color, and a string representing the name of the found complementary color according to the input color dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FindComplementaryColor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FindComplementaryColor node handle mismatched image and mask sizes?",
        "answer": "If the image and mask sizes don't match, the FindComplementaryColor node will resize the image to fit the mask using linear interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the valid data types for the 'color_dict' input in the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The valid data types for the 'color_dict' input in the FindComplementaryColor node are COLOR_DICT in ComfyUI and Dict[str, Tuple[int, int, int]] in Python."
