        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptImage node in ComfyUI is designed to process and manipulate images based on text prompts. It takes prompts and images as inputs and generates a series of image outputs influenced by the input prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PromptImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PromptImage node are 'prompts', 'images', and 'save_to_image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prompts' parameter in the PromptImage node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'prompts' parameter in the PromptImage node provides the text content that guides the image processing. Each prompt is associated with a set of images and influences the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' parameter in the PromptImage node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the PromptImage node is the fundamental input that contains the image data to be processed. It is expected to be a list of image tensors that the node will operate on based on the provided prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'save_to_image' parameter in the PromptImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'save_to_image' parameter in the PromptImage node determines whether the processed images should be saved to the output directory. It allows users to enable or disable the saving functionality as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the PromptImage node?",
        "answer": "The output of the PromptImage node includes the 'ui' parameter, which contains user interface elements displaying the processed images and their associated prompts. It provides a structured way to present the results for further interaction or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the PromptImage node?",
        "answer": "The PromptImage node requires a CPU infra type for its execution."
