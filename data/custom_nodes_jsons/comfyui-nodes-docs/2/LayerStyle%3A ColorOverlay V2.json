        "question": "What is cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "cg-noise is a custom node in ComfyUI that replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced. It allows for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Using cg-noise in ComfyUI allows for exploring small variations of the same image without having to change the sampler or significantly alter the prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does cg-noise support negative prompts?",
        "answer": "Yes, cg-noise supports negative prompts, which can be used to specify aspects or elements that should not be included in the generated variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the variations generated by cg-noise be controlled?",
        "answer": "The variations generated by cg-noise can be controlled by adjusting the weight `x` and the `variation_seed`. Increasing the weight `x` will give more influence to the `variation_seed` in generating the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is cg-noise compatible with existing prompts and styles in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, cg-noise is compatible with existing prompts and styles in ComfyUI. It can be seamlessly integrated into the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does cg-noise require any additional setup or configuration in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The provided text does not mention any specific setup or configuration requirements for using cg-noise in ComfyUI. It is likely that cg-noise can be used directly as a custom node without additional setup."
