        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Model node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Model node in ComfyUI is used for inspecting and analyzing the internal state and output of a model, providing a means to understand and debug the model's behavior during inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'input_data' parameter in the KfDebug_Model node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_data' parameter represents the sample or batch of samples being processed by the model. It directly influences the model's output and the insights gained from debugging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are accepted for the 'input_data' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'input_data' parameter accepts data of type COMBO[numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor] in ComfyUI and Union[numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the KfDebug_Model node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial as it defines the neural network architecture being debugged. The model's configuration and parameters determine the debugging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is accepted for the 'model' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter accepts data of type torch.nn.Module in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the KfDebug_Model node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfDebug_Model node is 'debug_info', which provides a detailed overview of the model's internal workings, helping identify potential issues and areas for improvement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'debug_info' output?",
        "answer": "The 'debug_info' output uses the Dict[str, Any] data type in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for the KfDebug_Model node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the KfDebug_Model node is GPU."
