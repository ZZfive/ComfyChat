        "question": "What is the purpose of the UnGridify (image) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnGridify (image) node in ComfyUI is designed to decompose a gridified image into its constituent sub-images or tiles, effectively reversing the process of assembling multiple small images into a single large grid image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the UnGridify (image) node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the UnGridify (image) node are the image to be decomposed into tiles, the number of columns in the grid, and the number of rows in the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'columns' input determine in the UnGridify (image) node?",
        "answer": "The 'columns' input determines how the image will be segmented in the horizontal direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rows' input determine in the UnGridify (image) node?",
        "answer": "The 'rows' input determines how the image will be segmented in the vertical direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the UnGridify (image) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the UnGridify (image) node is a list of tiles extracted from the grid image, where each tile is a small part of the original grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the UnGridify (image) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the UnGridify (image) node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the UnGridify (image) node decompose the gridified image?",
        "answer": "The UnGridify (image) node decomposes the gridified image by iterating over the rows and columns of the grid and extracting tiles of size (tile_height, tile_width) from the original image."
