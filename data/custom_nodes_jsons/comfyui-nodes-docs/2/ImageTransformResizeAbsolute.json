        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node in ComfyUI is used to resize a batch of images to a specified absolute size using various interpolation methods. It provides precise control over the output size of the images and is suitable for tasks that require uniform image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node are: images (the batch of images to be resized), width (the target width of the resized images), height (the target height of the resized images), and method (the interpolation method used for resizing)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node is 'image', which represents the resized images as a batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What interpolation methods are available for resizing images in the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The available interpolation methods in the ImageTransformResizeAbsolute node are: lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest."
