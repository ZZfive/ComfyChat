        "question": "What is the purpose of the Range(Step) - Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Int node in ComfyUI is used to generate integer sequences within a specified range, allowing users to control the start value, stop value, and step size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Range(Step) - Int node are: start (the starting value of the range), stop (the ending value of the range), step (the interval between each number in the sequence), and end_mode (whether the stop value is inclusive or exclusive)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the end_mode parameter in the Range(Step) - Int node specify?",
        "answer": "The end_mode parameter in the Range(Step) - Int node specifies whether the stop value is inclusive or exclusive, allowing for flexibility in defining the boundaries of the integer sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Range(Step) - Int node are: range (the generated integer sequence) and range_sizes (the size of each generated integer sequence)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the Range(Step) - Int node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the Range(Step) - Int node support input and output as lists?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Range(Step) - Int node supports input and output as lists. The INPUT_IS_LIST and OUTPUT_IS_LIST parameters are set to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Range(Step) - Int node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Int node belongs to the 'List Stuff' category in ComfyUI."
