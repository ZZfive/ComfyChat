        "question": "What does the input parameter 'pipe' represent?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline configuration, including the model, positive and negative prompts, other settings, and more. It serves as the foundation for the pre-sampling process."

        "question": "What are the implementation details of the 'sample_inversed_euler' function?",
        "answer": "The 'sample_inversed_euler' function implements Algorithm 2 (Euler steps) from the paper 'Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Adversarial Universality' by Alekh Agarwal et al. (2022). It takes the name of the model, a vector of tensors representing inputs (x), a list of sigma values (sigmas), and additional arguments (extra_args) as inputs. It returns a vector of tensors (x) that represents the sampled outputs after performing the Euler steps."

        "question": "What is the core functionality of the easy preSamplingCustom node?",
        "answer": "The core functionality of the easy preSamplingCustom node is to provide customization options for the pre-sampling stage in ComfyUI, allowing users to define conditions and parameters that affect the sampling dynamics of the underlying diffusion model. This enables users to control factors such as the guide strategy, noise levels, and sampling steps, optimizing the image generation process."
