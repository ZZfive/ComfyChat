        "question": "What is the purpose of the PoseNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PoseNode in ComfyUI is designed to process images to generate their pose representation. It utilizes image processing techniques to convert the image into a format suitable for pose analysis, abstracting the complexity of image operations and transformations in the pose detection task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the PoseNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the PoseNode is 'image'. It specifies the image file to be used for pose detection and serves as the primary input source for exporting pose information in the node operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'image' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'image' input parameter is COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'image' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input parameter is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the PoseNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the PoseNode is 'image'. It represents the processed image in a tensor format suitable for further analysis or visualization in pose detection tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output 'image'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output 'image' is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output 'image'?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output 'image' is torch.Tensor."
