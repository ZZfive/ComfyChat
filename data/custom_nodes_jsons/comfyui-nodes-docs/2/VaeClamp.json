        "question": "What is the purpose of the VaeClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node is designed to pass through the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model without any modifications. It serves as a utility in the processing pipeline, ensuring compatibility or enforcing constraints without altering the VAE model itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the VaeClamp node is 'vae', which is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. The node takes this model as input and returns it unchanged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'vae' input in the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'vae' input in the VaeClamp node is VAE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'vae' input in the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'vae' input in the VaeClamp node is comfy.sd.VAE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node outputs the unchanged Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that was passed into the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output of the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the VaeClamp node is VAE."
