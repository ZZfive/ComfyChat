        "question": "What is the purpose of the M-LSDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The M-LSDPreprocessor node is used to extract line segments from images using the M-LSD (Multiple Line Segment Detector) model. It processes images to detect and delineate linear structures, which is crucial for various computer vision tasks that require understanding geometric shapes and boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the M-LSDPreprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed for line segment detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the score_threshold optional input parameter do in the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The score_threshold optional input parameter defines the confidence threshold for line segment detection. Higher values result in fewer detected line segments but with higher reliability."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the dist_threshold optional input parameter affect the output of the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The dist_threshold optional input parameter sets the distance threshold for separating line segments. Smaller values lead to finer segmentation of closely spaced lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the resolution optional input parameter in the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution optional input parameter specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before processing, affecting the scale of detected line segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the M-LSDPreprocessor node is an image with overlaid or highlighted detected line segments, facilitating further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the M-LSDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the M-LSDPreprocessor node is GPU."
