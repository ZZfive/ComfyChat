        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_LoRAStack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_LoRAStack node is designed to manage and combine multiple LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) layers into a single stack, allowing users to toggle the inclusion of each LoRA layer, set model weights, and clip weights to fine-tune the contribution of each layer to the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'switch_1' parameter in the CR_LoRAStack node control?",
        "answer": "The 'switch_1' parameter is a toggle that determines whether the first LoRA layer is included in the stack, playing a crucial role in controlling the composition of the final LoRA stack."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'model_weight_1' parameter affect the output in the CR_LoRAStack node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_weight_1' parameter adjusts the influence of the first LoRA layer on the final output, which is essential for fine-tuning the contribution of each layer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'clip_weight_1' parameter in the CR_LoRAStack node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_weight_1' parameter is used to clip or limit the weight of the first LoRA layer, preventing it from overly dominating the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'lora_name_2' parameter contribute to the functionality of the CR_LoRAStack node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name_2' parameter specifies the name of the second LoRA layer to be considered for inclusion in the stack, serving as a key factor in identifying the LoRA layers during the stacking process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_stack' parameter in the CR_LoRAStack node allow?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_stack' parameter allows the pre-population of the LoRA stack with existing layers, which is useful for continuing work from a previous state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the CR_LoRAStack node?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the CR_LoRAStack node is a list of tuples representing the stacked LoRA layers along with their corresponding weights and clip values, which is the main result of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_LoRAStack node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_LoRAStack node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
