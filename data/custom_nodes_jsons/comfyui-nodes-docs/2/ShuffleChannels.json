        "question": "What is the purpose of the ShuffleChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ShuffleChannels node is designed to manipulate the color channels of an image. It allows for reassigning color channels, including red, green, blue, and optionally alpha, to different color values or constant values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ShuffleChannels node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ShuffleChannels node include: the input image, and specifications for the red, green, blue, and alpha (optional) channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the 'image' input accept in the ShuffleChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input accepts data of type 'IMAGE' in ComfyUI and 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the 'red' input be mapped to in the ShuffleChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'red' input can be mapped to another color channel or set to a constant value."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'alpha' input mandatory in the ShuffleChannels node?",
        "answer": "No, the 'alpha' input is optional in the ShuffleChannels node. It can be mapped to another channel, set to a constant value, or left unchanged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ShuffleChannels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ShuffleChannels node is 'IMAGE' in ComfyUI and 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ShuffleChannels node use?",
        "answer": "The ShuffleChannels node uses the 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ShuffleChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ShuffleChannels node falls under the category 'image/filters' in ComfyUI."
