        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetLastImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the GetLastImage node is to extract the last image from a batch of images, ensuring that the output is the final visual representation in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the GetLastImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the GetLastImage node is 'images', which provides the batch of image data for the node to process and select the last image."
