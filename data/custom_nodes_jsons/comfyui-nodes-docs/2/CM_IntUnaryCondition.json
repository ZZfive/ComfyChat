        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntUnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntUnaryCondition node in ComfyUI is designed to evaluate a single integer based on a set of unary conditions. It serves as a fundamental building block for more complex mathematical operations, allowing the determination of whether an integer satisfies a specific condition without altering its value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IntUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The IntUnaryCondition node requires two input parameters: 'op' and 'a'. 'op' is a string that defines the unary condition to be checked on integer 'a', and 'a' is the integer that will be evaluated based on the unary condition specified by 'op'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the IntUnaryCondition node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the IntUnaryCondition node is a string that defines the unary condition to be checked on the integer 'a'. It is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the specific condition to be evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'a' parameter in the IntUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the IntUnaryCondition node represents the integer that will be evaluated based on the unary condition specified by the 'op' parameter. It is a fundamental input for the node as it is the object of the condition check."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IntUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output of the IntUnaryCondition node is a boolean value, indicating whether the integer 'a' satisfies the unary condition specified by 'op'. This result is important for decision-making processes in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the IntUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the IntUnaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the IntUnaryCondition node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the IntUnaryCondition node defines the input types, return types, function, category, and the operation to be performed on the input integer based on the specified unary condition."
