        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the LCMScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the LCMScheduler node is to generate a series of sigma values for diffusion models, which is crucial for controlling variance in sampling steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the LCMScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is essential as it represents the diffusion model that the scheduler will use to calculate sigma values, directly influencing the generated sigma schedule critical for subsequent steps in the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter affect the output of the LCMScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter determines the number of sigma values calculated by the scheduler. It significantly influences the granularity of the sigma schedule, affecting the quality and convergence of the diffusion sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigmas' output represent in the LCMScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigmas' output represents a series of sigma values generated by the scheduler, essential for the diffusion sampling process. Each sigma value corresponds to a specific step in the sampling, guiding the variance of noise to be added or removed at that step."

    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LCMScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The LCMScheduler node is recommended to run on a CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the LCMScheduler node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LCMScheduler node is classified in the 'sampling/custom_sampling/schedulers' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the LCMScheduler node to calculate sigma values?",
        "answer": "The LCMScheduler node uses the 'get_sigmas' function to calculate sigma values."
