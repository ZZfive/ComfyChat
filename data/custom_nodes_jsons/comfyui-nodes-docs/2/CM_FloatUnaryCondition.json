        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatUnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatUnaryCondition node is designed to evaluate a single-operand mathematical condition on a floating-point number. It provides a way to perform conditional checks, such as checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero, without having to implement the logic directly in code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FloatUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FloatUnaryCondition node are 'op', which defines the single-operand condition to be applied to the input floating-point number, and 'a', which represents the floating-point number on which the single-operand condition will be evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter determine in the FloatUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter determines the type of single-operand condition that will be applied to the input floating-point number. It is crucial as it decides the kind of check that will be performed on the input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FloatUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FloatUnaryCondition node is 'result', which is a boolean value indicating whether the single-operand condition applied to the input floating-point number is true or false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the FloatUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the FloatUnaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FloatUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The category of the FloatUnaryCondition node is 'math/float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the FloatUnaryCondition node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the FloatUnaryCondition node is not an output node."
