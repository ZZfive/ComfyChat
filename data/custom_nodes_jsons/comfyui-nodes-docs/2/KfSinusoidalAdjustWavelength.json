        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node in ComfyUI provides a way to adjust the wavelength of a sinusoidal curve, effectively changing its period without affecting other characteristics such as phase or amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input curve parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The input curve parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node is a required parameter that defines the base sinusoidal curve whose wavelength needs to be adjusted. It directly affects the input that the node processes and determines the starting characteristics of the curve before any adjustments are made."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the adjustment parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The adjustment parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node serves as a multiplier for the wavelength adjustment, allowing precise control over the degree of change applied to the curve. It plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the temporal characteristics of the sinusoidal curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node has two output types: 'curve' and 'sinusoidal_curve'. Both outputs represent the adjusted sinusoidal curve, reflecting the results of the node's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'curve' output in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' output in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node represents the adjusted sinusoidal curve, which is the result of the node's processing. It is important because it provides an updated curve that can be used for subsequent operations or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sinusoidal_curve' output in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'sinusoidal_curve' output in the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node is the same as the 'curve' output, providing the adjusted sinusoidal curve. It ensures that users can access the modified curve in its new form, suitable for integration into various workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the KfSinusoidalAdjustWavelength node is CPU."
