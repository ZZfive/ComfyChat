        "question": "What is the purpose of the BreakoutVec4 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node is designed to decompose a four-dimensional vector into its individual components, facilitating operations that require manipulating each element of a Vec4 object separately."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the BreakoutVec4 node belong to?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node belongs to the math/conversion category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the BreakoutVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node requires a single input 'a', which is the four-dimensional vector to be decomposed. The data type of 'a' in ComfyUI is VEC4, and in Python, it is Vec4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the BreakoutVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node outputs four separate floating-point numbers, each representing a component of the original Vec4 input. The output data type in ComfyUI is FLOAT, and in Python, it is a tuple of four floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the BreakoutVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the BreakoutVec4 node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec4 node is implemented as a class with a class method INPUT_TYPES() that defines the required input 'a' of type VEC4, and a RETURN_TYPES attribute that specifies the output as four FLOAT values. The FUNCTION attribute is set to 'op', and the CATEGORY is 'math/conversion'. The 'op' method takes a Vec4 'a' as input and returns a tuple of four floats representing the components of 'a'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' method in the BreakoutVec4 class do?",
        "answer": "The 'op' method in the BreakoutVec4 class takes a Vec4 'a' as input and returns a tuple of four floats representing the individual components of 'a', effectively decomposing the four-dimensional vector into its constituent parts."
