        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurvesMultiply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiply node is designed to perform element-wise multiplication of two given keyframe curves, effectively combining their respective values at corresponding keyframes. This operation is crucial for adjusting and manipulating the intensity or magnitude of animation curves in a non-linear manner, enhancing creative control in animation and simulation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfCurvesMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiply node requires two input parameters: 'curve_1' and 'curve_2', both of which are of the Comfy dtype KEYFRAMED_CURVE and Python dtype keyframed.Curve. 'curve_1' defines the initial keyframes and their associated values to be multiplied by the second curve, while 'curve_2' acts as the multiplier for adjusting the animation or effect defined by the first curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurvesMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfCurvesMultiply node is a new keyframe curve, represented by the 'result' parameter, which is the element-wise product of the two input curves. This resulting curve can be used to further refine animations or introduce new levels of complexity and detail in animation sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfCurvesMultiply node use?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiply node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfCurvesMultiply node perform the multiplication of the two input curves?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the KfCurvesMultiply node, the 'main' function takes two input curves, 'curve_1' and 'curve_2', creates deep copies of them, and then performs an element-wise multiplication using the expression 'curve_1 * curve_2'. The resulting curve is then returned as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the KfCurvesMultiply node's 'main' function?",
        "answer": "The 'main' function of the KfCurvesMultiply node returns a tuple containing a single element, which is the resulting keyframe curve of the element-wise multiplication of the two input curves. The return type is specified as ('KEYFRAMED_CURVE',) in the RETURN_TYPES class attribute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'forceInput' option in the INPUT_TYPES class method of the KfCurvesMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The 'forceInput' option is set to True for both 'curve_1' and 'curve_2' input parameters in the INPUT_TYPES class method. This option ensures that the user must provide input values for these parameters when using the KfCurvesMultiply node in ComfyUI, as they are essential for the node's functionality."
