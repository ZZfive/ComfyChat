        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node in ComfyUI provides a conditional switching mechanism for control nets, allowing users to select between two control nets based on an input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Input' parameter in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node is crucial for determining which control net to use. It specifies the index of the control net to be selected, thus deciding the internal execution flow of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'control_net1' parameter represent in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net1' parameter represents the first control net that the node can choose from. It plays an important role in the node's decision-making process when the 'Input' parameter is set to 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'control_net2' parameter in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net2' parameter represents the second control net that the node can choose from. It becomes relevant when the 'Input' parameter is set to 2, guiding the node's selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node provides two outputs: 'CONTROL_NET', which is the selected control net based on the input value, and 'show_help', a URL that offers additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_ControlNetInputSwitch node provides a URL that offers additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node. It is a secondary output that gives users access to the node's documentation."
