        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntNumber node in ComfyUI is used to classify and restrict numerical inputs to ensure the output falls within defined ranges and increments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IntNumber node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IntNumber node are 'number', 'min_value', 'max_value', and 'step', all of which are of the INT data type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'number' input represent in the IntNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' input represents the central input that the IntNumber node evaluates to ensure it falls within the specified minimum and maximum bounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IntNumber node handle input numbers that are outside the specified range?",
        "answer": "If the input number is lower than the specified 'min_value', it is restricted to this lower limit. If the input number exceeds the 'max_value', it is restricted to this upper limit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'step' input in the IntNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input represents the incremental value that the IntNumber node considers when adjusting the input number within the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IntNumber node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IntNumber node is a single integer value that has been restricted and adjusted to fall within the defined range and adhere to the specified incremental step."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the IntNumber node use for processing?",
        "answer": "The IntNumber node uses the CPU infrastructure type for processing."
