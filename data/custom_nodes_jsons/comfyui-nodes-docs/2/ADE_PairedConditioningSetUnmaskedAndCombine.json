        "question": "What is the purpose of the Set Unmasked Conds node in ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved?",
        "answer": "The Set Unmasked Conds node is designed to process and combine paired conditioning inputs, apply unmasking, and optionally transform them using a LoRA hook. It focuses on integrating default or baseline conditions with current conditions to enhance flexibility and control over the conditioning process for further processing or generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Set Unmasked Conds node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Set Unmasked Conds node are 'positive', 'negative', 'positive_DEFAULT', and 'negative_DEFAULT', all of which are of the CONDITIONING Comfy data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can be provided to the Set Unmasked Conds node?",
        "answer": "The Set Unmasked Conds node accepts an optional input 'opt_lora_hook' of the LORA_HOOK Comfy data type, which is an optional LoRA hook for transforming the conditioning inputs before combining them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Set Unmasked Conds node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Set Unmasked Conds node are 'positive' and 'negative', both of which are of the CONDITIONING Comfy data type, representing the combined positive and negative conditions after integrating the current and default inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Set Unmasked Conds node use?",
        "answer": "The Set Unmasked Conds node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what category does the Set Unmasked Conds node fall in ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved?",
        "answer": "The Set Unmasked Conds node falls under the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning' category in ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used by the Set Unmasked Conds node to process the inputs?",
        "answer": "The Set Unmasked Conds node uses the 'append_and_combine' function to process the inputs and combine the conditioning pairs."
