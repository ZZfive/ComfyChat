        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Threshold node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Threshold node is designed to process images by applying a threshold, which is particularly useful for creating binary images from grayscale inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the image parameter in the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The image parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the input that will undergo threshold processing, which is vital for the clarity and detail of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the threshold parameter influence the output of the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The threshold parameter is important as it determines the cutoff point for classifying pixel values in the image. It directly affects the node's output by controlling the conversion of grayscale values to either black or white, based on whether they meet or exceed the threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the thresholded_image output represent in the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The thresholded_image output represents the processed result of the input image after applying the threshold. It provides a binary version of the input, typically used for further analysis or as part of more complex image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Image_Threshold node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the threshold value calculated in the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "In the WAS_Image_Threshold node, the threshold value is calculated by multiplying the threshold parameter by 255, converting it to an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the threshold parameter in the WAS_Image_Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the threshold parameter in the WAS_Image_Threshold node is 0.5."
