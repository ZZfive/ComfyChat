        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageScaleDownBy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageScaleDownBy node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the size of an image by scaling down its dimensions while maintaining the integrity of the visual content and reducing the file size for more efficient processing or storage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the imageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the imageScaleDownBy node are 'images' and 'scale_by'. 'Images' represents the input images that the node will process, and 'scale_by' is a float value that defines the scaling factor for the image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale_by' parameter in imageScaleDownBy node define?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_by' parameter in the imageScaleDownBy node defines the scaling factor for the image dimensions. It directly affects the final size and aspect ratio of the resized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the imageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the imageScaleDownBy node is 'images', which includes the resized images that are now smaller in size but retain the important visual elements of the original images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the imageScaleDownBy node use?",
        "answer": "The imageScaleDownBy node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the imageScaleDownBy node calculate the new width and height of the image?",
        "answer": "The imageScaleDownBy node calculates the new width and height of the image by multiplying the original width and height by the 'scale_by' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'scale_by' parameter in the imageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'scale_by' parameter in the imageScaleDownBy node is 0.5."
