        "question": "What is the purpose of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node is used to configure the Canny edge detection process settings in the pipeline, allowing users to specify parameters such as edge detection intensity, start and end thresholds, and high and low thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node are: cannyedge_from, cannyedge_strength, cannyedge_start, cannyedge_end, cannyedge_low, and cannyedge_high."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cannyedge_from' parameter specify in the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'cannyedge_from' parameter specifies the image source for the Canny edge detection, allowing selection from predefined sources such as 'Source Image', 'Support Image', or 'Support Direct'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'cannyedge_strength' parameter in the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'cannyedge_strength' parameter determines the intensity of the edge detection process, with a range that allows fine-tuning the sensitivity of edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cannyedge_low' parameter specify in the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'cannyedge_low' parameter specifies the low threshold for the hysteresis process in Canny edge detection, affecting the detection of weaker edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node is 'cannyedge_settings', which outputs the configured Canny edge detection settings as a tuple that can be directly used in the detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node use?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet CannyEdge Settings node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
