        "question": "What is the purpose of the GlobalSeed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSeed node is designed to manage and control the generation process by using seed values, allowing users to determine the randomness of the output and ensure consistency or diversity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the GlobalSeed node are 'value' (an integer for setting the seed) and 'mode' (a string that determines how the seed value affects the generation process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' parameter in the GlobalSeed node control?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter is crucial for setting the seed of the generation process. By changing the seed, users can control the variation of the output, resulting in reproducible or diverse results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the GlobalSeed node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines how the seed value influences the generation process. It offers various modes such as 'fixed', 'increment', and 'randomize', each affecting the output differently and providing flexibility to the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'action' parameter in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'action' parameter provides a set of options that further refine the seed's impact on the generation. It works in conjunction with the 'mode' parameter, allowing fine-grained control over the randomness and consistency of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'last_seed' parameter in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'last_seed' parameter is used to inherit a seed from a previous generation, ensuring continuity between different runs of the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GlobalSeed node is a dictionary (Dict[str, Any]) that provides the results of the generation process, containing the randomness controlled by the input parameters."
