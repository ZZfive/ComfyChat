        "question": "What is the purpose of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CfgScheduleHookProvider node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and provide configuration schedules for the iterative process. It abstracts the complexity of handling different scheduling strategies by providing a simple interface to retrieve hooks based on specified iterations and target configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'schedule_for_iteration' parameter in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_for_iteration' parameter in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node is crucial because it determines which schedule will be used for the iterative process. It decides how the configuration is adjusted over time, affecting the final outcome of the entire process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'target_cfg' parameter in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node set?",
        "answer": "The 'target_cfg' parameter in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node sets the desired configuration value that the process aims to achieve. It is important because it directly influences the final configuration applied during the iterative process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node is a configured hook object that can be used to manage the schedule during the iterative process. It encapsulates the logic needed to adjust the configuration over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the CfgScheduleHookProvider node in ComfyUI is ImpactPack/Upscale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'hook' output in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'hook' output in the CfgScheduleHookProvider node is PK_HOOK, which corresponds to the Python datatype PixelKSampleHook."
