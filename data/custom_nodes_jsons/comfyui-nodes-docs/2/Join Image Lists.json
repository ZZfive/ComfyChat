        "question": "What is the purpose of the Join Image Lists node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Join Image Lists node is designed to merge multiple image lists into a single list while providing the sizes of the original lists. This functionality is crucial for operations that require the integration of image data from different sources, ensuring seamless integration and manipulation of image collections."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Join Image Lists node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Join Image Lists node are In1 and In2, both of which represent the image lists to be merged. In1 is the first image list and plays a key role in initiating the merging process, while In2 is the second image list that participates in the merging process along with the first list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does the Join Image Lists node accept?",
        "answer": "The Join Image Lists node accepts up to three optional image lists: In3, In4, and In5. These optional inputs provide flexibility for handling different numbers of image lists in the merging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Join Image Lists node produce?",
        "answer": "The Join Image Lists node produces two output types: Joined and Sizes. Joined is the merged image list from all input lists, while Sizes is a list of integers representing the sizes of the original input lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Join Image Lists node use?",
        "answer": "The Join Image Lists node uses the infra type 'CPU' for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Join Image Lists node merge the input image lists?",
        "answer": "The Join Image Lists node merges the input image lists by extending the joined list with images from each input list. It iterates through the required and optional input lists, appending the images to the joined list and recording the size of each original list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used by the Join Image Lists node to perform the merging operation?",
        "answer": "The function name used by the Join Image Lists node to perform the merging operation is 'join_lists'."
