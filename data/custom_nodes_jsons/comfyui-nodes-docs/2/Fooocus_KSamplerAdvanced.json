        "question": "What is the purpose of the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node enhances the sampling process in art generation by introducing a sharpening parameter, allowing for more precise control over the texture and details of the generated artwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'model' input parameter in the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input parameter specifies the model used for the sampling process, serving as the core component for generating artwork in the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'add_noise' input parameter affect the sampling process in the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' input parameter determines whether to add noise during the sampling process, influencing the texture and details of the generated artwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sharpness' parameter in the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node control?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpness' parameter allows users to adjust the level of detail and texture in the generated artwork, providing a way to fine-tune the visual output for more precise artistic control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node is 'latent', which represents the sampled artwork's output latent representation, reflecting the combined effect of all input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node integrate sharpening into the sampling workflow?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node integrates sharpening into the sampling workflow by directly incorporating the sharpening adjustment into the advanced sampling functionality, optimizing the visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node use?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
