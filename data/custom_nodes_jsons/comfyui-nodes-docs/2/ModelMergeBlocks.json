        "question": "What is the purpose of the ModelMergeBlocks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ModelMergeBlocks node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two different models into a single unified structure. It does this by cloning the first model and then applying key patches from the second model according to specified ratios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model1' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node?",
        "answer": "The 'model1' parameter represents the first model that will be cloned to serve as the base for the merging process in the ModelMergeBlocks node. It is crucial as it determines the initial structure of the resulting hybrid model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'model2' parameter play in the ModelMergeBlocks node?",
        "answer": "The 'model2' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node represents the second model from which key patches will be extracted and applied to the cloned model. These patches are essential for integrating the features of the second model into the merged model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'input' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node is a float value that serves as the default ratio for the merging process. It influences the impact of the patches from the second model on the final model and can be adjusted to fine-tune the merging result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'middle' parameter be used in the ModelMergeBlocks node?",
        "answer": "The 'middle' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node is a float value that can be used to specify a different ratio for certain patches during the merging process. It provides additional control over how the models are merged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'out' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node?",
        "answer": "The 'out' parameter in the ModelMergeBlocks node is a float value that defines the output ratio for the merging process. It is used to balance the contribution of the original models to the final hybrid model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'merged_model' represent in the ModelMergeBlocks node?",
        "answer": "The output 'merged_model' in the ModelMergeBlocks node represents the result of the merging process, combining the features from the input models into a single, cohesive structure. It embodies the culmination of the node's functionality, offering a new model with an enhanced capability set."
