        "question": "What is the purpose of the Boolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Boolean node in ComfyUI encapsulates the logic for processing Boolean values, making basic operations and conversions possible for logical data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "The required input for the Boolean node is the 'value' parameter, which is crucial as it determines the input for the Boolean operation. It serves as the basis for applying node logic and directly affects the result of the node execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the 'value' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the 'value' input parameter is BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'value' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'value' input parameter is bool."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Boolean node is 'boolean', which represents the result of the Boolean operation performed by the node. This is a key data fragment that can be used for further logical decision-making or as a condition in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Boolean node use?",
        "answer": "The Boolean node uses the CPU as its infra type."

        "question": "What is the category of the Boolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Boolean node in ComfyUI is 'EasyUse/Logic/Type'."
