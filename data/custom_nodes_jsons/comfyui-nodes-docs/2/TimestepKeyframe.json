        "question": "What is the purpose of the TimestepKeyframeNode class?",
        "answer": "The TimestepKeyframeNode class is a key component in generating advanced control networks, specifically designed to create and manipulate keyframes. It helps in defining the animation and simulation time structure, ensuring smooth and coherent transitions between states."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the starting_percentage parameter in TimestepKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The starting_percentage parameter defines the initial position of the keyframe on the timeline. This determines the sequence in which events occur in the animation and greatly influences how keyframes interact with other elements, guiding the overall workflow of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the strength parameter affect the TimestepKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The strength parameter adjusts the impact of the keyframe on the overall animation. It allows fine-tuning of the keyframe's effect, ensuring it contributes to the animation in a way that aligns with creative visions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the cn_weights parameter in the TimestepKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The cn_weights parameter specifies the weights to apply to the control net. This is crucial for forming the animation's response behavior to the keyframes, ensuring the desired effects and outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the latent_keyframe parameter used for?",
        "answer": "The latent_keyframe parameter provides a way to include latent keyframes in the animation, adding depth and complexity to the event sequence. It is an essential tool for creating intricate and detailed animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TimestepKeyframeNode return?",
        "answer": "The output of TimestepKeyframeNode is a TimestepKeyframe, which represents an animation time point with specific attributes such as starting percentage and strength. This output is foundational for further processing and rendering of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for TimestepKeyframeNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for TimestepKeyframeNode is CPU."
