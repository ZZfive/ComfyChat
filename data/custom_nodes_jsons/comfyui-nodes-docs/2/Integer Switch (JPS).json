        "question": "What is the purpose of the Integer Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Integer Switch (JPS) node is an efficient conditional selection tool that selects one integer input from multiple options based on specific criteria and outputs it. This node allows for dynamic selection of integer values and implements conditional logic in data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'select' parameter in the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter determines which integer input is selected and output. The selection process is based on this integer value, thus enabling conditional logic and dynamic data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are 'int_i' parameters in the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'int_i' parameters represent a series of optional integer inputs (from int_1 to int_5) in the Integer Switch (JPS) node. Each 'int_i' is a potential output that can be selected based on the 'select' criteria. These inputs provide flexibility to the node, allowing it to handle various possible scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Integer Switch (JPS) node is an integer value (int_out) selected according to the input criteria. It represents the final result of the node's processing and can be used by subsequent nodes or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Integer Switch (JPS) node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names of the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Integer Switch (JPS) node returns an integer value, with the return type being ('INT',) and the return name being ('int_out',)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do optional 'int_i' inputs work in the Integer Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the Integer Switch (JPS) node, the optional 'int_i' inputs are specified in the INPUT_TYPES class method. They are defined as optional inputs with the data type ('INT', {}). The 'int_i' inputs represent a series of optional integer inputs (from int_1 to int_5) that can be selected based on the 'select' criteria. The node allows for handling various possible scenarios by providing flexibility through these optional inputs."
