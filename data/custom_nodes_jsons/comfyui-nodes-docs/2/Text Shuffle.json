        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Shuffle node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Shuffle node in ComfyUI is designed to rearrange the order of elements within a given text string. It splits the text into a list of elements using a specified separator, randomly shuffles the list, and then recombines the elements into a new string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node represents the input text that will be shuffled. It is a crucial part of the node's operation as the entire process revolves around rearranging the elements of this text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'separator' parameter play in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'separator' parameter in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node defines the delimiter used to split the input text into individual elements before shuffling. It is essential for determining how the text is divided and how the elements are rearranged. The default value is a comma, but it can be adjusted based on specific requirements of the text being processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'seed' parameter important in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node is an optional integer used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the shuffling order is reproducible. This is particularly important in scenarios where consistent results are desired across multiple executions of the node. By providing a seed, users can control the randomness and obtain the same shuffling order every time the node is run with the same input and seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'shuffled_text' represent in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'shuffled_text' in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node represents the text obtained after the shuffling process. It is a direct reflection of the input text after its elements have been randomly rearranged. This output is important as it is the main result of the node's operation and serves as the basis for any subsequent processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Text_Shuffle node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'shuffle' method in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'shuffle' method in the WAS_Text_Shuffle node is responsible for the actual process of shuffling. It takes the input text, splits it into a list using the specified separator, shuffles the list randomly, and then joins the elements back into a new string using the same separator."
