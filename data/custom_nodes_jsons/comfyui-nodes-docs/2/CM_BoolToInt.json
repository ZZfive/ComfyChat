        "question": "What is the purpose of the BoolToInt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the BoolToInt node is to convert a boolean value to its integer equivalent, which is useful in scenarios where a numerical representation of boolean states is required, such as in mathematical operations or data processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected input type for the 'a' parameter in the BoolToInt node?",
        "answer": "The expected input type for the 'a' parameter in the BoolToInt node is a boolean value, which is essential for the conversion process as the node aims to convert this boolean value to an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the input 'a' parameter in the BoolToInt node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input 'a' parameter is BOOL, and the Python dtype is bool."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' output represent in the BoolToInt node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' output in the BoolToInt node represents the integer conversion of the input boolean value, which is important as it embodies the direct result of the node operation, summarizing the essence of the boolean to integer conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the output 'op' in the BoolToInt node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output 'op' is INT, and the Python dtype is int."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the BoolToInt node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the BoolToInt node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'op' method in the BoolToInt class?",
        "answer": "The 'op' method in the BoolToInt class takes a boolean value 'a' as input and returns a tuple containing the integer representation of that boolean value, where 'True' is mapped to 1 and 'False' is mapped to 0."
