        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Cross Fade Images node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Cross Fade Images node in ComfyUI is used to create a series of smoothly transitioning images, achieving a cross-fade effect from one set of images to another."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input required by the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The main input required by the IG Cross Fade Images node is a list of image tensors that need to be cross-faded. This is the primary input for generating the transition effect between images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'interpolation' parameter affect the transition in the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' parameter in the IG Cross Fade Images node determines the easing function used to calculate the alpha value for the cross-fade effect, influencing the dynamic effect of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'transitioning_frames' parameter control in the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The 'transitioning_frames' parameter in the IG Cross Fade Images node specifies the number of frames used for the transition between each pair of images, affecting the smoothness of the cross-fade effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'repeat_count' parameter affect the animation in the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeat_count' parameter in the IG Cross Fade Images node controls the number of times the current image is repeated before transitioning, allowing for customization of the animation's rhythm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The output of the IG Cross Fade Images node is a tensor containing the sequence of cross-faded images, representing a smooth transition between the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code of the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the IG Cross Fade Images node is written in Python."
