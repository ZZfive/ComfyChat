        "question": "What is the primary function of the WAS_Bus node in the WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bus node serves as the central hub for managing and coordinating various components in the WAS Suite, ensuring efficient transfer of models, clips, and other utilities between different parts of the system to facilitate seamless workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the WAS_Bus node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the WAS_Bus node include 'bus', 'model', 'clip', 'vae', 'positive', and 'negative'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bus' parameter hold in the WAS_Bus node?",
        "answer": "The 'bus' parameter in the WAS_Bus node holds optional elements such as models, clips, vae, forward, and negative, allowing related components to be bundled together, improving the efficiency of data transfer within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model' parameter in the WAS_Bus node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial for the function of the WAS_Bus node as it represents the core machine learning component used to process and analyze data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the WAS_Bus node return?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bus node returns output types 'bus', 'model', 'clip', 'vae', 'positive', and 'negative', encapsulating the processed components for structured access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'clip' output type in the WAS_Bus node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' output type represents multimedia data that has been processed or enhanced by the WAS_Bus node, crucial for applications requiring audio or video manipulation and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Bus node handle conditional processing?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bus node handles conditional processing through the 'positive' and 'negative' parameters, guiding the node's operations towards desired outcomes ('positive') and filtering out unwanted elements ('negative')."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the WAS_Bus node operate?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bus node operates on the CPU infrastructure type."
