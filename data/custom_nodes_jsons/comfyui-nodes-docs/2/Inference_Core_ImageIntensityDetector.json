        "question": "What is the primary function of the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node is a specialized tool for image preprocessing, primarily enhancing images by adjusting their brightness levels using gamma correction techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main object that undergoes brightness adjustment through gamma correction in the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The input image, specified by the 'image' parameter, is the main object that undergoes brightness adjustment through gamma correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'gamma_correction' parameter play in the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'gamma_correction' parameter specifies the gamma correction factor used to adjust the brightness level of the image, directly affecting the brightness and contrast of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter influence the image processing in the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter determines the resolution of the output image, deciding the dimensions to which the image will be adjusted during processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node is an image that has been adjusted for brightness based on the specified gamma correction, suitable for further analysis or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageIntensityDetector node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category in ComfyUI."
