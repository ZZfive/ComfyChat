        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateVoronoiMask custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateVoronoiMask custom node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a Voronoi mask, which is a type of geometric pattern that can be used for various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'num_points' parameter affect the Voronoi mask generated by the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_points' parameter specifies the number of points used to create the Voronoi diagram. It directly affects the complexity and detail of the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'speed' parameter control in the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'speed' parameter determines the rate at which points transition from their starting positions to their ending positions. It influences the dynamic movement in the mask sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'frame_width' and 'frame_height' parameters in the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_width' and 'frame_height' parameters set the width and height of each frame in the mask sequence. They are crucial for defining the aspect ratio and overall dimensions of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_inverted' output parameter represent in the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_inverted' output parameter provides an inverted version of the generated Voronoi mask. It is useful for creating complementary patterns or effects in image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CreateVoronoiMask node utilize the aspect ratio in generating the Voronoi mask?",
        "answer": "The CreateVoronoiMask node uses the aspect ratio, calculated as frame_width / frame_height, to scale the points in the Voronoi diagram. This ensures that the generated mask matches the desired dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The CreateVoronoiMask node is recommended to be run on a CPU infrastructure."
