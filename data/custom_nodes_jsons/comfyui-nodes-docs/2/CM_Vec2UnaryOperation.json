        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec2UnaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec2UnaryOperation node is designed to perform various unary operations on a 2D vector in ComfyUI. It takes an operation as input, which is a string representing a mathematical function, and applies that function to vector 'a', resulting in a transformed vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter specify in the Vec2UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter specifies the unary operation to be applied to the vector 'a'. It is a string corresponding to a predefined mathematical function. This parameter is crucial as it determines the nature of the transformation that the input vector will undergo."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the Vec2UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter is the 2D vector on which the unary operation will be applied. It is a key input because the entire operation revolves around transforming this vector according to the specified mathematical function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Vec2UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Vec2UnaryOperation node is the transformed vector after applying the unary operation specified by 'op' on the input vector 'a'. It represents the result of the mathematical transformation and is the primary output of the Vec2UnaryOperation node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ' Infra type' of the Vec2UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' of the Vec2UnaryOperation node is CPU, indicating that it is designed to run on a computer's central processing unit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code of the Vec2UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Vec2UnaryOperation node is written in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what does the 'FUNCTION' attribute represent in the Vec2UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'FUNCTION' attribute in the Vec2UnaryOperation class represents the operation to be performed, which is 'op' in this case. It indicates that the operation to be applied to the vector is determined by the 'op' parameter."
