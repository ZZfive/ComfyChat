        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class in ComfyUI is responsible for generating animated prompts based on given text and a series of parameters. It creates a sequence of prompts that can be used to drive an animation sequence, taking into account various weights and conditions to ensure smooth transitions between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class are: text, max_frames, print_output, current_frame, and clip."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' parameter represent in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class represents the raw text that will be used to generate the animated prompts. It is a crucial input as it directly affects the content and flow of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'max_frames' parameter in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' parameter in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class defines the maximum number of frames for the animation sequence. It is essential as it determines the total length of the animation and influences the distribution of prompts across the frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_output' parameter control in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The 'print_output' parameter in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class controls whether intermediate results of the animation process should be printed. It is helpful for debugging purposes or to provide feedback when creating animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be used to fine-tune the animation in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters that can be used to fine-tune the animation in the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class are: pre_text, app_text, pw_a, pw_b, pw_c, and pw_d. These parameters allow for adjustments to the initial and final states of the animation, as well as the weights of certain prompts within the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd class are POS and NEG. POS provides the positive conditioning data for the animation, representing the desired direction or outcome for each frame. NEG provides the negative conditioning data, defining what the animation should avoid or move away from at each frame."
