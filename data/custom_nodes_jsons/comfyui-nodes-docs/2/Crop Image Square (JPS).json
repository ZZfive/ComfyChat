        "question": "What is the purpose of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image Square (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to crop an image into a square shape based on specified parameters such as crop position, offsets, zoom level, interpolation method, target resolution, and sharpening strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Crop Image Square (JPS) node include: image, crop_position, offset_x, offset_y, zoom, interpolation, target_rez, and sharpening."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'zoom' parameter control in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'zoom' parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node determines the zoom level applied to the image before cropping, allowing for a more focused view on specific areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the final cropped image's resolution determined in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The final cropped image's resolution in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node is determined by the 'target_rez' parameter, which specifies the desired output square image size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sharpening' parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpening' parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node is used to apply sharpening strength to the cropped image, enhancing the details and edges of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node is IMAGE, which represents the resulting image after the cropping process, adjusted to the specified square shape, resolution, and quality enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used to implement the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image Square (JPS) node is implemented using the Python programming language."
