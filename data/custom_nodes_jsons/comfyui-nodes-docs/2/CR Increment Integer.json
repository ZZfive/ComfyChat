        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_IncrementInteger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_IncrementInteger node is designed to increment an integer value starting from a given frame over a specified frame duration. It is particularly useful for creating animations where a value needs to increase gradually over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the start_value parameter define in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The start_value parameter defines the initial integer value from which the incrementing begins. It is crucial for setting the starting point of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the step parameter affect the animation in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The step parameter specifies the amount by which the start_value is incremented per frame. It determines the rate at which the integer value changes throughout the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the start_frame parameter in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The start_frame parameter indicates the frame number at which the incrementing begins. It is essential for timing the start of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frame_duration parameter set in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The frame_duration parameter sets the number of frames over which the incrementing occurs. It determines the length of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the current_frame parameter used in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter represents the current frame number in the animation. It is used to calculate the current value of the integer based on the progress of the frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the show_help output provide in the CR_IncrementInteger node?",
        "answer": "The show_help output provides a string containing a URL that links to the documentation of the node, offering additional information and guidance on its usage."
