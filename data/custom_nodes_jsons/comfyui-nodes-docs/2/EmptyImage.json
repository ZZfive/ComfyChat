        "question": "What is the purpose of the EmptyImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EmptyImage node in ComfyUI is designed to generate blank images with specified dimensions and colors. It serves as a foundational component for image processing workflows, providing a blank canvas for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the EmptyImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the EmptyImage node are 'width' and 'height', which determine the dimensions of the generated image in pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter in the EmptyImage node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter in the EmptyImage node indicates the number of images generated in a single operation. It is particularly useful for processing multiple images simultaneously, improving efficiency in batch processing scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the color of the generated image specified in the EmptyImage node?",
        "answer": "The color of the generated image in the EmptyImage node is specified using the 'color' parameter, which accepts an integer representing the color in RGB format, allowing for the creation of images with the desired uniform background color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the EmptyImage node?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the EmptyImage node is the 'image' output, which represents the generated blank image with defined dimensions and color. This output is crucial as it lays the foundation for further image operations and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the EmptyImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the EmptyImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for implementing the EmptyImage node?",
        "answer": "The EmptyImage node is implemented using Python, as evident from the provided source code."
