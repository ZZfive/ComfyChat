    {
        "question": "What task does LLMImageTextReader node perform?",
        "answer": "LLMImageTextReader node reads and processes images, extracting text and additional information based on user-defined parameters. It utilizes underlying image processing and text extraction techniques to promote analysis and interpretation of image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the \"path\" parameter defined in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "\"path\" is a required parameter that specifies the path to the image file to be processed. This parameter is critical as it determines the source image used for text extraction and further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported data types for the \"path\" parameter?",
        "answer": "The \"path\" parameter supports the \"COMPY.dtype.STRING\" and \"PYTHON.dtype.str\" data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"parse_text\" parameter in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The \"parse_text\" parameter is an optional boolean flag indicating whether text should be extracted from the image. This parameter affects whether the node performs text parsing operations on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the \"parse_text\" parameter?",
        "answer": "The default value for the \"parse_text\" parameter is \"False\", meaning text extraction by default is not performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"extra_info\" parameter in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The \"extra_info\" parameter is an optional parameter that contains additional information in JSON format. This information can be used to provide context or instructions for processing the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the \"extra_info\" parameter?",
        "answer": "The default value for the \"extra_info\" parameter is '{}', an empty JSON object indicating no additional information is provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the name of the main class used by LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The main class used by LLMImageTextReader is \"llama_index.readers.file.image.base.ImageReader\"."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"keep_image\" parameter in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The \"keep_image\" parameter is an optional boolean flag that determines whether the processed image should be kept. By default, it is set to \"False\", meaning the processed image is not saved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The category of LLMImageTextReader is \"SALT/Language Toolkit/Readers\"."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the frequency of drawing the LLMImageTextReader node?",
        "answer": "The document does not specify the frequency of drawing the LLMImageTextReader node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the execute method in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The execute method in LLMImageTextReader returns a tuple containing a single element, which is a tuple of documents. These documents contain the image processing and text extraction results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the necessary condition for the execute method in LLMImageTextReader to return a valid result?",
        "answer": "For the execute method in LLMImageTextReader to return a valid result, the specified image file path must exist, and the parse_text parameter must be set to either True or False."
