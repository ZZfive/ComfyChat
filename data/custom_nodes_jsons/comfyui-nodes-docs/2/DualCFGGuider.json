        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the DualCFGGuider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the DualCFGGuider node is to guide the sampling process of the generative model using two sets of conditions, allowing for fine-tuned control over the output by adjusting the influence of positive, negative, and intermediate conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the model parameter crucial for the DualCFGGuider node?",
        "answer": "The model parameter is crucial because it represents the generative model that the node will use for the sampling process. It defines the foundation upon which conditions and configurations are applied to generate the desired output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cond1 input contribute to the sampling process in the DualCFGGuider node?",
        "answer": "The cond1 input is essential for providing the initial context or guidance for the sampling process. It helps shape the direction of the generated content according to the specific requirements of the task at hand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the negative input play in the DualCFGGuider node?",
        "answer": "The negative input plays a key role in steering the sampling process away from undesired outcomes. It helps define what should be avoided in the generated content, ensuring that the results are more targeted and focused."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cfg_conds parameter influence the sampling process in the DualCFGGuider node?",
        "answer": "The cfg_conds parameter allows for adjusting the balance of positive and negative influences during the sampling process. It is an important parameter for achieving the desired level of control over the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the cfg_cond2_negative parameter in the DualCFGGuider node?",
        "answer": "The cfg_cond2_negative parameter is used to fine-tune the influence of the second condition input, particularly in its role as a negative condition. It provides a mechanism to adjust the strength of the negative guidance applied during sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the DualCFGGuider node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the DualCFGGuider node is a configured instance of the DualCFGGuider class, ready to be used in the sampling process. It encapsulates the conditions and configurations set by the user, ensuring that the sampling adheres to the desired specifications."
