        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional prompt parameter in the SeargeImageSave node?",
        "answer": "The optional prompt parameter in the SeargeImageSave node, if provided, includes the prompt text in the image metadata, adding context to the image that may be useful for future reference."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeImageSave node handle the save_to parameter?",
        "answer": "The save_to parameter specifies the destination folder for saving the images. If it is set to a certain value, the output directory is set accordingly, and the filename_prefix is modified to include the date."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeImageSave node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeImageSave node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
