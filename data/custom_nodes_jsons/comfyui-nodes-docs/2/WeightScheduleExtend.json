        "question": "What is the purpose of the WeightScheduleExtend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WeightScheduleExtend node in ComfyUI is designed to extend and convert different types of value lists or series, supporting multiple input types and outputting the extended or converted values in a specified format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WeightScheduleExtend node are 'input_values_i', which is the main input of unknown format that needs to be extended or converted, and 'output_type', which specifies the desired output format for the extended or converted data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WeightScheduleExtend node is 'float', which can be a single floating-point value or a collection of floating-point values, depending on the operation performed and the specified output type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported output types in the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The WeightScheduleExtend node supports four output types: 'match_input', 'list', 'pandas series', and 'tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WeightScheduleExtend node handle input values with different formats?",
        "answer": "If the input values have different formats, the WeightScheduleExtend node converts 'input_values_2' to the same format as 'input_values_1' to ensure compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WeightScheduleExtend node do if the input types match?",
        "answer": "If the input types match, the WeightScheduleExtend node does not perform any conversion and simply uses 'input_values_2' as is."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when an unsupported output type is specified in the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "If an unsupported output type is specified in the WeightScheduleExtend node, a 'ValueError' is raised, indicating that the output type is not supported."
