        "question": "What is the required input for the WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node requires two inputs: the 'image' parameter, which is the main image into which the face image will be pasted, and the 'crop_image' parameter, which is the face image that will be pasted onto the main image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs are available for the WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node has three optional inputs: 'crop_data', which defines the cropping area for the face image, 'crop_blending', which controls the blending factor when pasting the face image, and 'crop_sharpening', which determines the level of sharpening applied to the face image before pasting."

    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node produce?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node produces two outputs: 'IMAGE', which represents the final image with the face image pasted onto the main image, and 'MASK_IMAGE', which is a mask image indicating the areas of transparency and influence of the blending process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node handle invalid crop data?",
        "answer": "If no valid crop data is found, the WAS_Image_Paste_Face_Crop node will print an error message and return the original main image along with a blank mask image of the same size."
