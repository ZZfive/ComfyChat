        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_To_Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_To_Seed node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a series of images into a corresponding set of seeds. It generates a unique identifier for each image based on its inherent properties, which can be used for various applications such as image indexing or retrieval systems."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'images' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter is crucial for the operation of the WAS_Image_To_Seed node as it serves as the input data that the node processes. Each image is converted into a seed through a series of operations. The quality and characteristics of the input images directly influence the generated seeds and their subsequent applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seeds' output represent in the WAS_Image_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'seeds' output in the WAS_Image_To_Seed node represents a list of integers, where each integer is a seed derived from the input images. Each seed is a hash-based summary of the image's content, providing a concise and unique representation. This output is important as it lays the foundation for further processing or analysis in downstream tasks."

    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Image_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Image_To_Seed node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Image_To_Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_To_Seed node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Analyze' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the WAS_Image_To_Seed node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the WAS_Image_To_Seed node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input and output data types of the WAS_Image_To_Seed node in terms of Comfy and Python data types?",
        "answer": "The input data type for the 'images' parameter is 'IMAGE' in Comfy and List[torch.Tensor] in Python. The output data type for the 'seeds' is 'INT' in Comfy and List[int] in Python."
