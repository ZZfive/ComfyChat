        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceEmbedDistance node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceEmbedDistance node is designed to analyze and compare facial features using Euclidean and cosine distance metrics. It processes input images and reference images to determine similarity, facilitating the recognition and verification of faces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FaceEmbedDistance node are analysis_models, reference, and image. analysis_models contains the necessary models for face detection and embedding extraction. reference is the reference image that is crucial for comparison with the input images. image refers to the images that will be analyzed and compared with the reference images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional input 'generate_image_overlay' do in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "When the 'generate_image_overlay' option is enabled, it generates an overlay on the input images displaying the distance metrics, providing a visual representation of the face analysis results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the FaceEmbedDistance node are IMAGE, euclidean, cosine, and csv. IMAGE represents the output images that have been analyzed. euclidean provides the Euclidean distance value quantifying the difference between the reference and input images. cosine provides the cosine distance value measuring the directional difference between facial embeddings. csv contains structured records of the face analysis including distance metrics."

    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'filter_thresh_eucl' parameter in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'filter_thresh_eucl' parameter in the FaceEmbedDistance node is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'filter_thresh_cos' parameter in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'filter_thresh_cos' parameter in the FaceEmbedDistance node is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the FaceEmbedDistance node is CPU."
