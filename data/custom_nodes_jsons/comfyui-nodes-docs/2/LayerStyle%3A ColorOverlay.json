        "question": "What does the class ColorMap provide?",
        "answer": "The ColorOverlay class provides a color overlay function for layer images. It allows for applying a color overlay on a background image using a specified blend mode, opacity, and color, either in addition to or replacing certain settings in the old KSampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ColorOverlay class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ColorOverlay class are background_image (an image to be used as the background), layer_image (an image to be synthesized with the background image), invert_mask (a boolean mask indicating whether to invert the colors), blend_mode (a string indicating the blending mode), opacity (an integer representing the transparency level), and color (a string representing the color overlay color). Optionally, layer_mask can also be provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the invert_mask parameter in the ColorOverlay class?",
        "answer": "The invert_mask parameter in the ColorOverlay class is used to invert the colors of the layer image if it's set to True. This can be useful in situations where one wishes to see the reversed effect of the color overlay."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I use the ColorOverlay class?",
        "answer": "To use the ColorOverlay class, one first needs to create an instance of it. Then, one can call the color_overlay method with the required and optional parameters (background_image, layer_image, invert_mask, blend_mode, opacity, color, layer_mask). The layer_image is synthesized on the background_image with the given parameters. The output is an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output provided by the ColorOverlay class?",
        "answer": "The ColorOverlay class provides one output: image (the synthesized output image from layer and background images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ColorOverlay class?",
        "answer": "The ColorOverlay class belongs to the category ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerStyle."
