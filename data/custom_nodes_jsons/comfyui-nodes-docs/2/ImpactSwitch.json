        "question": "What is the purpose of the GeneralSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GeneralSwitch node is designed to manage the flow of data in workflows by selecting the input specified by a given index. It operates by evaluating the provided index and determining the corresponding input to process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'select' parameter in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter is crucial as it determines which input will be processed by the node. It serves as the decision factor that allows the node to identify and select the appropriate input from the available options."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sel_mode' parameter affect the operation of the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'sel_mode' parameter determines whether the selection is based on prompt or execution context. It provides flexibility in how the node interprets and reacts to the selection criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'selected_value' output represent in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_value' output represents the data that the node has chosen based on the provided index. This is a key output as it determines how data flows to subsequent nodes in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'selected_label' output provide in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_label' output provides the label associated with the selected input. It is useful for debugging and providing context to the decision-making process of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'selected_index' output used in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_index' output indicates the index that was used to select the input. It serves as a record of the decision made by the node, which may be important for auditing and tracking purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'unique_id' parameter in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is a hidden field that helps identify the specific node in the workflow. It is important for internal tracking and ensures that the node's operations are correctly associated with its position in the workflow."
