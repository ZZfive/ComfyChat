        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstantID Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe node is designed to handle the settings for instant identity recognition functionality. It encapsulates the logic for processing various parameters such as weight, strength, noise, start and end, and returns these processed settings for further use in identity recognition tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InstantID Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe node requires an input named 'instantid_settings' of type BASIC_PIPE, which is a tuple of floats defining the settings for instant identity recognition, including weight, strength, noise, start and end parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight' parameter in instantid_settings control?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter adjusts the emphasis on certain features during the recognition process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the instant identity recognition process?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter controls the robustness of the recognition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'noise' parameter in instantid_settings?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' parameter can simulate variability in the recognition scenario."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'start' and 'end' parameters define in the InstantID Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' and 'end' parameters define the operating range, ensuring precise control over the recognition stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the InstantID Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe node outputs five float values: 'ip_weight', 'cn_strength', 'noise', 'start', and 'end', which are the processed settings for instant identity recognition."
