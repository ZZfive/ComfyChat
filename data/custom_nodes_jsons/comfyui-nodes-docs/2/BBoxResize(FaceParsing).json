        "question": "What is the purpose of the BBoxResize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BBoxResize node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the size of a bounding box (BBOX) to fit new image dimensions. It performs a scaling operation that ensures the bounding box coordinates are resized proportionally while maintaining their relative position within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BBoxResize node are 'bbox', 'width_old', 'height_old', 'width', and 'height'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bbox' parameter represent in the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox' parameter represents the bounding box coordinates that need to be resized. It is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the initial position and size of the object in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'width_old' and 'height_old' parameters in the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'width_old' parameter specifies the original image width relative to the bounding box coordinates, and the 'height_old' parameter defines the original height of the image. Both are necessary for calculating the correct scaling factor for the new dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'width' and 'height' parameters indicate in the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter represents the new width of the image after resizing, and the 'height' parameter represents the new height of the image after resizing. Both are key inputs for the node to compute the adjusted bounding box coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BBoxResize node is 'BBOX', which represents the resized bounding box coordinates adjusted to fit the new image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the BBoxResize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the BBoxResize node is CPU."
