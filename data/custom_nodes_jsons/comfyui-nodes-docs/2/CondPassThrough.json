        "question": "What is the purpose of the CondPassThrough node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CondPassThrough node is designed to directly pass through positive and negative conditional data, serving as a workaround when the limitations of the Set node may hinder this operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CondPassThrough node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CondPassThrough node are 'positive' and 'negative', both of which are of Comfy dtype CONDITIONING and Python dtype tuple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive' input represent in the CondPassThrough node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input represents the positive conditional data to be passed through. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the data flow, especially in bypass scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'negative' input represent in the CondPassThrough node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' input represents the negative conditional data to be passed through. It ensures that negative conditional data can also be seamlessly integrated into the workflow without alteration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CondPassThrough node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CondPassThrough node are 'positive' and 'negative', both of which are of Comfy dtype CONDITIONING and Python dtype tuple. They output the unmodified positive and negative conditional data, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CondPassThrough node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CondPassThrough node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CondPassThrough node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the CondPassThrough node is KJNodes/misc."
