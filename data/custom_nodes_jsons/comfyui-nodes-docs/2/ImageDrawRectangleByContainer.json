        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node in ComfyUI is used to draw rectangles within a specified container, allowing precise control over the dimensions and style of the rectangle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node include container, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, outline_size, outline_red, outline_green, outline_blue, outline_alpha, fill_red, fill_green, fill_blue, fill_alpha, SSAA, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'container' input represent in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'container' input in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node represents the container used for drawing the rectangle, defining the boundaries and context of the drawing operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the start_x, start_y, end_x, and end_y inputs used in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The start_x, start_y, end_x, and end_y inputs in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node specify the starting and ending coordinates of the rectangle, marking the horizontal and vertical boundaries of the shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the outline_red, outline_green, outline_blue, and outline_alpha inputs control in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The outline_red, outline_green, outline_blue, and outline_alpha inputs in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node control the color and transparency of the rectangle's outline, contributing to the overall appearance of the shape's border."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the fill_red, fill_green, fill_blue, and fill_alpha inputs control in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The fill_red, fill_green, fill_blue, and fill_alpha inputs in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node control the color and transparency of the rectangle's fill, determining the primary color inside the shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SSAA input in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The SSAA input in the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node specifies the supersampling anti-aliasing factor, which improves image quality by reducing jagged edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageDrawRectangleByContainer node is an IMAGE, representing the resulting image with the drawn rectangle inside the specified container, reflecting all the specified styles and dimensions."
