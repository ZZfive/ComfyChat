        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageClamp node is designed to serve as a transition or checkpoint in the data processing pipeline, allowing unmodified image data to pass through. It ensures that the image data conforms to expected formats or standards without altering the content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageClamp node is 'image', which represents the image data that will pass through the node without modification. It serves as a mechanism to ensure that data in the pipeline conforms to expected formats or standards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageClamp node is IMAGE."

    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageClamp node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageClamp node is 'image', which is the unmodified image data ensuring that it conforms to expected formats or standards in the data processing pipeline."
