        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltThresholdSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltThresholdSchedule node in ComfyUI is used to apply fade-in and fade-out effects to a schedule list based on specific parameters such as fade type and intensity, creating smooth transitions or highlighting certain parts of the schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltThresholdSchedule node are: float_schedule (LIST), max_frames (INT), output_mode (COMBO[STRING]), and schedule_values (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the float_schedule parameter represent in the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The float_schedule parameter represents the list of schedule values to which the fade-in and fade-out effects will be applied. It serves as the foundation for determining the base values for the effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the SaltThresholdSchedule node formatted?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltThresholdSchedule node is formatted based on the output_mode parameter, which can be 'prompt_schedule', 'float_list', 'int_list', or 'raw'. This parameter determines how the modified schedule values are presented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the schedule_values parameter in the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The schedule_values parameter is a string that provides detailed information about specific schedule values and their corresponding descriptions or settings. It allows for customizing schedule values based on textual descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltThresholdSchedule node is a list of modified schedule values (value_schedule_list) that showcases the dynamic transitions between the values after applying the specified fade-in and fade-out effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltThresholdSchedule node is CPU."
