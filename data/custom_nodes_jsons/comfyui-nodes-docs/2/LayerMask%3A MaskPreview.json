        "question": "What is the required input type for the MaskPreview node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MaskPreview node is 'mask' which is of Comfy dtype 'MASK' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the MaskPreview node have any direct outputs?",
        "answer": "No, the MaskPreview node does not have any direct outputs. It indirectly outputs by saving preview images."
    },

    {
        "question": "What category does the MaskPreview node belong to?",
        "answer": "The MaskPreview node belongs to the category 'ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerMask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskPreview node generate preview images from masks?",
        "answer": "If the mask has 2 dimensions, the MaskPreview node first adds an additional dimension using torch.unsqueeze. Then it reshapes the mask, moves the second dimension to the end, and expands the last dimension to 3 to create the preview image."
