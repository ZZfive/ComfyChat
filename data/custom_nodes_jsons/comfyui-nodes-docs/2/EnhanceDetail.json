        "question": "What is the purpose of the EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI is designed to improve the visual quality of images by applying a series of filters that can enhance details, adjust sharpness, and potentially reduce noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required for the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required for the EnhanceDetail node is the input image that needs to be enhanced. This parameter is crucial as it directly affects the enhancement process and serves as the basis for all subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the filter_radius parameter affect the image enhancement process in the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The filter_radius parameter specifies the radius of the filter applied during the enhancement process. A larger radius may lead to more pronounced detail enhancement but may also increase processing time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sigma parameter control in the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The sigma parameter controls the sigma parameter of the guided filter, affecting the smoothness level and detail preservation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the denoise parameter influence the image enhancement in the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The denoise parameter determines the strength of the denoising filter. Higher values can reduce noise but may also weaken details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the detail_mult parameter in the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The detail_mult parameter is a multiplier for detail enhancement. Adjusting this value can fine-tune the intensity of the detail enhancement effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The output of the EnhanceDetail node is the enhanced image, which is expected to have better detail representation and potentially reduced noise."
