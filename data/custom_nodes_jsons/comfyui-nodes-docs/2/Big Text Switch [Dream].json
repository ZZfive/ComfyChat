        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Text Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Big Text Switch node is designed to dynamically select one text input from multiple options based on specified conditions, allowing conditional logic to be implemented in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'select' input in the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input specifies the index of the text input to be selected. It plays a crucial role in determining which text input is chosen based on the provided conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'on_missing' input define in the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_missing' input defines the behavior when the selected text input does not meet the specified conditions, allowing fallback mechanisms to switch to the previous or next valid input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_i' optional input represent in the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_i' optional input represents one of the ten available text inputs, where 'i' can range from 0 to 9. Each input can be individually set with default values, ensuring there is always a usable value even if no explicit value is provided. The index 'i' allows dynamic selection among multiple inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Big Text Switch node is 'selected', which represents the text value chosen based on the specified conditions and inputs. It is the result of the conditional logic applied by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the Big Text Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used to implement the Big Text Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Big Text Switch node is implemented using Python, as evident from the provided source code."
