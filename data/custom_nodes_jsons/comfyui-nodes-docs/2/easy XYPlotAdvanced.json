        "question": "What is the purpose of the pipeXYPlotAdvanced custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The pipeXYPlotAdvanced custom node in ComfyUI is designed to provide advanced XY plotting capabilities specifically tailored to meet the needs of pipeline routes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node are 'pipe' (Comfy dtype: PIPE_LINE, Python dtype: Dict), 'grid_spacing' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), 'output_individuals' (Comfy dtype: BOOL, Python dtype: bool), and 'flip_xy' (Comfy dtype: BOOL, Python dtype: bool)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'grid_spacing' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node control?",
        "answer": "The 'grid_spacing' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node determines the spacing between grid lines in the chart, affecting the overall clarity and readability of the visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'output_individuals' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_individuals' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node allows the user to control whether individual data points are displayed separately in the chart, which is important for analyzing specific data points and their relationships within the dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'flip_xy' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node allow the user to do?",
        "answer": "The 'flip_xy' parameter in the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node allows the user to flip the X-axis and Y-axis, which can be useful in certain data visualization scenarios, especially when the traditional orientation is not the optimal choice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node are 'X' (Comfy dtype: X_Y, Python dtype: Dict) and 'Y' (Comfy dtype: X_Y, Python dtype: Dict)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the pipeXYPlotAdvanced node is 'pipe' (Comfy dtype: PIPE_LINE, Python dtype: Dict), which is an updated version of the input 'pipe' that now includes the generated XY plot information."
