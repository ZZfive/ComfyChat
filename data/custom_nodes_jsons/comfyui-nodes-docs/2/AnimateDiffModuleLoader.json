        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffModuleLoader node is designed to manage and manipulate motion modules within an animation framework, focusing on integrating and applying advanced motion techniques to enhance the dynamism and fluidity of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model_name' input in the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' input is crucial for identifying the specific motion module to be loaded and manipulated. It determines the source of the animation assets and lays the foundation for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_stack' input in the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node allow for?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_stack' input, when provided, allows for fine-tuning of the motion module through layer-wise adjustments. It enhances the adaptability and customization of animations to meet specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node is a 'motion_module', which represents the finalized and optimized animation module ready for use in the animation pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when a 'lora_stack' is provided to the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node?",
        "answer": "When a 'lora_stack' is provided, the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node injects the LoRA into the motion module, allowing for fine-tuning of the animation. If the motion module is v2, it also handles the ejection of any previously injected LoRA stacks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'eject_loras' method in the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'eject_loras' method in the AnimateDiffModuleLoader node removes the injected LoRA adjustments from the motion module, reversing the effects of the 'inject_loras' method."
