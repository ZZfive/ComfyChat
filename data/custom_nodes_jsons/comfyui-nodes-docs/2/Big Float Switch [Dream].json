        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Float Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Big Float Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to select a floating-point value from a set of inputs based on specified conditions. It enhances flexibility and adaptability in numerical data processing by allowing value selection based on runtime conditions, facilitating dynamic decision-making in data flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'select' input in the Big Float Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input specifies the initial selection index for the input. The node will attempt to select this input, but it may choose another based on the 'on_missing' strategy and the presence of valid data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'on_missing' input affect the behavior of the Big Float Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_missing' input determines the node's behavior when the initially selected input does not meet the validation standard. It can move to the previous or next input until a valid input is found, ensuring a fallback mechanism is in place."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the optional 'input_i' inputs represent in the Big Float Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'input_i' inputs represent multiple floating-point inputs that can be selected by the node. Each 'input_i' represents a potential value that may be selected based on the selection criteria, where 'i' can range from 0 to n, indicating flexibility in the number of inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'selected' output in the Big Float Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected' output in the Big Float Switch node is a floating-point value that is selected by the node based on the specified conditions and inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Big Float Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The Big Float Switch node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code of the Big Float Switch node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Big Float Switch node is written in Python."
