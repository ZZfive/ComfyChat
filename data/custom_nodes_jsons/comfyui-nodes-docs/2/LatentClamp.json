        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentClamp node is designed to pass through the latent representation without any modifications, acting as a placeholder or checkpoint in the pipeline to ensure that the latent data structure is preserved for subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the LatentClamp node?",
        "answer": "The LatentClamp node requires a 'latent' input parameter, which represents the latent data structure that needs to be passed through."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the 'latent' input parameter in LatentClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the 'latent' input parameter in the LatentClamp node is LATENT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'latent' input parameter in LatentClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'latent' input parameter in the LatentClamp node is Dict[str, torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentClamp node?",
        "answer": "The LatentClamp node outputs the unmodified latent data structure to ensure continuity in processing pipelines where the integrity of the latent representation is crucial."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the RETURN_TYPES value specified in the LatentClamp class?",
        "answer": "The RETURN_TYPES value specified in the LatentClamp class is ('LATENT',)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the LatentClamp node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LatentClamp node is CPU."
