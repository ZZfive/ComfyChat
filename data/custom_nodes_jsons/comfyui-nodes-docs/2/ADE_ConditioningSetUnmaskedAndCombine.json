        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node is used for advanced conditioning data operations in the model, with a focus on unmasking and combining different sets of condition inputs. It enhances or modifies the generation process by applying complex condition transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node are 'cond' and 'cond_DEFAULT'. 'cond' serves as the main condition input that acts as the base for transformations, while 'cond_DEFAULT' is an additional condition input meant to be combined with the main condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node is 'opt_lora_hook', which allows for the application of a Lora hook to the condition inputs, providing further customization and control mechanisms for the conditioning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node is 'conditioning', which represents the modified or enhanced condition state to be used for the generation model, combining and unmasking the provided condition inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node use?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node is classified under the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/single cond ops' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node to combine condition inputs?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetUnmaskedAndCombine node uses the 'append_and_combine' function to combine condition inputs, which internally calls the 'set_unmasked_and_combine_conds' function with the provided 'cond', 'cond_DEFAULT', and optional 'opt_lora_hook' inputs."
