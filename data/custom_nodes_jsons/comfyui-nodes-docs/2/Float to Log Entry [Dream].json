        "question": "What is the purpose of the Float to Log Entry node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Float to Log Entry node is designed to convert a floating-point number into a log entry, facilitating the tracking and recording of numerical data within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Float to Log Entry node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Float to Log Entry node are 'value', which represents the float to be recorded, and 'label', an optional prefix to provide context or categorization for the recorded numerical data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype does the 'value' input accept?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input accepts the Comfy dtype FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'label' input?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'label' input is str (string)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Float to Log Entry node produce?",
        "answer": "The Float to Log Entry node outputs a structured log entry that encapsulates the provided float value, optionally prefixed with a label, presented in a format suitable for recording and tracking."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output 'log_entry'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output 'log_entry' is LOG_ENTRY."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type does the Float to Log Entry node run?",
        "answer": "The Float to Log Entry node runs on the 'CPU' infra type."
