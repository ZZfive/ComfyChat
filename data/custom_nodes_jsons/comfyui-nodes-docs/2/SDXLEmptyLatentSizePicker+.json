    {
        "question": "How does the noise generator work in CG Soonie?",
        "answer": "The noise generator in CG Soonie generates noise to add effect to the animation. By default, it adds noise to 0-255 RGBA, 0-127 grayscale, and HSV values."

        "question": "How should I use PG-neo to create a video?",
        "answer": "To use PG-neo to create a video, you need to place the PG-neo before the image exporting nodes. From then on, all the images will be stored in the json file and passed as video frames to ffmpeg."
