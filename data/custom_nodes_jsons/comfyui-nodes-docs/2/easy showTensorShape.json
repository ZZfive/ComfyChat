        "question": "What is the purpose of the showTensorShape node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The showTensorShape node in ComfyUI provides a high-level overview of the tensor shape, which helps in understanding data structures without involving specific method details. It is a key tool for debugging and ensuring correct tensor dimensions in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the showTensorShape node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the showTensorShape node is the 'tensor' parameter, which carries the data that the node will analyze. It can be a tensor, list, or dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'unique_id' parameter do in the showTensorShape node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter, although not required, serves as an identifier for the tensor shape information, allowing for easier tracking and management of data within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter enhance the functionality of the showTensorShape node?",
        "answer": "If provided, the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter adds extra context to the tensor shape information, potentially enhancing the node's usefulness in more complex data processing scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the showTensorShape node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the showTensorShape node is a dictionary containing a text representation of the tensor shape, which is crucial for visualizing data structures and ensuring correct information for subsequent steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the showTensorShape node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the showTensorShape node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the showTensorShape node handle different input types like dict, list, and tensor?",
        "answer": "The showTensorShape node uses a recursive function 'tensorShape' to handle different input types. It iterates through the input and appends the shape of tensors to a list called 'shapes', which is then returned as part of the output dictionary."
