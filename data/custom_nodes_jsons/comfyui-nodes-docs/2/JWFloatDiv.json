        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatDiv node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatDiv node in ComfyUI performs a division operation between two floating-point values and returns a floating-point result. This operation allows for dynamic calculation of ratios or making adjustments based on floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the JWFloatDiv node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the JWFloatDiv node represents the dividend in the division operation. It is a crucial component as it determines the starting base value for the division."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'b' parameter in the JWFloatDiv node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter in the JWFloatDiv node acts as the divisor in the division operation. Its value directly influences the result and is essential for calculating the division result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWFloatDiv node?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWFloatDiv node is the result of dividing the 'a' parameter by the 'b' parameter. It represents the quotient in floating-point format."
