        "question": "What is the class name of the node in the DragNUWA category that coordinates image data flow in loops?",
        "answer": "The class name is LoopEnd_IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is LoopEnd_IMAGE an output node?",
        "answer": "Yes, LoopEnd_IMAGE is an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LoopEnd_IMAGE node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LoopEnd_IMAGE node are 'send_to_next_loop' and 'loop'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'send_to_next_loop' input in the LoopEnd_IMAGE node?",
        "answer": "The 'send_to_next_loop' input is the image data that will be routed to the next stage of the loop, playing a key role in the continuity and progress of the image processing workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'loop' input in the LoopEnd_IMAGE node?",
        "answer": "The 'loop' input is the loop structure being operated on to control the flow of image data, essential for establishing the sequence of operations within the loop."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoopEnd_IMAGE node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoopEnd_IMAGE node is 'return', which indicates the completion of the node's function and successful routing of the image data to the next loop segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the LoopEnd_IMAGE node use?",
        "answer": "The LoopEnd_IMAGE node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
