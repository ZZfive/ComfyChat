        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SetValueOnBinary node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetValueOnBinary node is designed to conditionally assign a value based on the state of a binary input. If the binary input is true (1), it returns the value specified for the true case; if it is false (0), it returns the value for the false case."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_SetValueOnBinary node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_SetValueOnBinary node are 'binary', 'value_if_1', and 'value_if_0'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'binary' parameter do in the CR_SetValueOnBinary node?",
        "answer": "The 'binary' parameter is a critical input that determines the behavior of the node. It serves as the condition for deciding which value the node will return. The binary input must be an integer, either 0 or 1, ensuring a clear and explicit condition check."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'value_if_1' parameter in the CR_SetValueOnBinary node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_if_1' parameter defines the value that will be returned when the binary input is true. It is a float, allowing for a wide range of values and flexibility when conditionally assigning based on the binary condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value_if_0' parameter set in the CR_SetValueOnBinary node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_if_0' parameter sets the value that will be returned when the binary input is false. Like 'value_if_1', it is also a float, ensuring consistency in the type of values the node can return, regardless of the binary condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_SetValueOnBinary node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetValueOnBinary node provides three output types: 'INT', 'FLOAT', and 'show_help'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output in the CR_SetValueOnBinary node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation page, allowing users to easily access more detailed information on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_SetValueOnBinary node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetValueOnBinary node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
