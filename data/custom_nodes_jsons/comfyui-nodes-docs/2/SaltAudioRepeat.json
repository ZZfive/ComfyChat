        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioRepeat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioRepeat node is designed to repeat an audio segment a specified number of times, which is useful for extending the duration of an audio segment without altering its original content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SaltAudioRepeat node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SaltAudioRepeat node are 'audio', which is the original audio data to be processed, and 'repeat_times', which specifies the number of times the audio segment should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'audio' parameter in the SaltAudioRepeat node?",
        "answer": "In the SaltAudioRepeat node, the 'audio' parameter is of Comfy dtype 'AUDIO' and Python dtype 'bytes'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'repeat_times' parameter in the SaltAudioRepeat node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'repeat_times' parameter in the SaltAudioRepeat node specifies the number of times the audio segment should be repeated, directly affecting the length of the final audio output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioRepeat node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioRepeat node is the audio data after being repeated the specified number of times, effectively extending its duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the SaltAudioRepeat node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioRepeat node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioRepeat node process the audio data in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the SaltAudioRepeat node processes the audio data by first reading the audio segment from the 'audio' parameter, then repeating it 'repeat_times' times using the AudioSegment library, and finally returning the looped audio segment as bytes."
