        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_SigmaSchedule node in ComfyUI is used to generate a sigma schedule based on a given beta schedule. It abstracts the complexity of creating a sigma schedule and provides a convenient way to obtain a sigma schedule that conforms to a specific model sampling type and configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The ADE_SigmaSchedule node requires the 'beta_schedule' input, which specifies the beta schedule used to generate the sigma schedule. This parameter is crucial as it determines the basic configuration from which the sigma schedule will be derived."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is a sigma schedule object, which is essential for defining the noise level process in diffusion-based generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node in ComfyUI is 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/sample settings/sigma schedule'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output sigma schedule in the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output sigma schedule in the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is SigmaSchedule, which is a custom type from the animatediff package."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is ADE_SigmaSchedule."
