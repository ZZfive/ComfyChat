        "question": "What is the purpose of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is used for image depth estimation preprocessing. It processes images by selecting and applying depth estimation models suitable for specified environments (indoor or outdoor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is a depth map of the input image, providing pixel-level depth value estimates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional inputs for the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input is an image that needs depth estimation processing. The optional inputs include the environment (indoor or outdoor) and the resolution for the depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the environment parameter affect the depth estimation in Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The environment parameter determines the selection of the pre-trained model for depth estimation, allowing optimization of the depth map's accuracy for either indoor or outdoor environments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the environment parameter in Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the environment parameter is 'indoor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution parameter affect the output of Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution parameter specifies the resolution at which the depth estimation is performed, affecting the resolution of the output depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for running the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is GPU."
