        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffLoraLoader node is designed to conveniently load and apply motion Lora models to a subject. It allows for fine control over animations by blending different Lora models according to specified strengths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'lora_name' parameter in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific motion Lora model to be loaded. It ensures the correct model is selected from the available options, which is vital for the node's operation and the final animation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the animation in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter determines the intensity of the motion Lora's influence on the animation. It is a key factor in fine-tuning the animation to achieve the desired effect, allowing for a balance between different motion layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'prev_motion_lora' parameter play in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_motion_lora' parameter is used to provide the state of the previous motion Lora model. It is important for maintaining continuity in the animation sequence and allows for layering multiple Lora models for complex animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output type 'MOTION_LORA' represent in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type 'MOTION_LORA' represents the resulting motion Lora model after applying the specified strength and blending with any previous motion Lora models. It is essential for subsequent animation steps and serves as the basis for further character animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node blend different Lora models?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffLoraLoader node blends different Lora models by using the specified strength to mix the current Lora model with any previous motion Lora models provided through the 'prev_motion_lora' parameter. This allows for fine control and layering of multiple motion influences in character animations."
