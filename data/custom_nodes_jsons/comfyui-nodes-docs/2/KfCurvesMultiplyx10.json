        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node in ComfyUI facilitates multiplication operations on multiple curves, enhancing the ability to manipulate and combine keyframe data for creating complex animations or simulations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input required by the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node?",
        "answer": "The main input required by the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node is 'curve_0', which is crucial for the multiplication process and serves as the basis for the other curves to be factored in. It ensures that the node can initiate complex operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node enhance the final output's complexity?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node enhances the final output's complexity by incorporating multiple curve inputs (curve_1 to curve_9) as multipliers, each contributing a unique scaling factor to the final animation, thus achieving a higher level of detail and precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node is 'curve_out', which represents the cumulative result of the multiplication of all input curves, providing a single, unified curve that encapsulates the combined effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional curve inputs does the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node have?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node has 9 optional curve inputs, named curve_1 to curve_9, each serving as multipliers to enhance the overall scaling effect of the main curve input, curve_0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node use?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the 'curve_out' in the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the 'curve_out' in the KfCurvesMultiplyx10 node is KEYFRAMED_CURVE in ComfyUI and keyframed.Curve in Python."
