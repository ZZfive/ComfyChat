        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfConditioningAddx10 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfConditioningAddx10 node in ComfyUI is used to accumulate and process conditioning inputs by aggregating the provided inputs to enhance the overall conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cond_0' input in the KfConditioningAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond_0' input is the initial conditioning data which is crucial for the node's operation. It sets the baseline for subsequent aggregation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional conditioning inputs does the KfConditioningAddx10 node have?",
        "answer": "The KfConditioningAddx10 node has 9 optional conditioning inputs, from 'cond_1' to 'cond_9'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'cond_t_out' represent in the KfConditioningAddx10 node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond_t_out' output represents the cumulative result of the conditioning inputs, which is the aggregated and processed data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfConditioningAddx10 node use?",
        "answer": "The KfConditioningAddx10 node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'main' method in the KfConditioningAddx10 class?",
        "answer": "The 'main' method in the KfConditioningAddx10 class accumulates the conditioning inputs by adding the tensors and pooling the outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfConditioningAddx10 node handle optional inputs that are not provided?",
        "answer": "The KfConditioningAddx10 node sets a default value of 0 for optional inputs that are not provided."
