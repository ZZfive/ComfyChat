        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConvertImg node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConvertImg node is designed for explicit image format conversion, allowing specific image formats required by certain custom nodes to be directly used without using workarounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ConvertImg node belong?",
        "answer": "The ConvertImg node belongs to the Bmad/CV category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ConvertImg node are 'image', which is the input image that needs format conversion, and 'to', which specifies the target format of the image conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'to' parameter in the ConvertImg node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'to' parameter in the ConvertImg node specifies the target format of the image conversion, which determines the format of the output image and influences its compatibility and functionality in subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ConvertImg node is an image that has been converted to the specified format, ready for further processing or use in applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ConvertImg node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the image format conversion performed in the source code of the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the ConvertImg node, the image format conversion is performed using the tensor2opencv and opencv2tensor functions, where the image is first converted to the OpenCV format with the specified target format and then back to a tensor."
