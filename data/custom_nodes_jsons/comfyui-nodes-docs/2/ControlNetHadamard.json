        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetHadamard node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetHadamard node in ComfyUI applies a control network to a set of images and conditions, adjusting the conditions based on the control network's output and specified strength. It is designed to achieve dynamic image adjustment, allowing image attributes or styles to be modified according to the logic of the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ControlNetHadamard node are: conds (conditions to be applied to each image), control_net (control network for modifying conditions based on images and specified strength), image (images to which conditions are applied), and strength (strength that determines the influence of the control network on the conditions)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetHadamard node is conditioning, which represents the modified conditions after being processed by the control network, reflecting the applied changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ControlNetHadamard node use?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetHadamard node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node is 0.0, and the maximum value is 10.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the step size for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The step size for the strength parameter in the ControlNetHadamard node is 0.01."
