        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Int_to_Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Int_to_Float node in ComfyUI is designed to convert integer values to floating-point numbers, enabling calculations that require decimal precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of converting integers to floats in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Converting integers to floats is crucial for performing precise calculations that integers alone cannot accommodate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the DF_Int_to_Float node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Int_to_Float node requires an input of type 'Value', which represents the integer to be converted to a floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the 'Value' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'Value' input parameter is INT, and the Python dtype is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Int_to_Float node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Int_to_Float node is a floating-point representation of the input integer, allowing for decimal precision in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the output of the DF_Int_to_Float node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output of the DF_Int_to_Float node is FLOAT, and the Python dtype is float."
