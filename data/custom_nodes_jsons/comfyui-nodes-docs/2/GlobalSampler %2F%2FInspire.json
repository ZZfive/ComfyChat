        "question": "What is the purpose of the GlobalSampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSampler node in ComfyUI represents a system that uniformly samples elements from a given set, ensuring each element has an equal probability of being selected. It is designed to introduce randomness in a fair and unbiased manner, which is crucial for applications that require random behavior or diverse results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the sampler_name parameter in the GlobalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The sampler_name parameter is crucial because it determines the sampling method to be used. It directly influences the operation of the node by deciding which sampling algorithm will be employed, thus shaping the diversity and randomness of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the scheduler parameter play in the GlobalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The scheduler parameter is essential for managing the execution flow of the sampling process. It affects how the node coordinates the timing and frequency of sampling, ensuring that randomness is introduced efficiently without disrupting the overall process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sampled_data output represent in the GlobalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The sampled_data output contains the results of the sampling process, representing the selected elements. It is a key output because it directly reflects the effectiveness of the sampling method and the quality of the randomness achieved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the GlobalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the GlobalSampler node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the GlobalSampler node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the GlobalSampler node is an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the GlobalSampler node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSampler node belongs to the InspirePack/Prompt category in ComfyUI."
