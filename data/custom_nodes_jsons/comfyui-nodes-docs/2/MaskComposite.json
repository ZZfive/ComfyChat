        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskComposite node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskComposite node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various operations on mask images, allowing the combination of source and destination masks based on specified operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the MaskComposite node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the MaskComposite node are: destination, source, x, y, and operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'operation' parameter in the MaskComposite node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' parameter in the MaskComposite node indicates the type of combination to be performed between the source mask and the destination mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'operation' parameter in the MaskComposite node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'operation' parameter in the MaskComposite node are: 'multiply', 'add', 'subtract', 'and', 'or', and 'xor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskComposite node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskComposite node is the result of the mask combination operation, containing the final state of the mask after applying all transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MaskComposite node use?",
        "answer": "The MaskComposite node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskComposite node determine the visible portion of the source mask?",
        "answer": "The MaskComposite node determines the visible portion of the source mask by calculating the intersection between the source mask dimensions and the destination mask dimensions based on the specified x and y parameters."
