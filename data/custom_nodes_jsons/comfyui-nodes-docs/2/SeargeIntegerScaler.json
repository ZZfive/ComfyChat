        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeIntegerScaler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeIntegerScaler node in ComfyUI is used to scale and round input integer values based on a provided factor and multiple, ensuring the output value stays within the desired range and granularity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeargeIntegerScaler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeargeIntegerScaler node are: value (INT), factor (FLOAT), and multiple_of (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the factor input affect the scaling of the input value in the SeargeIntegerScaler node?",
        "answer": "The factor input in the SeargeIntegerScaler node is a multiplier applied to the input value, determining the scale of the output. It directly affects the magnitude of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the multiple_of input do in the SeargeIntegerScaler node?",
        "answer": "The multiple_of input in the SeargeIntegerScaler node ensures that the scaled result is a multiple of the specified value, rounding the output to the nearest acceptable value within the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SeargeIntegerScaler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeargeIntegerScaler node is a single integer value (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the SeargeIntegerScaler node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SeargeIntegerScaler node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SeargeIntegerScaler node located in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeIntegerScaler node is located in the Searge/_deprecated_/Integers category in ComfyUI."
