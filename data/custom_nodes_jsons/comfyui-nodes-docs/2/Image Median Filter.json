        "question": "What is the main purpose of the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Median_Filter node applies a median filter to the input image, which is a non-linear operation that replaces each pixel with the median of the surrounding pixels. This is useful for reducing image noise while preserving edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node is the 'image' parameter, which represents the image data to be processed. It is crucial for the node's execution as it determines the object of the median filtering operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'diameter' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'diameter' parameter specifies the size of the filter kernel used in the median filtering process. It is an important adjustment parameter that affects the degree of noise reduction and the preservation of image details."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sigma_color' parameter influence the filtering process in the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma_color' parameter defines the filter's sensitivity to color variations within the image. It is a key parameter for controlling the color aspects of the filtering process, allowing adjustments based on the specific characteristics of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'sigma_space' parameter play in the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma_space' parameter controls the filter's sensitivity to spatial variations within the image. It is essential for fine-tuning the spatial aspects of the median filtering, ensuring that the operation adapts to the content and structure of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node is the 'output_image', which represents the result of applying the median filter to the input image. It is the processed image with reduced noise and preserved edges, suitable for further analysis or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Image_Median_Filter node is CPU."
