        "question": "What is the purpose of the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node in ComfyUI is designed to perform video frame interpolation using deep learning models. It takes input video frames and generates additional frames in between the existing ones to create smoother transitions and higher quality video output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter is crucial as it determines the specific model weights and architecture used for the frame interpolation process. It affects the quality and style of the interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'frames' parameter in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter contains the input video frames that are necessary for interpolation. These frames are processed to generate intermediate frames, which is essential for achieving the desired video enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter affect the interpolation process in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter determines the frequency at which the CUDA cache is cleared during processing to prevent memory overflow. It strikes a balance between memory usage and processing time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiplier' parameter control in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter determines how many frames are generated between each pair of input frames. A higher multiplier results in a higher output frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter allows for custom control over the interpolation process, such as skipping certain frames or applying specific interpolation techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_frames' parameter represent in the GMFSS_Fortuna_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_frames' parameter contains the interpolated video frames. These frames are the result of the frame interpolation process and represent the enhanced video sequence."
