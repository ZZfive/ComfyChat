        "question": "What is the purpose of the BoolUnaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BoolUnaryOperation node is designed to perform unary operations on boolean values. It accepts a boolean input, applies the specified unary operation, and produces a boolean output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the BoolUnaryOperation node are 'op' and 'a'. 'op' specifies the unary operation to be applied to the boolean input, and 'a' represents the boolean value to which the unary operation will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is expected for the 'op' parameter in the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the BoolUnaryOperation node expects a string (str) data type in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is expected for the 'a' parameter in the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the BoolUnaryOperation node expects a boolean (bool) data type in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BoolUnaryOperation node is 'result', which is the output of the unary operation performed on the input boolean value. It represents the result of the logical operation within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'result' output in the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'result' output in the BoolUnaryOperation node is boolean (bool) in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'infra type' specified for the BoolUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'infra type' specified for the BoolUnaryOperation node is CPU, indicating that the node runs on the CPU infrastructure."
