        "question": "What is the purpose of the dynamicCFGSettings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The dynamicCFGSettings node is designed to dynamically adjust configuration settings for a given pipeline in ComfyUI, optimizing the sampling process based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the dynamicCFGSettings node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the dynamicCFGSettings node include pipe, steps, cfg, cfg_mode, cfg_scale_min, sampler_name, scheduler, denoise, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the steps parameter affect the sampling process in the dynamicCFGSettings node?",
        "answer": "The steps parameter in the dynamicCFGSettings node defines the number of steps to be taken during the sampling process, directly influencing the granularity and duration of the sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the cfg parameter in the dynamicCFGSettings node?",
        "answer": "The cfg parameter in the dynamicCFGSettings node is a floating-point value that adjusts the configuration of the sampling process, affecting the behavior and output quality of the entire process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the dynamicCFGSettings node handle the image_to_latent parameter?",
        "answer": "When the image_to_latent parameter is provided, the dynamicCFGSettings node uses it to convert the image into a latent representation for further processing in the sampling pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the dynamicCFGSettings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the dynamicCFGSettings node is PIPE_LINE, which represents the modified pipeline with the new settings applied, ready for subsequent sampling operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for using the dynamicCFGSettings node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the dynamicCFGSettings node is CPU."
