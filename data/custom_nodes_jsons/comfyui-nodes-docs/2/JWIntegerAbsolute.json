        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWIntegerAbsolute node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerAbsolute node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the absolute value of an integer. It converts negative numbers to their positive counterparts while keeping positive numbers unchanged, ensuring that the output is always non-negative."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the JWIntegerAbsolute node is 'value', which specifies the integer for which the absolute value needs to be calculated. This input determines the magnitude of the output and ensures that the output is non-negative."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the input 'value' in the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the input 'value' in the JWIntegerAbsolute node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the input 'value' in the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the input 'value' in the JWIntegerAbsolute node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWIntegerAbsolute node is 'int', which represents the non-negative absolute value of the input integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the output of the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the output of the JWIntegerAbsolute node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the output of the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the output of the JWIntegerAbsolute node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWIntegerAbsolute node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWIntegerAbsolute node is not an output node in ComfyUI. It is set to 'False' in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWIntegerAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWIntegerAbsolute node is 'CPU'."
