        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComposeVec4 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec4 node is designed to combine four separate floating-point values into a single Vec4 object, playing a crucial role in converting and aggregating spatial or color data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x' parameter represent in the ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' parameter represents the first component of the four-dimensional vector. It is essential for defining the spatial direction or color intensity in the resulting Vec4 object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'y' parameter in the ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'y' parameter represents the second component of the Vec4, contributing to the overall structure of the vector. It is crucial for applications that require a comprehensive representation of spatial or color data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'z' parameter play in the ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'z' parameter represents the third component of the four-dimensional vector. It is a key element in vector construction, especially when representing three-dimensional space or involving color channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'w' parameter signify in the ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'w' parameter is the fourth and final component of the Vec4 object. It typically represents additional information, such as perspective in homogeneous coordinate systems or the alpha channel in color data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ComposeVec4 node is a Vec4 object, which encapsulates the four input parameters into a consistent structure, providing a unified representation for further processing or analysis in downstream operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ComposeVec4 node use?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec4 node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
