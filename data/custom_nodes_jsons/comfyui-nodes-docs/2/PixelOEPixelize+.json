    "doc_content": "ComfyUI supports three common models: stable diffusion model, caching compressed diffusion model, and MAGNUS model. These models are used to generate images and videos. There is also a module for VR composition. Custom nodes and plugins are used to extend the functionality of ComfyUI, with a few plugins being made by Michigan University to support a networked execution.\n\nThe previous stable diffusion model has an O(n) computational complexity, which means it does not scale. The new diffusion model has an O(n^2) complexity and can also be used to generate 3D videos withbs internal compression. However, the new model places a higher computational demand on the device, so it is reported faster for 4K videos. For 8K videos, it is also faster.\n\nThe flexible node documentation page also includes custom interpolators, which allow the parameters to be changed during ejection of the GPU image.\n\nThis documentation page details several common nodes provided with ComfyUI, with properties marked in bold.",
