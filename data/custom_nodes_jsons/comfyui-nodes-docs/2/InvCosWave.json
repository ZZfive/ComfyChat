        "question": "What is the purpose of the InvCosWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvCosWave node in ComfyUI is designed to generate waveforms based on the inverse cosine function. It provides periodic output that can be adjusted using phase, amplitude, and displacement parameters, making it particularly suitable for applications that require smooth oscillation patterns over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the phase parameter in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter in the InvCosWave node determines the period of the waveform. It affects the frequency of the waveform's oscillation and is crucial for setting the temporal frequency of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the output of the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter in the InvCosWave node controls the peak value of the waveform. It is important for defining the magnitude of the oscillation and can be adjusted to scale the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the x_translation parameter in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The x_translation parameter in the InvCosWave node shifts the waveform along the x-axis. It is crucial for positioning the waveform pattern within a given frame or space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the y_translation parameter do in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The y_translation parameter in the InvCosWave node adjusts the vertical position of the waveform. It is important for aligning the waveform pattern with other visual elements or data points."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the current_frame parameter used in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter in the InvCosWave node represents the current time step in an animation or sequence. It is crucial for generating the correct phase of the waveform at any given moment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The InvCosWave node outputs two values: 'output', which is a float representing the current value of the waveform at the specified frame, and 'int_output', which is an integer representation of the waveform value, useful when indexing or integer precision is needed."
