        "question": "What is the purpose of the InvertMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node is designed to invert the values of a binary mask. It plays a crucial role in various image segmentation tasks where inverting the mask is necessary to highlight different regions of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node requires a 'mask' parameter, which is a binary mask that the node will invert. It is essential for the node's operation as it directly determines the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InvertMask node is 'MASK', which represents the inverted version of the input mask. It is important as it provides a binary mask with inverted values that can be used for further processing or analysis in a segmentation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the InvertMask node use?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the InvertMask node invert the input mask?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node inverts the input mask by subtracting it from 1.0, effectively flipping the polarity of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the InvertMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node falls under the 'segment_anything' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the InvertMask node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the InvertMask node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
