        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageDrawLine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawLine node in ComfyUI is used to draw lines on an image. It utilizes the provided dimensions and color specifications to render a line between two points on the image, with customization options such as line thickness, color, and anti-aliasing settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageDrawLine node include width, height, size, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, red, green, blue, alpha, SSAA, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the line drawn by the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter specifies the thickness of the line to be drawn, which plays an important role in the visual effect of the line on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'alpha' parameter control in the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The 'alpha' parameter controls the transparency of the line color, allowing the line drawn on the image to have a transparent effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'SSAA' parameter in the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The 'SSAA' parameter is the super-sampling anti-aliasing factor for the line, which improves the visual quality of the line by reducing jagged edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageDrawLine node is an IMAGE, which is the modified image with the line drawn on it, returned in tensor format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'method' parameter used for in the ImageDrawLine node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter is used to specify the method for resizing the image after drawing the line, which affects the final appearance of the line."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the line drawn on the canvas in the ImageDrawLine node's source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the ImageDrawLine node, the line is drawn on the canvas using the ImageDraw.Draw() function, specifying the start and end coordinates, color, and line thickness."
