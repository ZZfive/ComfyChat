        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to generate random noise patterns that can serve as the source of randomness in various generative models. It acts as the basis for creating synthetic data, ensuring the diversity and unpredictability of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the noise_seed parameter in the RandomNoise node?",
        "answer": "The noise_seed parameter is crucial for the RandomNoise node as it determines the initial state for generating random noise. This ensures that the resulting noise patterns are reproducible, which is essential for generative models to obtain consistent results across different runs."
