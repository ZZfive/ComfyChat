        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_BinaryToBitList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryToBitList node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a binary string into a list of individual bits, allowing for more detailed and accessible manipulation of binary data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected input type for the 'bit_string' parameter in CR_BinaryToBitList?",
        "answer": "The 'bit_string' parameter in CR_BinaryToBitList expects a string containing binary data as input. This string serves as the primary data source for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_BinaryToBitList node?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryToBitList node outputs two types of data: 'list_out', which is a list of strings where each string represents a bit derived from the input binary string, and 'show_help', which is a URL link to documentation for more help."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output in CR_BinaryToBitList provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in CR_BinaryToBitList provides a URL link to a GitHub wiki page where users can find more information on how to use the node and its related features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_BinaryToBitList node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryToBitList node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the list_out generated in the CR_BinaryToBitList node?",
        "answer": "In the CR_BinaryToBitList node, the list_out is generated by converting each bit in the input binary string into a string and compiling these strings into a list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'make_list' function in the CR_BinaryToBitList node?",
        "answer": "The 'make_list' function in the CR_BinaryToBitList node returns a tuple containing two elements: the first is the list_out (a list of strings representing the bits), and the second is the show_help (a string containing a URL to more help)."
