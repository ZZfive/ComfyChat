        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadInstanceScaleUNode is designed to load a specific instance of a ScaleU model from a specified filename. It uses a checkpoint retrieval mechanism to load the model's state and prepares the ScaleU network for subsequent use in the instance diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode is 'model_filename', which specifies the filename of the model to be loaded. This parameter is crucial as it determines which specific ScaleU model instance will be retrieved and loaded for use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode is 'scaleu', which returns a dictionary containing a list of ScaleU model instances that can be readily integrated into the instance diffusion framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadInstanceScaleUNode belongs to the 'instance/loaders' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is LoadInstanceScaleUNode an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, LoadInstanceScaleUNode is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'load_model' function in LoadInstanceScaleUNode do?",
        "answer": "The 'load_model' function in LoadInstanceScaleUNode loads a ScaleU model from the specified 'model_filename', prepares the ScaleU network, and returns a dictionary containing a list of the loaded ScaleU model instances."
