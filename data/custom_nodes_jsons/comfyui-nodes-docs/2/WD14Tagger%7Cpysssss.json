        "question": "What is the purpose of the WD14Tagger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WD14Tagger node in ComfyUI is designed to tag images by classifying the input image data using a specified model and returning relevant tags."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WD14Tagger node are image, model, threshold, and character_threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter determine in the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter determines the specific machine learning model used for the image tagging process in the WD14Tagger node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'threshold' parameter affect the output of the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter sets the minimum confidence level for tags to be included in the output, directly influencing the filtering of tags and determining which ones are considered important enough to be reported."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'character_threshold' parameter in the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The 'character_threshold' parameter refines the tagging process by setting a specific secondary threshold for character-level tags, helping to filter out less relevant character tags and improve the precision of the tagging results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'exclude_tags' parameter in the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The 'exclude_tags' parameter allows specifying tags that should not be included in the output, which is useful for customizing the tagging results according to specific requirements or avoiding certain tags for various reasons."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WD14Tagger node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WD14Tagger node is 'tags', which represents the result of the image tagging process and contains a list of relevant and important tags based on the input image and applied thresholds."
