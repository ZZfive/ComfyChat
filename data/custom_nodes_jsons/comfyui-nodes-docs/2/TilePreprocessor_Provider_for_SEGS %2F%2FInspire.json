        "question": "What is the purpose of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class in ComfyUI is designed to improve the accuracy of image segmentation tasks by preprocessing the input image using a pyramid upsampling method to refine image details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter control in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class?",
        "answer": "The 'pyrUp_iters' parameter controls the number of iterations used in the pyramid upsampling process, which directly affects the level of detail and resolution of the preprocessed image, thereby influencing the quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessed image optimized for segmentation tasks, which serves as input to subsequent segmentation models to ensure they receive the most accurate data possible for reliable and precise results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class is 3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter is 1 and the maximum value is 10."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the step size for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class?",
        "answer": "The step size for the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS class is 1."
