        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapInsideParabolas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapInsideParabolas node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a remapping operation based on the geometric shape of two parabolas in an image. It adjusts the image pixels according to the specified parabolas with the aim of transforming or correcting the perspective or distortion of the image in a way that is consistent with these curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the RemapInsideParabolas node is 'dst_mask_with_i_parabolas', which specifies the target mask containing the parabolas. This mask is crucial for determining the geometry of the transformation and guiding the remapping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapInsideParabolas node is a transformed version of the input image, adjusted according to the geometric shape of the specified parabolas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Comfy dtype' of the required input for RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The 'Comfy dtype' of the required input 'dst_mask_with_i_parabolas' for the RemapInsideParabolas node is 'MASK'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Python dtype' of the required input for RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The 'Python dtype' of the required input 'dst_mask_with_i_parabolas' for the RemapInsideParabolas node is 'numpy.ndarray'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Comfy dtype' of the output for RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The 'Comfy dtype' of the output 'remap' for the RemapInsideParabolas node is 'REMAP'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Python dtype' of the output for RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The 'Python dtype' of the output 'remap' for the RemapInsideParabolas node is 'Dict[str, Any]'."
