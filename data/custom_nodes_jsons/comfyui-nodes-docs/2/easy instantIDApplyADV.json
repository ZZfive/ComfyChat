        "question": "What is the purpose of the instantIDApplyAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The instantIDApplyAdvanced node in ComfyUI aims to improve the quality and specificity of output image processing by integrating various features and control functions. It generates refined results through a combination of complex image processing techniques, control networks, and conditional inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the instantIDApplyAdvanced node are pipe, image, instantid_file, insightface, control_net_name, cn_strength, cn_soft_weights, weight, start_at, end_at, and noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' parameter provide for the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter provides the basic data structure for the image processing workflow in the instantIDApplyAdvanced node. It contains all the necessary information, including positive and negative condition data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cn_strength' parameter in the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'cn_strength' parameter adjusts the influence of the control network on image processing in the instantIDApplyAdvanced node. It plays a key role in balancing the desired control and the natural appearance of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noise' parameter in the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' parameter introduces a degree of randomness into the image processing in the instantIDApplyAdvanced node, helping to achieve more diverse and unpredictable results. This is important for achieving a more natural and less uniform appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the instantIDApplyAdvanced node are pipe, model, positive, and negative."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'positive' output of the instantIDApplyAdvanced node contribute to the pipeline?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' output of the instantIDApplyAdvanced node is a set of conditional data refined or adjusted by the node. It is important for providing feedback to subsequent stages of the pipeline, enhancing the coherence and consistency of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the instantIDApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for running the instantIDApplyAdvanced node is GPU."
