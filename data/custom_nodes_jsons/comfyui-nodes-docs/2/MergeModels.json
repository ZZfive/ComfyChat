    {
        "question": "What does the ratio parameter in the MergeModels node determine?",
        "answer": "The ratio parameter in the MergeModels node determines the balance between the two models during the merging process. The closer the ratio is to 1.0, the more weight the features of the second model have in the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MergeModels node?",
