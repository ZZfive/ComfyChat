        "question": "What is the purpose of the BrushMotion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BrushMotion node in ComfyUI is used to dynamically adjust visual content by scaling and interpolating input motion data according to a specified mask, thereby generating motion effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BrushMotion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BrushMotion node are 'model' (DragNUWA), 'motion_brush' (MotionBrush), and 'brush_mask' (MASK)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter define in the BrushMotion node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in the BrushMotion node defines the basic structure and features of the motion effect to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'motion_brush' parameter in the BrushMotion node?",
        "answer": "The 'motion_brush' parameter in the BrushMotion node provides the raw motion data that will be processed and scaled according to the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'brush_mask' parameter affect the motion effect in the BrushMotion node?",
        "answer": "The 'brush_mask' parameter in the BrushMotion node determines the area of the motion effect that will be modified, ensuring precise control over the visual adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BrushMotion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BrushMotion node is 'results' (MotionBrush), which contains the final motion effect after being adjusted according to the input mask and model specifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the BrushMotion node use?",
        "answer": "The BrushMotion node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
