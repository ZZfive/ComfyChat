        "question": "What is the purpose of the PowerImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PowerImage node enhances images by adjusting their brightness and contrast according to a specified power factor and mode, allowing manipulation of visual elements to meet specific aesthetic or analytical needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PowerImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PowerImage node are IMAGE (the source image to be processed), power_of (a float value controlling the enhancement intensity), and mode (a string determining the type of enhancement to be applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the PowerImage node produce?",
        "answer": "The PowerImage node outputs an IMAGE type, which is the processed image with the applied enhancements, ready for further use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'mode' parameter in the PowerImage node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'mode' parameter in the PowerImage node are 'darken', 'lighten', and 'emphasize both'."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the PowerImage node run?",
        "answer": "The PowerImage node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'power_of' parameter in the PowerImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'power_of' parameter in the PowerImage node controls the intensity of the applied enhancement. Higher values result in more pronounced effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PowerImage node process the input image?",
        "answer": "The PowerImage node processes the input image by iterating over each pixel, applying the specified enhancement mode and power factor to the RGB values, clamping the results, and updating the pixel values in the output image."
