        "question": "What is the purpose of SEGSUpscalerPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SEGSUpscalerPipe is a node in ComfyUI used to increase the resolution of an image using advanced upscaling techniques while maintaining the integrity of semantic segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SEGSUpscalerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for SEGSUpscalerPipe include: image, segs, basic_pipe, rescale_factor, resampling_method, supersample, rounding_modulus, seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, denoise, feather, inpaint_model, and noise_mask_feather."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'supersample' parameter affect the upscaling process in SEGSUpscalerPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'supersample' parameter is a flag that indicates whether to use supersampling techniques for upscaling. Supersampling can improve the sharpness and clarity of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inpaint_model' parameter do in SEGSUpscalerPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_model' parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether to use an inpainting model to fill in missing or damaged areas of the image during upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SEGSUpscalerPipe node?",
        "answer": "The output of SEGSUpscalerPipe is an upscaled image that has been processed to achieve a higher resolution while maintaining the details of semantic segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for running SEGSUpscalerPipe?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running SEGSUpscalerPipe is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noise_mask_feather' parameter in SEGSUpscalerPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_mask_feather' parameter is used to apply feathering to the noise mask, softening its edges. This helps create a more natural appearance for the upscaled image."
