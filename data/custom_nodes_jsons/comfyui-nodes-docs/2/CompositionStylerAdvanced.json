        "question": "What is the purpose of the CompositionStylerAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CompositionStylerAdvanced node provides advanced styling functionality for composition-based text prompts by dynamically inheriting the SDXLPromptStylerAdvanced class. It applies specific style transformations to positive and negative text prompts using predefined menus to enhance their thematic and aesthetic qualities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CompositionStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CompositionStylerAdvanced node are: text_positive_g, text_positive_l, text_negative, composition, negative_prompt_to, and log_prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CompositionStylerAdvanced node handle positive and negative text prompts?",
        "answer": "The CompositionStylerAdvanced node processes both global and local positive text prompts (text_positive_g and text_positive_l) and applies style transformations based on the selected composition option. For negative text prompts, it modifies them according to the chosen negative prompt direction (negative_prompt_to)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CompositionStylerAdvanced node produce?",
        "answer": "The CompositionStylerAdvanced node outputs styled global positive text (text_positive_g), styled local positive text (text_positive_l), combined styled positive text (text_positive), styled global negative text (text_negative_g), styled local negative text (text_negative_l), and combined styled negative text (text_negative)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the CompositionStylerAdvanced node use?",
        "answer": "The CompositionStylerAdvanced node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CompositionStylerAdvanced node log the prompt styling process?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CompositionStylerAdvanced node can log the prompt styling process by setting the 'log_prompt' input to True, which helps with debugging and understanding the applied transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ComfyUI dtype for the 'composition' input in the CompositionStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI dtype for the 'composition' input in the CompositionStylerAdvanced node is COMBO[STRING]."
