    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'op' in Vec2BinaryOperation node define?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'op' defines the type of binary operation to be performed on the input vectors. It is crucial for determining the mathematical operation the node will execute, directly influencing the computation result."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Vec2BinaryOperation node, what does the parameter 'a' represent?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'a' represents the first vector in the binary operation. It is an essential input as it constitutes half of the operands needed for the vector calculation, significantly impacting the final result of the computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the parameter 'b' play in the Vec2BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'b' signifies the second vector involved in the binary operation. Similar to 'a', it is a required input that completes the set of operands necessary for the vector calculation, and its attributes and values are vital for the computation process and the node's ability to produce accurate and meaningful results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output parameter 'result' in Vec2BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'result' contains the outcome of the binary operation performed on the input vectors. It is a critical output as it conveys the final computed value, representing the primary function and purpose of the node in the computational workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Vec2BinaryOperation node use for computation?",
        "answer": "The Vec2BinaryOperation node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type for performing calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for the source code implementation of Vec2BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The source code implementation of Vec2BinaryOperation node is written in Python."
