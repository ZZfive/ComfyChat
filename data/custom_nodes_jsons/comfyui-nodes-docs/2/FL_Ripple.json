        "question": "What is the purpose of the FL_Ripple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FL_Ripple node is used to apply a ripple effect to a set of images by simulating ripple patterns to transform each image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FL_Ripple node is 'images', which is a collection of images to which the ripple effect will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'amplitude' parameter control in the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter defines the height of the ripple waves. A higher amplitude will result in a more pronounced ripple effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frequency' parameter affect the ripple effect in the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' parameter determines the number of ripples in the image. A higher frequency will produce more ripples within a given space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'phase' parameter in the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter adjusts the starting point of the ripple effect, allowing for phase shifts in the wave pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FL_Ripple node is 'image', which represents the image with the applied ripple effect in tensor form."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for running the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the FL_Ripple node is 'GPU'."
