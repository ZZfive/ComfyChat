        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN pipeLoader node in tinyterraNodes framework?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipeLoader node is designed to initialize and manage the loading process of various data pipelines in the tinyterraNodes framework. It abstracts the complexity involved in setting up and configuring data flows, ensuring seamless integration and efficient processing between different stages of the data pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ttN pipeLoader node include: ckpt_name, config_name, vae_name, clip_skip, lora1_name, lora1_model_strength, lora1_clip_strength, lora2_name, lora2_model_strength, lora2_clip_strength, lora3_name, lora3_model_strength, lora3_clip_strength, positive, positive_token_normalization, positive_weight_interpretation, negative, negative_token_normalization, negative_weight_interpretation, empty_latent_width, empty_latent_height, batch_size, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive' input define in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input in the ttN pipeLoader node defines the positive conditioning input for the pipeline, influencing the direction and nature of the data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'negative' input in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' input in the ttN pipeLoader node sets negative conditioning input to provide balance for the positive conditioning, further refining the pipeline output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' input set in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input in the ttN pipeLoader node sets the seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency of pipeline operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ttN pipeLoader node include: pipe, model, positive, negative, latent, vae, clip, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'vae' output in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' output in the ttN pipeLoader node outputs the VAE model integrated into the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ttN pipeLoader node use?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipeLoader node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
