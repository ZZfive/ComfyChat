        "question": "What is the purpose of the TransitionFromSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TransitionFromSize node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a sequence of images that depict a smooth transition from one image size to another. It uses a Bezier curve to control the deformation process, ensuring visually appealing transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the TransitionFromSize node are: image, from_image_width, from_image_height, total_frames, begin_and_end_frames, beiser_point_x, and beiser_point_y."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the TransitionFromSize node represents the source image from which the transition sequence will be generated. It is a crucial input as it defines the content and starting point of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'total_frames' parameter affect the output of the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'total_frames' parameter in the TransitionFromSize node determines the total number of frames in the transition sequence. It influences the duration and level of detail of the deformation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do the 'beiser_point_x' and 'beiser_point_y' parameters play in the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'beiser_point_x' and 'beiser_point_y' parameters in the TransitionFromSize node are control points on the Bezier curve that affect the horizontal and vertical aspects of the transition, respectively. They are key factors in forming the curvature of the deformation path."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the TransitionFromSize node is a sequence of images representing the transition from the original size to the new size. Each frame in the sequence is a result of the deformation process controlled by the Bezier curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the TransitionFromSize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the TransitionFromSize node is CPU."
