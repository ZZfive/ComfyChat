        "question": "What is the main purpose of the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SimpleTextScheduler node is used for managing and scheduling text output in animations based on a predefined set of keyframes and the current frame in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node are 'schedule', which is a string containing the text scheduler keyframe information, and 'current_frame', which is an integer indicating the current position in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule' parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule' parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node represents a string that contains the text scheduler keyframe information, defining the sequence of text changes throughout the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node indicates the current position in the animation sequence, which is crucial for determining which text from the schedule should be displayed at any given moment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node is 'text_out', which represents the text scheduled to be displayed at the current frame, providing dynamic text content that aligns with the progression of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output parameter in the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node provides a URL link to documentation for further help, which is particularly useful for users who need more information on how to use the node or troubleshoot issues."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the CR_SimpleTextScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The CR_SimpleTextScheduler node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
