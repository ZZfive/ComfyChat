        "question": "What is the purpose of the MTB_Constant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MTB_Constant node is designed to output a constant value. It serves as a utility node in the graph, providing a fixed value that can be used as input for other nodes, facilitating the creation of static or dynamic processes based on predefined constants."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the MTB_Constant node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MTB_Constant node is 'Value'. This parameter is crucial for defining the static data that will be passed through the graph, influencing subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types can the 'Value' input parameter of the MTB_Constant node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'Value' input parameter of the MTB_Constant node can accept data types such as str, int, float, dict, list, bool, or None in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MTB_Constant node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MTB_Constant node is the constant value defined by the input parameter. This value is passed through the graph for use by subsequent nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the MTB_Constant node use?",
        "answer": "The MTB_Constant node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the MTB_Constant node?",
        "answer": "The category of the MTB_Constant node is 'mtb/utils'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is MTB_Constant an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the MTB_Constant node is not an output node. It is designated as 'False' for being an output node."
