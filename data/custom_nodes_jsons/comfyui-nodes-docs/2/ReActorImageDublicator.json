        "question": "What is the primary function of the ReActorImageDublicator node in the ReActor suite?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the ReActorImageDublicator node is to create copies of images, which may be presented in list format."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the ability to create multiple instances of the same image important in image processing tasks?",
        "answer": "The ability to create multiple instances of the same image is crucial for operations that require processing or analyzing multiple instances of the same image, thereby enhancing workflows in image manipulation and augmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ReActorImageDublicator node are 'image', which specifies the original image to be copied, and 'count', which determines the number of copies to create from the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'image' input in the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the ReActorImageDublicator node uses the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE', which corresponds to the Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'count' input in the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The 'count' input in the ReActorImageDublicator node uses the Comfy dtype 'INT', which corresponds to the Python dtype 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ReActorImageDublicator node is 'IMAGES', which returns a list of copied images based on the specified count."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type does the ReActorImageDublicator node commonly operate?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator node commonly operates on the 'CPU' infra type."
