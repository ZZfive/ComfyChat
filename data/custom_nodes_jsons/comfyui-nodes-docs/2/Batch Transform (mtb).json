        "question": "What is cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "cg-noise is a custom node in ComfyUI that replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "cg-noise allows for exploration of subtle variations of an image without changing the main subject or details, making it useful for finding the best possible output while maintaining the core elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the weight `x` used in cg-noise?",
        "answer": "In cg-noise, the weight `x` determines the balance between the variation_seed and the original seed. Setting `x` to 0 results in the original image, while setting it to 1 generates a completely different image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the weight `x` is set to 0.5 in cg-noise?",
        "answer": "When the weight `x` is set to 0.5 in cg-noise, the variation is halfway between the original image and a completely different image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can cg-noise be used to generate entirely new images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, cg-noise is designed for exploring subtle variations of an existing image rather than generating entirely new images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two seeds used in cg-noise?",
        "answer": "The two seeds used in cg-noise are the variation_seed and the original seed. The variation_seed is used to generate the noise, while the original seed maintains the main subject and details of the image."
