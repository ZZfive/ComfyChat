        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateMagicMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateMagicMask node is designed to generate a pair of masks with varying complexity and detail. It utilizes procedural generation principles to create visually captivating patterns that can be used in a wide range of applications, from visual effects to artwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frames' parameter in the CreateMagicMask node control?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter determines the total number of frames generated for the mask sequence. It is a key factor in defining the length and complexity of the animation. More frames result in smoother transitions and more complex patterns but also increase the computational load."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'transitions' parameter affect the mask sequence in the CreateMagicMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'transitions' parameter specifies the number of transitions within the mask sequence. Each transition introduces changes in the pattern, contributing to the overall visual dynamics. It influences the diversity and pace at which the mask's appearance evolves over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'depth' parameter play in the CreateMagicMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'depth' parameter controls the level of detail in the generated masks by specifying the number of transformations applied to the base coordinates. Higher depth values enhance the complexity of the patterns, creating more nested and intricate structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'distortion' parameter influence the mask patterns in the CreateMagicMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'distortion' parameter affects the irregularity of the mask patterns. It introduces variability in the generated shapes and forms, allowing for a wide range of visual effects. Higher distortion values can lead to more abstract and unpredictable patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' parameter in the CreateMagicMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring the reproducibility of the mask generation process. It is crucial for obtaining consistent results when re-running the node with the same settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'frame_width' and 'frame_height' parameters define in the CreateMagicMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_width' and 'frame_height' parameters define the width and height of each frame in the mask sequence. They play an important role in determining the resolution and scale of the visual output. Larger frame sizes can accommodate more detail but may require more memory and processing power."
