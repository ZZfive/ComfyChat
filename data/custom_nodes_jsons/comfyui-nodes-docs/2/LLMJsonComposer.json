        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMJsonComposer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMJsonComposer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate valid JSON objects from given text inputs using a language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMJsonComposer node are: llm_model, text_input, and classifier_list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'llm_model' input in the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The 'llm_model' input specifies the language model used to interpret the input text and classifiers to produce the desired JSON output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_input' parameter represent in the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_input' parameter represents the main text data that will be used to compose the JSON object, serving as the foundation for the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'classifier_list' input affect the JSON composition in the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The 'classifier_list' input guides the composition of the JSON by categorizing the input text, influencing the structure and content of the generated JSON."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'extra_directions' input in the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_directions' input provides optional additional instructions for the language model to follow when composing the JSON, allowing for more customized and specific outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMJsonComposer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMJsonComposer node is a string representing the generated JSON object."
