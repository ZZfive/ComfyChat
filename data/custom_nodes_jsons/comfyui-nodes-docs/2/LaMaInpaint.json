        "question": "What is the purpose of the LaMaInpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LaMaInpaint node in ComfyUI is specifically used for object removal and image restoration tasks. It utilizes a deep learning model to fill in reasonable textures and details in missing or unwanted areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LaMaInpaint node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LaMaInpaint node are 'image' and 'mask'. 'image' is the input image tensor that needs to be repaired, and 'mask' is the mask tensor indicating the areas to be repaired."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'device_mode' optional input parameter in the LaMaInpaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'device_mode' optional input parameter in the LaMaInpaint node specifies the device (CPU or GPU) for performing the restoration operation, allowing flexible use of computing resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the LaMaInpaint node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the LaMaInpaint node contains the restored image tensor, where the specified areas have been filled with generated content that matches the surrounding areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the LaMaInpaint an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the LaMaInpaint node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the LaMaInpaint node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the LaMaInpaint node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LaMaInpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LaMaInpaint node in ComfyUI is Art Venture/Inpainting."
