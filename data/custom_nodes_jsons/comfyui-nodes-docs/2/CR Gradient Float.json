        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_GradientFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_GradientFloat node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a smooth transition between two floating-point values over a specified duration. It calculates the current value based on start and end values, the frame at which the transition begins, and the total duration of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_GradientFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_GradientFloat node are: start_value, end_value, start_frame, frame_duration, current_frame, and gradient_profile."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_value' parameter represent in the CR_GradientFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_value' parameter in the CR_GradientFloat node defines the initial value of the gradient. It is crucial for setting the starting point of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frame_duration' parameter in the CR_GradientFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_duration' parameter in the CR_GradientFloat node determines the number of frames over which the gradient transition occurs. It affects the speed of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_GradientFloat node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_GradientFloat node provides two output types: FLOAT and show_help. The FLOAT output gives the calculated value of the gradient at the current frame, representing the current state of the transition. The show_help output provides a URL to the node's documentation page for additional information and guidance on its usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_GradientFloat node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_GradientFloat node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_GradientFloat node calculate the current value of the gradient?",
        "answer": "The CR_GradientFloat node calculates the current value of the gradient based on the start and end values, the frame at which the transition begins, the total duration of the transition, and the current frame number. It uses the specified interpolation method type defined in the 'gradient_profile' parameter to determine how the values between the start and end are calculated."
