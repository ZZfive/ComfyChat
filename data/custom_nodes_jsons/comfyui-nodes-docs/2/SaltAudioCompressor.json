        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioCompressor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioCompressor node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal, making louder sounds smaller and smaller sounds larger, resulting in a more consistent overall volume level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioCompressor node are: audio (the raw audio data to be compressed), threshold_dB (the threshold level in decibels), ratio (the compression ratio), attack_ms (the attack time in milliseconds), and release_ms (the release time in milliseconds)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the threshold_dB parameter affect the audio compression in the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The threshold_dB parameter in the SaltAudioCompressor node determines the point at which compression begins. Sounds exceeding this level will be compressed, affecting the loudness of the audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ratio parameter control in the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The ratio parameter in the SaltAudioCompressor node indicates the degree to which audio exceeding the threshold will be compressed, affecting the strength of the compression applied to the audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the attack_ms parameter influence the compression process in the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The attack_ms parameter in the SaltAudioCompressor node specifies the speed at which the compressor starts working after the audio exceeds the threshold, affecting the responsiveness of the compression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the release_ms parameter in the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The release_ms parameter in the SaltAudioCompressor node defines the speed at which the compressor stops affecting the audio after it drops below the threshold, influencing the smoothness of the audio output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioCompressor node is compressed audio data, which is the direct result of applying compression processing to the input audio."
