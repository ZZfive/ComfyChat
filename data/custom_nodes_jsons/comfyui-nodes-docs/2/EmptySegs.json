        "question": "What is the purpose of the EmptySEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EmptySEGS node in ComfyUI is designed to generate an empty segmentation structure. Its purpose is to provide a baseline or placeholder when no actual segmentation data is available."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the EmptySEGS node when detailed segmentation is not required for the input data?",
        "answer": "The EmptySEGS node is crucial when detailed segmentation is not required for the input data as it ensures the integrity of the workflow while avoiding the introduction of unnecessary complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'input_data' parameter in the EmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "Although the 'input_data' parameter is not required, it can be used to pass additional context or data to the EmptySEGS node if needed. Its purpose may be to enhance the functionality of the node or to integrate with other systems that may require input data to operate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'SEGS' represent in the EmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'SEGS' represents the result of the EmptySEGS node operation. It provides an empty tuple where the first element represents the shape of the segmentation dimensions and the second element is a list that usually contains segmentation data but is empty in this case."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the EmptySEGS node and why is it important?",
        "answer": "The output format of the EmptySEGS node is a tuple where the first element is an integer representing the shape of the segmentation dimensions and the second element is a list that is usually filled with segmentation data but is empty in this case. This output format allows for seamless integration with systems that expect segmentation results, even when no actual segmentation has been performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the EmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the EmptySEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the EmptySEGS node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the EmptySEGS node is: ```class EmptySEGS: @classmethod def INPUT_TYPES(s): return {'required': {}} RETURN_TYPES = ('SEGS',) FUNCTION = 'doit' CATEGORY = 'ImpactPack/Util' def doit(self): shape = (0, 0) return ((shape, []),)```"
