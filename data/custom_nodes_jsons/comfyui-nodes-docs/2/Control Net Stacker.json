        "question": "What is the purpose of the Control Net Stacker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Control Net Stacker node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate control nets and their associated images, strengths, and percentage ranges into a single stack. This functionality is crucial for managing and applying multiple control nets in a sequential or layered manner, thereby enhancing flexibility and efficiency in the image processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Control Net Stacker node include control_net (CONTROL_NET), image (IMAGE), strength (FLOAT), start_percent (FLOAT), and end_percent (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter in the Control Net Stacker node define?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the Control Net Stacker node defines the intensity of the control net's effect on the image, allowing for fine adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start_percent' and 'end_percent' parameters in the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' and 'end_percent' parameters in the Control Net Stacker node specify the starting and ending points of the control net's effect during the image generation process, enabling precise control over the timing of application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the Control Net Stacker node is cnet_stack (CONTROL_NET_STACK), which represents an existing stack of control nets to which the new control net will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Control Net Stacker node is CNET_STACK (CONTROL_NET_STACK), which represents the updated stack of control nets, with each network associated with a specific image, strength, and percentage range, ready for sequential or layered application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Control Net Stacker node is CPU."
