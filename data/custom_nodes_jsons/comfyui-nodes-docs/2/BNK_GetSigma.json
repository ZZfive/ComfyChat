        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the GetSigma node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the GetSigma node is to calculate the sigma value, which is a metric that measures noise or signal-to-noise ratio in the context of generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'model' parameter influence the calculation of the sigma value in the GetSigma node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial as it defines the generative model to be analyzed. It affects the entire processing by determining the source of the data used to calculate the sigma value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'sampler_name' parameter play in the GetSigma node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' parameter determines the method of sampling from the model, which in turn affects the calculation of sigma by influencing the quality and distribution of the sampled data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scheduler' parameter impact the sigma calculation in the GetSigma node?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' parameter is essential as it controls the sampling process, including the denoising process, which directly affects the calculation of sigma by altering the noise level in the sampled data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the output 'sigma' value provide in the GetSigma node?",
        "answer": "The output 'sigma' value represents the change in noise characteristics within the specified step range, providing a measure of the model's performance in terms of noise reduction and signal clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'steps' parameter define in the GetSigma node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter defines the iteration range for calculating the sigma value, influencing the comprehensiveness of the noise analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'start_at_step' and 'end_at_step' parameters affect the sigma calculation in the GetSigma node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_at_step' parameter specifies the starting point for the sigma calculation, determining the initial state of the noise analysis and its evolution within the specified steps. The 'end_at_step' parameter sets the endpoint for the sigma calculation, affecting the final state of the noise analysis and the overall change in sigma within the step range."
