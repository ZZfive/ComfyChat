        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch class in ComfyUI is designed to conditionally select between two input images based on a boolean flag. It acts as a decision node in workflows, allowing image data to be routed to different parts of the system based on the provided boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node are 'clip_vision_a' and 'clip_vision_b', which represent the two image options the node can choose between. The 'boolean' parameter is also important as it acts as the switch determining which image the node returns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip_vision_a' parameter in the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_vision_a' parameter represents the first image option that the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node can select. It is crucial to the decision process as it determines one of the potential outputs based on the boolean flag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip_vision_b' parameter in the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_vision_b' parameter is the alternative image option that the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node may choose when the boolean flag is false. It plays a significant role in the node's functionality by providing a secondary output option."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'boolean' parameter influence the output of the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter acts as the switch that decides which image the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node returns. It is essential for controlling the flow of image data in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node is CLIP_VISION, which represents a single image determined by the boolean flag. It is the result of the node's decision process and is crucial for downstream processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_CLIP_Vision_Input_Switch node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
