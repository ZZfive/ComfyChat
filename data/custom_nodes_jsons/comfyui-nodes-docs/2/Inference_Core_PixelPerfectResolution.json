        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node is designed to calculate the optimal resolution for image generation tasks by resizing the image based on the target dimensions and specified adjustment mode, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node are original_image (numpy array), image_gen_width (int), image_gen_height (int), and resize_mode (combo of strings)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'original_image' input represent in the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'original_image' input serves as the basis for calculating the optimal resolution. It is the starting point of the entire process and determines the basic characteristics of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'image_gen_width' input affect the output of the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_gen_width' input guides the calculation process to achieve the target width dimension. It directly affects the horizontal dimension of the final output image and is one of the key parameters that determine the visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'resize_mode' input in the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'resize_mode' input specifies the resizing mode (such as inner fit, outer fit, etc.) to determine how the image is scaled to meet the target size. This parameter decides how the image maintains its original features during the adjustment process and has an important impact on the final visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output type 'RESOLUTION (INT)' represent in the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'RESOLUTION (INT)' output represents the calculated optimal image dimensions (in integer form), ensuring pixel-perfect resolution. This output represents the optimized image size that maximizes the requirements of the target resolution while maintaining the original image features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Inference_Core_PixelPerfectResolution node is CPU."
