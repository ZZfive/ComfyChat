        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Latent Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Big Latent Switch node is designed to dynamically select one of multiple latent inputs based on specified conditions. It flexibly manipulates latent representations in the computation graph, realizing conditional routing of data between different processing paths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'select' parameter in the Big Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter specifies the index of the latent input to be selected. This parameter determines which of the multiple latent inputs will be actively passed through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'on_missing' parameter define in the Big Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_missing' parameter defines the behavior of the switch when the selected input is missing. It can choose to continue processing the next available input or fallback to the previous input to ensure continuity of operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_i' parameter represent in the Big Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_i' parameter represents one of the multiple latent inputs that can be selected by the switch. The node can handle any number of these inputs and dynamically selects between them based on the 'select' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Big Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Big Latent Switch node is 'selected', which is the latent representation selected based on the specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Big Latent Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Big Latent Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Big Latent Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Big Latent Switch node is 'âœ¨ Dream/ðŸ›  utils/â­† switches'."
