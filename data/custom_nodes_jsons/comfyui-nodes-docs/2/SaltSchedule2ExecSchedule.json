        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to convert an input list into an iterative execution list, transforming the scheduling data into a format suitable for sequential processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is 'list_input', which represents the input list that needs to be converted into an iterative execution list. It is the main data structure for the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'list_input' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'list_input' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is LIST."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'list_input' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'list_input' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is List."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is 'float', which represents the converted scheduling data derived from the input list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output 'float' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output 'float' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output 'float' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output 'float' in the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is List[float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is CPU."
