        "question": "What is the purpose of PromptExtractor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptExtractor node is designed to analyze image files and extract relevant prompt information, which can be used to generate creative prompts or guide the workflow. It processes image metadata to identify the required input and output, and constructs a textual representation of the prompt structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What categories can PromptExtractor node be assigned to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PromptExtractor node can be assigned to the category 'InspirePack/Prompt' in ComfyUI. This category signifies that the node is involved in providing inspiration and generating prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for PromptExtractor node are image, positive_id, negative_id, and info. The image parameter is the main input used for analysis. The positive_id and negative_id parameters help identify the positive and negative aspects of the extract information. The info parameter contains metadata about the image, which is crucial for understanding the prompt's context and structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The PromptExtractor node provides two output types: positive and negative. The positive output represents the extracted information that aligns with the positive_id parameter, providing constructive aspects of the prompt. The negative output captures the information corresponding to the negative_id parameter, helping to refine the process by excluding unnecessary details."

    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for PromptExtractor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the positive_id parameter in PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The positive_id parameter is used to identify the positive aspects of the extracted information. It helps filter the output to include only those details that are beneficial for creatively generating prompts or guiding the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the negative_id parameter in PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The negative_id parameter is used to specify the negative aspects of the extracted information. It assists in refining the output by excluding unnecessary details, ensuring that the extracted prompt data is accurate and relevant to the creative process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected format for the input types in PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The input types in PromptExtractor node are expected to follow a specific format. For instance, the image parameter should be a Comfy dtype of COMBO[sorted_files] and a Python dtype of str. The positive_id and negative_id parameters should be a Comfy dtype of STRING and a Python dtype of str. The info parameter should also be a Comfy dtype of STRING and a Python dtype of str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected format for the output types in PromptExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The output types in PromptExtractor node are expected to be a Comfy dtype of STRING and a Python dtype of str. This format is used to represent the positive and negative outputs, which contain the extracted information based on the positive_id and negative_id parameters."
