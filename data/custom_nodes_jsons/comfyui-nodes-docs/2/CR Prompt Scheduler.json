        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_PromptScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_PromptScheduler node is used to manage and schedule prompts based on keyframes or predefined schedules, allowing for seamless handling of dynamic prompts in animations or other time-based applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_PromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_PromptScheduler node are mode, current_frame, default_prompt, schedule_format, and interpolate_prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' input determine the scheduling method used by the CR_PromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input decides whether to apply the default prompt, follow a keyframe list, or implement a more complex scheduling method based on the selected mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interpolate_prompt' input do in the CR_PromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolate_prompt' input determines whether the node should interpolate between prompts to achieve smoother transitions, enhancing the fluidity of animations or applications using the prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'keyframe_list' input in the CR_PromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_list' input provides a way to define keyframes and their associated prompts when the mode is set to 'Keyframe List', which is crucial for creating prompts for specific frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_PromptScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_PromptScheduler node are current_prompt, next_prompt, weight, and show_help."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_PromptScheduler node handle the default prompt when no specific prompt is scheduled for the current frame?",
        "answer": "When no specific prompt is scheduled for the current frame, the CR_PromptScheduler node uses the default prompt as fallback text to ensure there is always an available prompt."
