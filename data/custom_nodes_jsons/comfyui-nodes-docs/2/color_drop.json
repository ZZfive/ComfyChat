        "answer": "The class name of the node is color_drop."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the color_drop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The color_drop node in ComfyUI processes image data by applying a color drop effect, which enhances the visual features of the input image by flattening the color spectrum."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the color_drop node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the color_drop node is 'images', which is essential for the node's operation as they serve as the basis for the color drop process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the color_drop node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the color_drop node is 'number_of_colors', which affects the granularity of the color flattening effect. A higher value leads to more pronounced color bands in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the color_drop node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the color_drop node is 'Image', which is the image with the applied color drop effect, demonstrating the expected visual enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the color_drop node use?",
        "answer": "The color_drop node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
