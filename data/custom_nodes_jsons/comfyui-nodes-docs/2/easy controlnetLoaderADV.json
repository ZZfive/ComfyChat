        "question": "What is the primary function of the controlnetAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The controlnetAdvanced node is designed to facilitate the application of control networks to modify and enhance image data based on specified conditions. It integrates control signals into the image processing pipeline, allowing for fine-tuning adjustments and conditional transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'pipe' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter is essential as it carries the entire image processing pipeline data, including the model and samples. It is crucial for the node's proper operation and the generation of the expected output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'control_net_name' parameter used?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net_name' parameter specifies the control network used for image processing. It is significant as it determines the type of control applied to the image, impacting the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'control_net' parameter stand for?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net' parameter is an optional control network input that can be directly provided by the user. It offers a customization approach for the control network used in the processing without the need to load from a file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter adjust?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter modulates the intensity of the control network's effect on the image. It is crucial for fine-tuning the extent of the transformations applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_percent' parameter define?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter sets the starting point for the control network's effect on the image. It determines when in the processing pipeline the control begins to apply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end_percent' parameter do?",
        "answer": "The 'end_percent' parameter establishes the end point for the control network's influence on the image, affecting how the control effect gradually fades out at the conclusion of the image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'scale_soft_weights' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_soft_weights' parameter adjusts the softness of the control network's weights, facilitating smoother transitions and less abrupt changes in the image, enhancing the visual quality of the output."
