        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactMinMax node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMinMax node is designed to determine either the maximum or minimum value between two input values, playing a crucial role in decision-making and comparisons within workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the ImpactMinMax node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter is essential for the node's operation as it determines whether to return the maximum or minimum value, directly influencing the decision process of the node to perform the correct comparison based on the specified mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'a' and 'b' parameters represent in the ImpactMinMax node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' and 'b' parameters represent the two operands in the comparison. The comparison between 'a' and 'b' determines the output, and their nature can be very broad, allowing the node to have high flexibility in applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'result' output in the ImpactMinMax node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output provides the result of the comparison between the two inputs. It is important as it represents the final output of the node, which is either the maximum or minimum value based on the 'mode' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactMinMax node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMinMax node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the decision to return the maximum or minimum value made in the 'doit' method of the ImpactMinMax node?",
        "answer": "In the 'doit' method, the decision to return the maximum or minimum value is made based on the 'mode' parameter. If 'mode' is True, the method returns the maximum value between 'a' and 'b'. If 'mode' is False, it returns the minimum value between 'a' and 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ImpactMinMax node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMinMax node is classified in the 'ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test' category in ComfyUI."
