        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskToBBox node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskToBBox node in ComfyUI is used to convert face mask data into bounding box coordinates, which helps locate facial features in an image for further analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the MaskToBBox node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MaskToBBox node is 'mask', which is a tensor representing the face mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the MaskToBBox node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the MaskToBBox node is 'pad', which is an integer that allows adjustment of the bounding box coordinates by padding the edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MaskToBBox node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MaskToBBox node is 'BBOX', which provides a list of tuples, each representing the coordinates of a bounding box."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for running the MaskToBBox node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the MaskToBBox node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'pad' parameter affect the bounding box coordinates in the MaskToBBox node?",
        "answer": "The 'pad' parameter in the MaskToBBox node adjusts the bounding box coordinates by subtracting the pad value from the first two coordinates and adding it to the last two coordinates, if the pad value is not zero."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the MaskToBBox node belong?",
        "answer": "The MaskToBBox node belongs to the 'face_parsing' category."
