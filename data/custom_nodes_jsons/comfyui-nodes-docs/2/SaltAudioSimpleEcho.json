        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleEcho node is used to add an echo effect to audio input in ComfyUI. It allows users to customize the number of echoes, the delay time between each echo, and the attenuation coefficient of each echo."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node are: audio (the main audio input to which the echo effect will be added), times (the number of times the echo effect will be applied), delay_ms (the delay time between each echo in milliseconds), and decay_factor (which controls the volume decay of each subsequent echo)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'times' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node control?",
        "answer": "The 'times' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node specifies the number of times the echo effect will be applied, affecting the richness and complexity of the final audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the delay time between each echo specified in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "In the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node, the delay time between each echo is specified in milliseconds using the 'delay_ms' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'decay_factor' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The 'decay_factor' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node controls the volume decay of each subsequent echo, affecting the fade-out effect over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node is modified audio, which has the echo effect applied, demonstrating enhanced depth and spatial sense."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node commonly run?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleEcho node commonly runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
