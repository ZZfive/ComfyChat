        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChangeChannelCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChangeChannelCount node is designed to modify the number of channels in an image tensor. It can intelligently handle different types of images, such as masks, RGBA, and RGB, and convert them according to the specified type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ChangeChannelCount node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ChangeChannelCount node are 'image' (a tensor representing the image data) and 'kind' (indicating the type of channel conversion to be applied to the input image tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'kind' parameter in the ChangeChannelCount node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'kind' parameter in the ChangeChannelCount node are 'mask', 'RGB', and 'RGBA'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ChangeChannelCount node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ChangeChannelCount node is 'output_image', which is the result of the channel conversion process. It represents the final output of the node, an image tensor with a modified number of channels according to the specified 'kind'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ChangeChannelCount node use?",
        "answer": "The ChangeChannelCount node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChangeChannelCount node handle the 'mask' kind?",
        "answer": "When the 'kind' parameter is set to 'mask', the ChangeChannelCount node converts the input image tensor to a mask using the tensor2mask function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ChangeChannelCount node?",
        "answer": "The ChangeChannelCount node belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category."
