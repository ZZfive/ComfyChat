        "question": "What is the purpose of the RGB to HSV node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RGB to HSV node in ComfyUI is used to convert RGB color values to the HSV color space, separating the hue, saturation, and brightness (lightness) components of the color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the RGB to HSV node?",
        "answer": "The RGB to HSV node requires an input of type 'rgb_color', which represents the RGB color that needs to be converted to the HSV color space. The Comfy dtype for this input is COLOR, and the Python dtype is Tuple[int, int, int]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RGB to HSV node?",
        "answer": "The RGB to HSV node outputs a value of type 'hsv_color', which represents the converted HSV color. The Comfy dtype for this output is HSV_COLOR, and the Python dtype is Tuple[int, int, int]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the RGB to HSV node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the RGB to HSV node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python library function is used by the RGB to HSV node for color conversion?",
        "answer": "The RGB to HSV node uses the 'rgb_to_hsv' function from the 'colorsys' library for color conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'convert' function in the RGB to HSV node do?",
        "answer": "The 'convert' function in the RGB to HSV node takes an RGB color value as input, converts it to the correct format, and then applies the 'rgb_to_hsv' function to obtain the corresponding HSV color value. The function then scales the HSV values to the appropriate ranges and returns the result as a tuple."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the RGB to HSV node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RGB to HSV node belongs to the 'Bmad/CV/Color A.' category in ComfyUI."
