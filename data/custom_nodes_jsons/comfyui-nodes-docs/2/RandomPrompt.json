        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomPrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a diverse set of prompts by combining mutable and immutable text elements. It operates by splitting the provided prompts into separate words or phrases and then reassembling them in various combinations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_count' parameter in the RandomPrompt node control?",
        "answer": "The 'max_count' parameter determines the maximum number of prompts to be generated or sampled. It plays a crucial role in controlling the output size and ensuring the execution of the node aligns with the desired level of diversity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mutable_prompt' parameter contribute to the functionality of the RandomPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'mutable_prompt' parameter is a string that can be changed or combined with other prompts during the node's operation. It is important because it forms the basis of variability in the generated prompts, allowing for a wide range of potential outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'immutable_prompt' parameter in the RandomPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'immutable_prompt' parameter is a fixed string that remains constant during the node's execution. It serves as a constant element to be merged with the mutable prompts to produce a consistent structure in the final set of prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'random_sample' parameter affect the output of the RandomPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'random_sample' parameter indicates whether the node should randomly select a subset of the generated prompts. When enabled, it introduces an element of randomness to the selection process, which can be beneficial for applications requiring a diverse but limited set of prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'seed' parameter in the RandomPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator in the random sampling process. Providing a specific seed value ensures reproducibility of results, allowing the node to achieve consistent outcomes across multiple executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RandomPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RandomPrompt node is a list of text prompts generated by combining mutable and immutable text elements. This output represents the primary result of the node's execution and is crucial for applications that use these prompts for further processing or analysis."
