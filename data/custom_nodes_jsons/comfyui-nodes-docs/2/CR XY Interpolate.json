        "question": "What is the purpose of CR_XYInterpolate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYInterpolate node in ComfyUI is designed to generate gradients on an XY grid. It calculates interpolations along the X-axis and Y-axis, providing smooth transitions between specified start and end points. This node is particularly useful for creating complex gradient patterns and allows annotating grid points with custom labels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the x_columns parameter define in the CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "In the CR_XYInterpolate node, the x_columns parameter defines the number of columns in the grid. It is crucial for determining the horizontal spacing and overall structure of the grid layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the x_start_value parameter affect the gradient calculation in CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "The x_start_value parameter in the CR_XYInterpolate node sets the initial value for the X-axis interpolation. It is important as it establishes the starting point for the gradient calculation on the grid columns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the y_rows parameter in the CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "The y_rows parameter in the CR_XYInterpolate node specifies the number of rows in the grid. It is essential for establishing the vertical structure and spacing within the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the y_step parameter influence the gradient in the CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "The y_step parameter in the CR_XYInterpolate node determines the increment between consecutive Y values in the grid. It is important for controlling the progression of the vertical gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the index parameter do in the CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "The index parameter in the CR_XYInterpolate node is used to reference a specific location within the grid. It determines which interpolated values are calculated and returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the x_annotation_prepend and y_annotation_prepend parameters in the CR_XYInterpolate node?",
        "answer": "The x_annotation_prepend and y_annotation_prepend parameters in the CR_XYInterpolate node allow adding custom prefixes to each X and Y annotation, respectively. This can be used to include additional context or information in the annotations."
