        "question": "What is the purpose of the MorphologicOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MorphologicOperation node provides a comprehensive set of morphological operations for image processing, including erosion, dilation, open, close, gradient, top hat and black hat transformations. It is designed to apply these operations on images, allowing various forms of structural modifications and analysis in the context of binary images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MorphologicOperation node are: src (source image), operation (specific morphological operation to apply), kernel_type (shape of the kernel used in the operation), kernel_size_x (horizontal dimension of the kernel), kernel_size_y (vertical dimension of the kernel), and iterations (number of times the operation is applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'operation' input determine in the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' input in the MorphologicOperation node determines the specific morphological operation to be applied, such as erosion or dilation, which affects the structural transformation of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'kernel_type' input influence the morphological operation in the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_type' input in the MorphologicOperation node specifies the shape of the kernel used in the morphological operation, which influences the nature of the transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'kernel_size_x' and 'kernel_size_y' inputs in the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_size_x' and 'kernel_size_y' inputs in the MorphologicOperation node determine the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the kernel, respectively, which affect the range and depth of the morphological transformation on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iterations' input affect the morphological operation in the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' input in the MorphologicOperation node determines the number of times the morphological operation is applied, allowing for progressive structural changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MorphologicOperation node is the processed image after applying the specified morphological operation, reflecting the structural changes made."
