        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLatentMuxer3 node is used to manage latent data flow by selecting one of the three provided latent inputs based on the value of the input selector, which is crucial for controlling data flow direction in complex networks that require conditional routing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node are: input0, input1, input2, which are all latent data type inputs, and input_selector, which is an integer parameter that decides which latent input is selected as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the input_selector parameter do in the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The input_selector parameter is an integer that determines which of the three latent inputs (input0, input1, or input2) is selected as the output, directly affecting the routing decision in the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node is 'LATENT', which carries the selected latent input based on the value of the input selector, and this output will continue to be transmitted through the network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLatentMuxer3 node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node determine which input to output?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLatentMuxer3 node determines which input to output based on the value of the input_selector. If input_selector is 1, it outputs input1; if input_selector is 2, it outputs input2; otherwise, it outputs input0."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node is not an output node. It is a node used for controlling data flow direction within a network."
