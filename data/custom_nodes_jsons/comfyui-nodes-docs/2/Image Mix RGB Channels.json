        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node is designed to merge separate color channels into a single RGB image. It plays a key role in image processing by generating a full-color image through the merging of red, green, and blue channels, thereby enhancing the visual output for further analysis or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node are red_channel, green_channel, and blue_channel. Each of these parameters is essential for representing the respective color components in the final RGB image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the red_channel parameter in the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node?",
        "answer": "The red_channel parameter is crucial as it represents the red component of the final RGB image. It significantly affects the color balance and overall appearance of the merged image, contributing to the core functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the green_channel parameter in the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node?",
        "answer": "The green_channel parameter is essential for creating the RGB image as it determines the green component. It is indispensable for achieving the desired color representation and the visual quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the blue_channel parameter in the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node?",
        "answer": "The blue_channel parameter defines the blue component of the RGB image. It is a key element in the node operation, ensuring correct hues and enhancing the realism of the image in the final merged result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node is merged_image, which represents the final product of the node, a fully merged RGB image. It is important as it encapsulates the purpose of the node, presenting the combined visual data in a coherent and visually pleasing manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_RGB_Merge node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
