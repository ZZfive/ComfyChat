        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSetKeyframe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSetKeyframe node is designed to manage and modify scheduled keyframe conditions, allowing dynamic adjustments to parameters during the model training process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'keyframed_condition' parameter in the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframed_condition' parameter is crucial as it defines the keyframe conditions that are essential for controlling the model's behavior at specific intervals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'schedule' parameter in the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule' parameter is important for defining when and how often the model updates, and together with the keyframe conditions, it can optimize the training process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfSetKeyframe node is a modified schedule containing updated keyframe conditions, which is crucial for guiding the model's progress and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfSetKeyframe node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The KfSetKeyframe node has two input types: 'keyframed_condition' (required) and 'schedule' (optional)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types for the KfSetKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The KfSetKeyframe node returns a 'SCHEDULE' type."
