        "question": "What is the purpose of the VAEEncodeBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAEEncodeBatch node is designed to perform batch processing of images using a specified VAE model, encoding them into latent space representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the VAEEncodeBatch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the VAEEncodeBatch node are 'inputs_len' (INT) and 'vae' (VAE)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter specify in the VAEEncodeBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter specifies the number of images to be encoded in a batch, controlling the iteration of images and subsequent encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'vae' parameter in the VAEEncodeBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter is crucial as it determines the VAE model used to encode the images into latent space representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the VAEEncodeBatch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the VAEEncodeBatch node is 'latent', which represents the encoded latent space representation of the batch of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the VAEEncodeBatch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the VAEEncodeBatch node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VAEEncodeBatch node process multiple images in a batch?",
        "answer": "The VAEEncodeBatch node processes multiple images by iterating through the specified number of images, encoding each image using the VAE model, and concatenating the latent representations."
