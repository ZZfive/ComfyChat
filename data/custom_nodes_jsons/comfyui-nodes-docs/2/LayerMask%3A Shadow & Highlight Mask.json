    "content": "ComfyUI - Nodes\n\nComfyUI is a GUI that utilizes stable diffusion models to produce images and videos. Custom nodes and plugins are optional extras that can be added to extend ComfyUI's functionality beyond its default behavior.\n\nA specific custom node example is the ComfyUI-Manager extension. It is a plugin that allows for manual control and management of the GPU memory usage during processing. This helps prevent the system from running out of memory, improving overall performance and stability.\n\nComfyUI ships with a handful of basic plugins out-of-the-box, which provides core functionality. However, the addition of custom nodes and plugins can lead to a much more powerful and tailored system.\n\n### ComfyUI Nodes\n\nNodes are the fundamental units that perform specific tasks within ComfyUI. They can be connected to form complex pipelines that generate detailed and sophisticated media files.\n\nFor example, `ComfyUI-Sampler` is a node that generates sample frames of the final composition, which can be used for previewing or as part of an interactive system.\n\nAnother node is `ComfyUI-Filter`, which applies post-processing effects on the output frames, such as resizing, cropping, or color adjustments.\n\nThe `ComfyUI-Storage` node manages the storage and retrieval of the generated media files, ensuring that they are saved in a consistent format and location.\n\n#### Additional Information\n\nComfyUI does not require users to touch any code level code to extend its functionality. All custom nodes/extensions are delivered as an out-of-the-box plugin that is easy to install and use.",
