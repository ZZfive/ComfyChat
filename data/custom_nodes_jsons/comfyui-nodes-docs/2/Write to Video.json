        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Video_Writer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Video_Writer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate videos from a sequence of images. It provides the ability to adjust transition frames, control frames per second (FPS), and set delays between images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Video_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Video_Writer node are 'image', which is a sequence of input images used in the video creation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'transition_frames' parameter affect the video created by WAS_Video_Writer?",
        "answer": "The 'transition_frames' parameter in WAS_Video_Writer determines the number of transition frames between images. A higher value results in smoother transitions but increases the video duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image_delay_sec' parameter control in the WAS_Video_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_delay_sec' parameter in the WAS_Video_Writer node controls the delay in seconds before each image transitions to the next. It affects the playback speed of the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the WAS_Video_Writer node produce?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Video_Writer node produces three output types: 'IMAGE_PASS', which is the concatenated sequence of images forming the video content; 'filepath_text', which is the file path where the video is saved; and 'filename_text', which is the filename of the saved video."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the video's maximum size be controlled in the WAS_Video_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The video's maximum size can be controlled in the WAS_Video_Writer node using the 'max_size' parameter, which may result in resizing the images to fit this constraint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'codec' parameter in the WAS_Video_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The 'codec' parameter in the WAS_Video_Writer node specifies the codec used for video encoding. It affects the video format and compression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'fps' parameter in the WAS_Video_Writer node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'fps' parameter in the WAS_Video_Writer node is 30."
