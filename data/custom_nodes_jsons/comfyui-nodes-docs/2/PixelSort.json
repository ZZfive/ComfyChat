        "question": "What is the purpose of the PixelSort node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PixelSort node in ComfyUI introduces creative pixel sorting effects to images, reorganizing pixel data based on criteria such as hue, saturation, or brightness, enhancing the visual impact of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PixelSort node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PixelSort node are: image (provides the source data for the pixel sorting process), mask (defines the areas of the image that should be affected by the pixel sorting effect), direction (determines the axis of pixel sorting, can be horizontal or vertical), sort_by (determines the standard for pixel sorting, such as hue, saturation or brightness), and order (specifies the direction of sorting, either ascending (forward) or descending (backward))."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'span_limit' parameter do in the PixelSort node?",
        "answer": "The 'span_limit' parameter in the PixelSort node refines the sorting by controlling the number of spans in each direction, affecting the granularity of the pixel sorting effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the PixelSort node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the PixelSort node is an image, which is the result of the pixel sorting process, reflecting the creative transformation applied to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the PixelSort node use?",
        "answer": "The PixelSort node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sort_by' parameter affect the pixel sorting in the PixelSort node?",
        "answer": "The 'sort_by' parameter in the PixelSort node determines the standard for pixel sorting, such as hue, saturation or brightness, shaping the final visual result of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the PixelSort node, what does the 'order' parameter specify?",
        "answer": "In the PixelSort node, the 'order' parameter specifies the direction of sorting, either ascending (forward) or descending (backward), changing the arrangement of pixels."
