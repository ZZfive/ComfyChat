    {
        "question": "How does the SSAA parameter affect the output image quality in the ImageDrawRectangle node?",
        "answer": "The SSAA (Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing) parameter improves the output image quality by reducing the jagged edges effect in the ImageDrawRectangle node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the method parameter specify in the ImageDrawRectangle node?",
        "answer": "The method parameter in the ImageDrawRectangle node specifies the resampling algorithm used when resizing the image, affecting the quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageDrawRectangle node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageDrawRectangle node is an image tensor, reflecting the modifications made to the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the rectangle drawn on the canvas in the ImageDrawRectangle node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageDrawRectangle node, the rectangle is drawn on the canvas using the specified start and end coordinates, fill and outline colors, and outline size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the fill_alpha and outline_alpha parameters in the ImageDrawRectangle node?",
        "answer": "The fill_alpha and outline_alpha parameters in the ImageDrawRectangle node allow controlling the opacity of the fill and outline colors of the rectangle."
