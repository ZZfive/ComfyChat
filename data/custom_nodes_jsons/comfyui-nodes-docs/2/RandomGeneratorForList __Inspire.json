        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomGeneratorForList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node is designed to generate a sequence of random values based on a given seed and unique identifier, ensuring that each sequence is unique to its identifier and reproducible across different executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RandomGeneratorForList node are 'signal' and 'seed'. The 'signal' input acts as the trigger for the random generation process, while the 'seed' input determines the starting point for the random number generation to ensure reproducibility of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'signal' input in the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' input in the RandomGeneratorForList node acts as the trigger for the random generation process, ensuring that the node's operation is initiated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'seed' input in the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'seed' input in the RandomGeneratorForList node is 'INT' in ComfyUI, and 'int' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the RandomGeneratorForList node are 'signal' and 'random_value'. The 'signal' output is passed through unchanged, acting as a continuity element in the node operation, while the 'random_value' output is a newly generated random number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the RandomGeneratorForList node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RandomGeneratorForList node ensure reproducibility of the random sequence?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node ensures reproducibility of the random sequence by using a combination of the provided seed and a counter associated with the unique identifier. The counter is incremented for each generated value, and the seed is used in conjunction with the counter to seed the random number generator."
