        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_fDOF node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_fDOF node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a depth of field effect to images, enhancing the visual focus on the subject by blurring the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_fDOF node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_fDOF node are the image parameter, which is the input image to which the depth of field effect will be applied, and the depth parameter, which provides a depth map to determine the areas of the image that should be in focus or blurred."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be adjusted in the WAS_Image_fDOF node?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters that can be adjusted in the WAS_Image_fDOF node include the mode parameter, which determines the type of blur to be applied (mock, gaussian, or box); the radius parameter, which defines the range of the blur effect; and the samples parameter, which specifies the number of times the blur effect is applied to increase smoothness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the WAS_Image_fDOF node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_fDOF node represents the final processed image with the depth of field effect applied. It is the direct result of the node's operation and reflects the creative intent of the applied filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the mode parameter in the WAS_Image_fDOF node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The mode parameter in the WAS_Image_fDOF node determines the style of the depth of field effect by offering options such as mock, gaussian, or box blur, each providing a different aesthetic to the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the radius parameter in the WAS_Image_fDOF node?",
        "answer": "The radius parameter in the WAS_Image_fDOF node defines the range of the blur effect, directly influencing the appearance of the blurred areas in the output image and controlling the intensity of the depth of field."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the samples parameter influence the execution of the WAS_Image_fDOF node?",
        "answer": "The samples parameter in the WAS_Image_fDOF node specifies the number of times the blur effect is applied, which can increase the smoothness of the blur. It affects the execution of the node by determining the level of detail in the final composite image."
