        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Stitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Stitch node in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly combine two images according to a specified stitching direction. It applies a feathering effect to create a smooth transition between the images, which is particularly useful for creating panoramic images or textures."

    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Stitch node are image_a and image_b. image_a is the first image to be stitched and serves as the base layer for the stitching operation. image_b is the second image to be stitched and will be aligned and blended with the first image according to the specified stitching mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the WAS_Image_Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the WAS_Image_Stitch node are stitch and feathering. stitch determines the direction in which the two images should be stitched together (top, left, bottom, or right). feathering determines the amount of feathering applied at the stitching boundary, with higher values producing a softer, more gradual transition between the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Stitch node is stitched_image. It is the resulting image after the stitching process, which combines the two input images into a single, seamless image based on the specified stitching mode and feathering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the WAS_Image_Stitch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Stitch node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum feathering allowed for the WAS_Image_Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The maximum feathering allowed for the WAS_Image_Stitch node is 2048."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the valid stitch modes for the WAS_Image_Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The valid stitch modes for the WAS_Image_Stitch node are top, left, bottom, and right."
