        "question": "What is the purpose of the BasicGuider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BasicGuider node is responsible for generating a guider object to assist in the sampling process. It is designed to integrate with the model and apply conditions to guide the sampling towards desired results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BasicGuider node?",
        "answer": "The BasicGuider node requires two input types: 'model' and 'conditioning'. The 'model' parameter is crucial as it defines the underlying model that the guider will operate on. The 'conditioning' input provides the conditions that will be used to guide the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BasicGuider node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BasicGuider node is 'guider', which represents the configured guider object based on the provided model and conditions. This guider will be used to guide the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the BasicGuider node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the BasicGuider node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the BasicGuider node?",
        "answer": "The BasicGuider node belongs to the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/guiders'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the get_guider function in the BasicGuider node do?",
        "answer": "The get_guider function in the BasicGuider node takes the 'model' and 'conditioning' inputs and returns a configured guider object. It creates a Guider_Basic object with the provided model and sets the conditions using the conditioning input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the get_guider function in the BasicGuider node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the get_guider function in the BasicGuider node is a tuple containing the configured 'guider' object."
