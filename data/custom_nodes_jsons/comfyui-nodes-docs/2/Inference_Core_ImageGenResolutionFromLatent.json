        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the image generation resolution based on a latent space representation. It extracts the height and width from the latent sample and scales them to determine the optimal resolution for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node is 'latent', which is a latent representation used to derive the image generation resolution. It influences the output by determining the base dimensions that will be scaled to calculate the final image resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node outputs two values: 'IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH (INT)' and 'IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT (INT)', which represent the width and height of the image generation in pixels, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node calculate the image generation resolution?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node calculates the image generation resolution by extracting the height (H) and width (W) from the latent sample's shape and multiplying them by 8 to determine the optimal resolution for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node's 'execute' function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromLatent node's 'execute' function is a tuple containing two integers, representing the width and height of the image generation in pixels."
