        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMGroqModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMGroqModel node in ComfyUI is designed to integrate with the Groq platform for loading and managing language models. It encapsulates the functionality of initializing language models and their corresponding embedding models, providing a smooth process for integrating Groq's AI capabilities into various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LLMGroqModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LLMGroqModel node are 'model', which specifies the name of the language model to load, 'groq_api_key', which is the API key for authentication on the Groq platform, and 'embedding_model', which defines the name of the embedding model to be used with the language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'embedding_model' parameter in the LLMGroqModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'embedding_model' parameter in the LLMGroqModel node is important for tasks that require semantic understanding of text, such as similarity search or text classification. It defines the name of the embedding model to be used with the language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the LLMGroqModel node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the LLMGroqModel node is 'openai_api_key', which is the API key for the OpenAI service, used when the embedding model is based on OpenAI technology."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LLMGroqModel node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the LLMGroqModel node are 'llm_model', which returns the initialized language model including its configuration and state, ready for use in various applications, and 'embed_model_only', which provides the initialized embedding model separately, including its name, for tasks requiring semantic analysis of text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the LLMGroqModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the LLMGroqModel node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LLMGroqModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LLMGroqModel node in ComfyUI is 'SALT/Language Toolkit/Loaders'."
