        "question": "What is the purpose of the ModelAdd node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ModelAdd node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two different models into a single, unified model. It does this by cloning one model and then integrating key patches from the second model, ensuring the resulting model embodies features from both original models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'model1' parameter in the ModelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The 'model1' parameter in the ModelAdd node is the first model that will be cloned and used as the base for the merging process. It is the foundation because it determines the initial structure and properties of the final merged model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'model2' parameter in the ModelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The 'model2' parameter in the ModelAdd node represents the second model from which key patches will be extracted and applied to 'model1'. These patches help enhance the merged model with additional functionalities and capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'merge' method in the ModelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'merge' method in the ModelAdd node is a single model that has been merged from the input models. This model now encapsulates the combined strengths and features of the two original models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ModelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ModelAdd node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ModelAdd node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ModelAdd node belongs to the 'advanced/model_merging' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ModelAdd node merge the two models?",
        "answer": "The ModelAdd node merges the two models by first cloning 'model1', then extracting key patches from 'model2' that are related to 'diffusion_model.' and adding these patches to the cloned model with a weight of 1.0 for both the patch and the model."
