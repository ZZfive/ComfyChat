        "question": "What is the purpose of the LaMa custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LaMa custom node in ComfyUI is used to erase objects from an image based on an image mask. It encapsulates the functionality of IOPaint, which is supported by SOTA AI models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different models available in the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The LaMa custom node provides the following models: LaMa, LDM, ZITS, MAT, FcF, Manga, and SPREAD."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LaMa custom node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE), mask (Comfy dtype: MASK), lama_model (Comfy dtype: STRING_ONEOF), device (Comfy dtype: STRING_ONEOF), invert_mask (Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN), mask_grow (Comfy dtype: INT), and mask_blur (Comfy dtype: INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'device' input parameter in the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The 'device' input parameter specifies whether to use CUDA or CPU for processing. Using CUDA will significantly improve the running speed when torch and Nvidia CUDA drivers are properly installed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask_grow' parameter affect the image mask in the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_grow' parameter controls the expansion of the image mask. A positive value expands the mask outward, while a negative value shrinks it inward."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LaMa custom node is the repaired image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the LaMa custom node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the LaMa custom node is CPU."
