        "question": "What is the purpose of the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DragNUWARunMotionBrush node in ComfyUI simulates dynamic effects by applying inferred motion from a motion brush input to a static image, aiming to enhance the visual expressiveness of motion in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node are: model (DragNUWA), image (IMAGE), motion_brush (MotionBrush), inference_batch_size (INT), and motion_bucket_id (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the inference_batch_size parameter affect the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node's processing?",
        "answer": "The inference_batch_size parameter optimizes the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node's processing by controlling the batch size during the inference process, affecting the computational efficiency and speed of motion simulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the motion_bucket_id parameter identify in the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node?",
        "answer": "The motion_bucket_id parameter identifies the specific motion data to be used for simulation from the motion bucket, guiding the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node in creating the desired visual result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node is an enhanced image or a series of images visually representing the applied motion effect on the input image, showcasing the node's ability to simulate dynamic visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the run_inference function in the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node do?",
        "answer": "The run_inference function in the DragNUWARunMotionBrush node processes the input image by resizing and cropping it, then applies the motion effect using the provided motion brush and model, finally returning the enhanced image with the simulated motion effect."
