        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a reverse barrel distortion effect to images, correcting images that have barrel distortion due to imperfect lenses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the coefficient 'a' affect in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'a' affects the primary distortion effect and plays a crucial role in the reverse barrel distortion correction process. Its value directly changes the curvature of the image, influencing the strength of the applied correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the coefficient 'b' contribute to the distortion effect in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'b' modifies the distortion effect along with 'a' and 'c', helping to fine-tune the reverse barrel distortion. It adjusts the mid-course distortion, balancing the correction between the center and edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the coefficient 'c' in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'c' works in conjunction with 'a' and 'b' to adjust the distortion effect and is crucial for achieving the desired reverse barrel distortion correction. It mainly affects edge distortion, fine-tuning the extent of the correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_inverse_variant' parameter determine in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_inverse_variant' parameter, a boolean, determines whether to use the inverse variant of the distortion formula, impacting the overall distortion correction. Choosing the inverse variant alters the correction method, potentially leading to different visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional coefficient 'd' in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The optional coefficient 'd' further refines the distortion effect, providing additional control for the reverse barrel distortion correction. When specified, it offers a higher degree of customization for the correction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node is a remapped image with the reverse barrel distortion applied, correcting the original distortion. The processed image should display straighter lines and more accurate geometric shapes, especially in the edge regions of the image."
