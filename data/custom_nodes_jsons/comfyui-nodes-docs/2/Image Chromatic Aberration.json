        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a chromatic aberration effect to an input image, simulating the optical phenomenon where colors are not focused at the same point due to lens imperfections."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'red_offset' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The 'red_offset' parameter allows for adjusting the offset of the red channel by moving the red component of the image to create the chromatic aberration effect. It is an important part of achieving the desired visual distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'intensity' parameter affect the chromatic aberration effect in the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity' parameter controls the strength of the chromatic aberration effect. Higher values will result in a more pronounced effect, while lower values will produce a subtler distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'fade_radius' parameter play in the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The 'fade_radius' parameter defines the radius of the fade-out effect at the edges of the image. It helps create a smooth transition between the chromatic aberration and the undistorted center of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node is an IMAGE, which represents the result of applying the chromatic aberration effect to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Chromatic_Aberration node are 'image', 'red_offset', 'green_offset', 'blue_offset', 'intensity', and 'fade_radius'."
