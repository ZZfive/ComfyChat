        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Padding node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Padding node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance images by adding padding to the edges, which is useful for various image processing tasks such as data augmentation or preparing images for machine learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'feathering' parameter in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'feathering' parameter in the WAS_Image_Padding node determines the degree of feathering effect applied to the edges of the image padding. It is an optional parameter that can enhance the visual smoothness of the padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'feather_second_pass' parameter affect the image padding in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'feather_second_pass' parameter in the WAS_Image_Padding node controls whether a second pass of feathering is applied to the image. This can add an additional layer of smoothness to the edges of the padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'left_padding' and 'right_padding' parameters in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'left_padding' and 'right_padding' parameters in the WAS_Image_Padding node specify the amount of padding to be added to the left and right sides of the image, respectively. They are important parameters as they directly affect the final dimensions of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'top_padding' and 'bottom_padding' parameters influence the image padding in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'top_padding' and 'bottom_padding' parameters in the WAS_Image_Padding node determine the amount of padding to be added to the top and bottom of the image, respectively. They are key parameters for adjusting the vertical dimensions of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'padded_image' output represent in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'padded_image' output in the WAS_Image_Padding node represents the original image with the specified padding applied. It is the final result of the image padding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'padding_mask' output provide in the WAS_Image_Padding node?",
        "answer": "The 'padding_mask' output in the WAS_Image_Padding node provides a visual representation of the padding applied to the image. It can be used for further processing or visual inspection."
