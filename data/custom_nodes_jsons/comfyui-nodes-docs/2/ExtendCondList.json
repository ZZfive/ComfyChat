        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendCondList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendCondList node in ComfyUI is used to extend a condition list by adding new condition elements to an existing list, allowing for dynamic expansion of condition data for various calculation models or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ExtendCondList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in the ExtendCondList node represents the number of condition elements to be added to the existing list. It plays a crucial role in expanding the list capacity and incorporating new condition data, significantly influencing the execution and results of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type corresponding to the 'inputs_len' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python data type corresponding to the 'inputs_len' parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ExtendCondList node?",
        "answer": "The ExtendCondList node outputs an extended list of condition elements, integrating the newly added samples into the existing list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output conditioning in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the output conditioning is CONDITIONING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type corresponding to the output conditioning?",
        "answer": "The Python data type corresponding to the output conditioning is List[Conditioning]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the ExtendCondList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the ExtendCondList node is CPU."
