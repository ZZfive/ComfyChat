        "question": "What is the purpose of the PiDiNetPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PiDiNetPreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images using the PiDiNet model to extract soft edge lines, enhancing image analysis and processing tasks by providing refined inputs for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by the PiDiNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the PiDiNetPreprocessor node is an image that needs to be processed to extract soft edge lines. This is the main data for the node's operation, aimed at enhancing its features for subsequent analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'safe' parameter in the PiDiNetPreprocessor node control?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' parameter in the PiDiNetPreprocessor node is a mode selector that determines whether the operation is executed in safe mode. Enabling 'safe' mode ensures that preprocessing adheres to safety constraints, which may affect the fidelity and detail of the output, reducing risks during the processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the PiDiNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the PiDiNetPreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the image is processed. Higher resolutions result in more detailed soft edge line extraction, while lower resolutions may speed up processing but sacrifice detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the PiDiNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the PiDiNetPreprocessor node is the processed image with extracted soft edge lines, which can be used for further analysis or processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the PiDiNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the PiDiNetPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which common node is often used in conjunction with the PiDiNetPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvanced node is commonly used in conjunction with the PiDiNetPreprocessor node."
