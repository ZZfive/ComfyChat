        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec4UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a unary operation on a 4-dimensional vector. It evaluates a condition on each component of the vector and returns a single boolean result indicating whether all components satisfy the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'op' parameter in the Vec4UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec4UnaryCondition node defines the unary condition to be applied to each component of the vector. It is crucial as it determines the nature of the conditional check performed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'a' parameter in the Vec4UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec4UnaryCondition node is of data type Vec4, representing the 4-dimensional vector on which the unary condition will be evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Vec4UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Vec4UnaryCondition node is BOOL, indicating that it returns a boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the returned boolean value from the Vec4UnaryCondition node represent?",
        "answer": "The returned boolean value from the Vec4UnaryCondition node represents whether the unary condition applied to all components of the input vector evaluates to true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the Vec4UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the Vec4UnaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Vec4UnaryCondition node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4UnaryCondition node is classified under the 'math/vec4' category in ComfyUI."
