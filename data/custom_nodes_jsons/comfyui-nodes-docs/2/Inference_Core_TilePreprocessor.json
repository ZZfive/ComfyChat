        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tile Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Tile Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image input by applying a tiling mechanism for further processing. It involves detecting and adjusting image tiles to improve the quality and consistency of the input image in subsequent stages of the pipeline, especially in ControlNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Tile Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Tile Preprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed and enhanced. It serves as the main data for performing tile detection and adjustment operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter 'pyrUp_iters' in the Tile Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter 'pyrUp_iters' in the Tile Preprocessor node specifies the number of iterations for the pyramid upsampling process, affecting the granularity of tile adjustment. This parameter plays a key role in deciding the level of detail and scale of the adjustments applied to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional input parameter 'resolution' in the Tile Preprocessor node determine?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter 'resolution' in the Tile Preprocessor node determines the target resolution of the output image, affecting the final dimensions and level of detail after processing. It decides how the image is resized during the preprocessing step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Tile Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Tile Preprocessor node is an image, which is an enhanced version of the input image with tile adjustments applied to improve its suitability for subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Tile Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Tile Preprocessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python class is used in the source code of the Tile Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Python class used in the source code of the Tile Preprocessor node is TileDetector from the controlnet_aux.tile module."
