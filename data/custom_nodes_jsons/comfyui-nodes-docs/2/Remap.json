        "question": "What is Remap?",
        "answer": "Remap is a custom node in ComfyUI that is designed to transform images by applying specific remapping operations. It serves as a base class for more specialized remapping operations like adjusting perspective or distorting images to achieve desired visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type of the Remap Node?",
        "answer": "The Remap node has two required input types: remap and src. Additional optional types include src_mask and output_with_alpha."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the remap parameter?",
        "answer": " The remap parameter is used to specify the remapping operation to be applied to the image. It includes the function and parameters required for the transformation."

    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Remap Node?",
        "answer": "The Remap node produces two output types: image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Remap node work?",
        "answer": "The Remap node works by first converting the tensor input to an OpenCV image, then remapping using the specified remapping operation and interpolation method. It also applies a mask if provided."
