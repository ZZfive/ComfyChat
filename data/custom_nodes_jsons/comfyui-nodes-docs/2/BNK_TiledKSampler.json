        "question": "What is the purpose of the TiledKSampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TiledKSampler node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the generation of high-resolution images by dividing the task into smaller, more manageable parts called tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the TiledKSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial as it defines the underlying generative model used to generate image samples, acting as the core component that determines the type and quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter influence the image sampling process in TiledKSampler?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the image sampling process is reproducible and consistent across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'tiling_strategy' parameter play in the TiledKSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'tiling_strategy' parameter defines the method by which the image is divided into tiles, which can significantly alter the efficiency and quality of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter affect the image generation in TiledKSampler?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter determines the number of iterations for refining the image, with higher values leading to more detailed and smoother image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'positive' and 'negative' conditioning inputs in TiledKSampler?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' conditioning input guides the image generation towards desired features or characteristics, while the 'negative' conditioning input is used to exclude certain features or characteristics from the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' parameter represent in the TiledKSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter contains the initial latent representation of the image, which is iteratively refined through the sampling process to generate the final image."
