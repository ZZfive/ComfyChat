        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalPrompt node is designed to generate region-specific prompts using a mask to define the region of interest and an advanced sampler to determine points within that region. It plays a key role in focusing processing on specific areas of an image, enhancing the accuracy of subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RegionalPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RegionalPrompt node are 'mask' and 'advanced_sampler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter in the RegionalPrompt node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is crucial for defining the region of interest within the image. It acts as a filter, isolating the specific area that the node will process, significantly impacting the outcome of regional prompt generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'advanced_sampler' parameter in the RegionalPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'advanced_sampler' parameter is a key component that determines the sampling strategy within the defined region. It influences how points are selected within the mask, which is vital for the accuracy and representativeness of the regional prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RegionalPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RegionalPrompt node is 'REGIONAL_PROMPTS', which is a set of regional prompts customized to the input mask and sampler. These prompts are important for guiding further analysis or processing specific to the region of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the RegionalPrompt node use?",
        "answer": "The RegionalPrompt node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the RegionalPrompt node belong to?",
        "answer": "The RegionalPrompt node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Regional' category."
