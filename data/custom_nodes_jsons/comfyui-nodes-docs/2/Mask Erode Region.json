        "question": "What is the purpose of the erode_region method in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The erode_region method is designed to process input masks by applying an erosion effect, trimming the boundaries of the mask regions. This method is particularly useful in image processing tasks such as removing noise or isolating different areas within an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' input parameter represent in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter is essential for the erode_region method as it defines the image regions that will undergo erosion. This parameter directly impacts the execution and results of the node, determining which parts of the image will be affected by the erosion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iterations' parameter affect the erosion process in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter controls the degree of erosion applied to the input mask. Higher values result in more noticeable erosion, causing the size of the mask regions to decrease more significantly. This parameter is crucial for adjusting the intensity of the erosion to achieve the desired visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MASKS output parameter represent in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The MASKS output parameter represents the final mask after applying the erosion process. It is a critical output as it reflects the final state of the image regions after erosion, containing the information needed for further processing or analysis in subsequent workflow steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'iterations' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'iterations' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class is 5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the 'iterations' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'iterations' parameter is 1, and the maximum value is 64."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Erode_Region class is CPU."
