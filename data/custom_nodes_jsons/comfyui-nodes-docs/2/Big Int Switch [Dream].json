        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Int Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Big Int Switch node is designed to selectively output an integer value based on specified selection criteria. It facilitates dynamic decision-making in the data flow by allowing the selection of an integer from a predefined collection based on input conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'select' parameter in the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter specifies the index of the integer to be chosen. It plays a crucial role in determining which integer value the node outputs based on the implemented selection logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'on_missing' parameter handle missing integers in the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_missing' parameter defines the behavior of the node when the selected integer is missing. By specifying an alternative selection strategy, this parameter ensures that the node can handle the situation gracefully when the required integer is unavailable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_i' parameter represent in the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_i' parameter represents one of the potential integer values that can be selected. It is part of a series (input_0 to input_9) that collectively defines the set of integers the node can choose from based on the selection criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Big Int Switch node is 'selected', which represents the integer value chosen based on the input criteria. This output reflects the decision made by the node when selecting an integer from the available options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Big Int Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'pick' method in the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'pick' method is responsible for selecting the integer value based on the provided 'select', 'on_missing', and other input parameters. It implements the selection logic and returns the chosen integer value."
