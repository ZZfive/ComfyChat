        "question": "What is the main purpose of the PPFNLatentToCPU class?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of the PPFNLatentToCPU class is to promote the transfer of latent data to the CPU environment, ensuring that direct CPU-based calculations can be efficiently executed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'INPUT_TYPES' class method in PPFNLatentToCPU?",
        "answer": "The 'INPUT_TYPES' class method in PPFNLatentToCPU returns a dictionary {'latents': ('LATENT',)} which specifies the required input type, and the type of the 'latents' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'RETURN_TYPES' class attribute in PPFNLatentToCPU represent?",
        "answer": "The 'RETURN_TYPES' class attribute in PPFNLatentToCPU represents the type of the return value and is set to ('LATENT',). This indicates that the output of the 'latent_to_cpu' method is a latent variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents' output of the 'latent_to_cpu' method contain?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' output of the 'latent_to_cpu' method contains a dictionary with a single key-sample that holds the transferred latent tensor to the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for using the PPFNLatentToCPU class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the PPFNLatentToCPU class is the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'CATEGORY' class attribute in PPFNLatentToCPU?",
        "answer": "The 'CATEGORY' class attribute in PPFNLatentToCPU defines the category for the node, which in this case is 'Power Noise Suite/Latent/Util', indicating the type of function the node performs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'latents' argument in the 'latent_to_cpu' method?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' argument in the 'latent_to_cpu' method is vital as it stores the latent data that needs to be transferred to the CPU. Any operations that depend on CPU-based calculations will rely on this data."
