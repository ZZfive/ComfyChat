        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptWithSDXL node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptWithSDXL node in ComfyUI is designed to process and generate prompts for style and content generation tasks. It handles complex prompt structures and is optimized for generating high-quality outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PromptWithSDXL node are: positive_prompt, negative_prompt, positive_style, negative_style, and ratio_selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the positive_prompt input do in the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The positive_prompt input in the PromptWithSDXL node is a crucial input that guides the generation of content with desired characteristics. It plays a vital role in steering the output towards the intended style and theme."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the negative_prompt input in the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The negative_prompt input in the PromptWithSDXL node helps refine the generation process by specifying content to be avoided. It is important for ensuring the final output does not contain unwanted elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the PromptWithSDXL node are batch_size and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the batch_size input control in the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The batch_size input in the PromptWithSDXL node allows users to control the number of samples generated in a single operation. It can be adjusted based on the available computational resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the seed input in the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The seed input in the PromptWithSDXL node is used to introduce randomness in a controlled manner, which is useful for generating a diverse set of outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PromptWithSDXL node are: samples, positive_prompt_text_g, negative_prompt_text_g, positive_style_text_l, negative_style_text_l, width, height, refiner_width, and refiner_height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the samples output represent in the PromptWithSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The samples output in the PromptWithSDXL node contains the generated latent representations, which are central to the content generation process. These representations can be further refined to produce the final output."
