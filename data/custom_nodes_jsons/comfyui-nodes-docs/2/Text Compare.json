        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Compare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Compare node in ComfyUI is designed to compare two text inputs and determine their similarity or difference based on a specified mode. It operates by analyzing the text content and providing a score that reflects the degree of similarity or difference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Text_Compare node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Text_Compare node are 'text_a' and 'text_b', both of which are string inputs that need to be compared."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Text_Compare node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Text_Compare node specifies whether the comparison should focus on the similarity or the difference between the two text inputs. It influences the algorithm used for comparison and the type of results produced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'tolerance' parameter in the WAS_Text_Compare node?",
        "answer": "The 'tolerance' parameter in the WAS_Text_Compare node sets the threshold for determining the degree of similarity. It is particularly useful when the node is used to find texts that are almost identical."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_Text_Compare node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_Text_Compare node include 'TEXT_A_PASS', 'TEXT_B_PASS', 'BOOLEAN', 'SCORE_NUMBER', and 'COMPARISON_TEXT'. These outputs provide the compared text inputs, a boolean indicating if the texts are identical, a numerical score representing the degree of similarity or difference, and a textual representation of the comparison results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the WAS_Text_Compare node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the WAS_Text_Compare node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Text_Compare node calculate the similarity score between two texts?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Compare node calculates the similarity score between two texts by analyzing the text content and using algorithms to determine the degree of similarity. It then provides a score that reflects this similarity, taking into account the specified tolerance level and mode of comparison."
