        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec2ScalarOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec2ScalarOperation node is designed to perform various mathematical operations between a 2D vector (Vec2) and a scalar (float). It encapsulates the functionality of applying different vector-scalar operations that are crucial in computational geometry and linear algebra."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter specify in the Vec2ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec2ScalarOperation node specifies the type of mathematical operation to be performed between the vector and the scalar. It is essential for determining the nature of the calculation that the node will execute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the Vec2ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the 2D vector (Vec2) that will be used in the operation. As a fundamental input, it is crucial to the mathematical process and directly contributes to the final result of the computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'b' parameter in the Vec2ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter is the scalar value that will be used along with vector 'a' in the operation. Its importance lies in its role as a multiplier or operand in vector-scalar operations, influencing the final result of the computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the Vec2ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output is the transformed 2D vector (Vec2) after applying the specified operation. It represents the final result of the vector-scalar calculation, directly reflecting the input parameters and the chosen operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Vec2ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Vec2ScalarOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the Vec2ScalarOperation node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Vec2ScalarOperation node defines the input types, return types, function, and category of the node. It also includes the 'op' function that performs the specified vector-scalar operation using the input vector, scalar, and operation type."
