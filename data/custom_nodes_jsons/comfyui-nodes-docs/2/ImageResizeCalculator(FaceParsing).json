        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageResizeCalculator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageResizeCalculator node in ComfyUI is designed to intelligently resize images while maintaining their aspect ratios to meet specific requirements, such as target size and alignment to multiples of 8, which is crucial for certain image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageResizeCalculator node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), target_size (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and force_8x (Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN, Python dtype: bool)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'force_8x' parameter determine in the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'force_8x' parameter in the ImageResizeCalculator node determines whether the adjusted dimensions should be aligned to multiples of 8, which is particularly important for certain image processing algorithms that benefit from such alignment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageResizeCalculator node are: width (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), height (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), min (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), scale (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float), and scale_r (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min' output represent in the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'min' output in the ImageResizeCalculator node indicates the smaller of the two dimensions after resizing, providing insight into the aspect ratio of the resized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale_r' output represent in the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_r' output in the ImageResizeCalculator node represents the reciprocal of the scaling factor from the original height to the new height, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vertical resizing aspect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageResizeCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageResizeCalculator node is CPU."
