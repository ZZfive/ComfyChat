    {
        "question": "How are the cropping regions specified for the first and second revisions in the Revision Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The cropping regions for the first and second revisions in the Revision Settings (JPS) node are specified using the rev1_crop and rev2_crop parameters respectively, which define how the image is cropped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters control the offsets for the cropping in the first and second revisions in the Revision Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The rev1_offset and rev2_offset parameters control the offsets for the cropping in the first and second revisions respectively in the Revision Settings (JPS) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter specifies the interpolation method for cropping in the Revision Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The crop_intpol parameter in the Revision Settings (JPS) node specifies the interpolation method for cropping, affecting the quality and appearance of the cropped region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_res parameter define in the Revision Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The crop_res parameter in the Revision Settings (JPS) node defines the resolution for cropping, determining the size of the cropped area and affecting the detail and proportions of the final image."
