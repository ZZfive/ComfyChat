        "question": "What is the purpose of the InvSinWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvSinWave node in ComfyUI is designed to generate an inverted sine wave pattern. It achieves the desired output by manipulating the phase, amplitude, and translation of the wave, which is particularly useful in signal processing and waveform analysis applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the phase parameter control in the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter determines the period of the wave, affecting the number of times the wave completes a full cycle within a given timeframe. It is crucial for controlling the frequency of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the wave in the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude sets the height of the wave peaks, influencing the strength of the wave oscillations. It is an important parameter for adjusting the magnitude of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the x_translation parameter in the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The x_translation parameter moves the wave horizontally along the X-axis, allowing the positioning of the wave within a given space. It is significant for aligning the waveform with specific coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the y_translation parameter affect the wave in the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The y_translation parameter moves the wave vertically along the Y-axis, affecting the starting point of the wave oscillations. It is important for adjusting the vertical position of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the current_frame parameter specify in the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter specifies the current position in the time sequence, which is crucial for generating the wave at a specific moment in an animation or simulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the InvSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The InvSinWave node outputs two values: the 'output', which is the calculated value of the inverted sine wave under the specified parameters, and the 'int_output', which is the integer version of the wave's calculated value."
