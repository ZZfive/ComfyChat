        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskLikeImageSize node is used to generate a mask with the same dimensions as the input image. This is particularly useful for creating uniform masks that match the size of a given image, which is valuable in tasks such as image processing, segmentation, or compositing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskLikeImageSize node requires two inputs: an image tensor whose dimensions will determine the size of the generated mask, and a float value that will be used to fill the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the JWMaskLikeImageSize node determine the size of the output mask?",
        "answer": "The size of the output mask is determined by the dimensions of the input image tensor. This ensures that the mask matches the width and height of the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'value' input in the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input is a float that is used to fill the generated mask. By adjusting this value, users can customize the intensity or transparency of the mask to achieve different visual effects or meet specific processing requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node is a mask tensor that has the same size as the input image and is filled with the specified value. This mask can be directly used for various image processing tasks such as image blending, region selection, or applying effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the JWMaskLikeImageSize node use?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskLikeImageSize node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node define?",
        "answer": "The source code defines the class _@(register_node('JWImageLoadRGB', 'Image Load RGB')), which includes the category, input types, return types, and the execute function. The execute function takes a path to an image file, loads the image, and returns it."
