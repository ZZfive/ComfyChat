        "question": "What is the purpose of the SelectEveryNthImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SelectEveryNthImage node is designed to efficiently select and retrieve a subset of images from a larger collection. It operates by selecting every nth image as specified by the user, allowing for the creation of a condensed sequence that maintains the original order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SelectEveryNthImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SelectEveryNthImage node are 'images' and 'select_every_nth'. 'Images' is the collection of image data that the node will process, and 'select_every_nth' determines the frequency at which images are selected from the input collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select_every_nth' parameter in the SelectEveryNthImage node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'select_every_nth' parameter in the SelectEveryNthImage node determines the frequency at which images are selected from the input collection. It directly influences the number of images returned in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SelectEveryNthImage node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SelectEveryNthImage node are 'IMAGE' and 'count'. 'IMAGE' is the subset of images selected from the input collection, and 'count' provides the total number of images selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output in the SelectEveryNthImage node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output in the SelectEveryNthImage node provides the total number of images selected from the input collection. This information helps users understand the scope of the selection process and evaluate the output in the context of the original dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the SelectEveryNthImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the SelectEveryNthImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SelectEveryNthImage node's 'select_images' method work?",
        "answer": "The 'select_images' method of the SelectEveryNthImage node selects every nth image from the input collection based on the 'select_every_nth' parameter. It returns a tuple containing the selected images and the count of selected images."
