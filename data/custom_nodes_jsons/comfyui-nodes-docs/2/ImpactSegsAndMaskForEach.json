        "question": "What is the purpose of the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node in ComfyUI is used to perform a bitwise AND operation between each segmentation mask and a provided mask, generating a set of refined segmentation masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the bitwise AND operation in the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The bitwise AND operation in the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node is crucial for filtering out unwanted regions in the segmentation process, ensuring that only the regions of interest are retained."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node are 'segs' and 'masks'. 'segs' represents the collection of segmentation objects to be processed, and 'masks' is a tensor containing the masks to be applied to each segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'doit' method in the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'doit' method in the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node is a tuple containing the original segmentation and a list of refined segmentation objects, each with updated masks through the bitwise AND operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node in ComfyUI is 'ImpactPack/Operation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the SegsBitwiseAndMaskForEach node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
