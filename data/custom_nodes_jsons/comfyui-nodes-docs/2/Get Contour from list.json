        "question": "What is the purpose of the Get Contour from list node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Get Contour from list node in ComfyUI is designed to retrieve a specific contour from a list of contours based on a given index. It abstracts the process of accessing contours within a collection, facilitating the extraction of individual contour data for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Get Contour from list node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Get Contour from list node are 'contours' and 'index'. 'contours' represents the list of contours from which a specific contour is to be retrieved, and 'index' specifies the position of the contour to be retrieved from the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' input specify in the Get Contour from list node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' input in the Get Contour from list node specifies the position of the contour to be retrieved from the list. It determines the selection of the output contour, allowing for targeted extraction based on the order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Get Contour from list node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Get Contour from list node is 'cv_contour', which represents a single contour selected from the input list based on the specified index. It supports focused analysis or manipulation of specific contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified index is greater than or equal to the length of the contours list in the Get Contour from list node?",
        "answer": "If the specified index is greater than or equal to the length of the contours list in the Get Contour from list node, the node will return 'None' as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Get Contour from list node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Get Contour from list node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Get Contour from list node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Get Contour from list node in ComfyUI is 'Bmad/CV/Contour'."
