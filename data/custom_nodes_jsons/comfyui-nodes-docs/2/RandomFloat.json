        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomFloat node is used to generate a random floating point number within a specified range in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RandomFloat node are 'min' and 'max', both of which are of Comfy dtype FLOAT and Python dtype float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min' input specify in the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'min' input in the RandomFloat node specifies the minimum value of the range for generating the random floating point number, ensuring the output is not less than this value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max' input define in the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'max' input in the RandomFloat node defines the maximum value of the range for generating the random floating point number, guaranteeing the generated number will not exceed this value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the RandomFloat node are 'float' (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float) and 'string' (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'float' output represent in the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'float' output in the RandomFloat node represents the generated random floating point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'string' output represent in the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'string' output in the RandomFloat node represents the string representation of the generated random floating point number."
