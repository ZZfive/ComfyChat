        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node is designed to process and encode positive and negative image pairs for contrastive learning. It utilizes the CLIP model to extract visual features and align them with text descriptions to create meaningful image-text associations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node are 'width', 'height', 'positive_g', and 'negative_g'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter specify in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter is a key parameter that defines the horizontal resolution of the input image. It is crucial for the node to correctly process and resize images, thereby ensuring that encoding features are extracted from the correct dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'positive_g' parameter in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_g' parameter is associated with the text description of a positive image. It is crucial for the node to create semantic connections between image content and text, which is important for the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'negative_g' parameter represent in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_g' parameter represents the text description of a negative image. This parameter is important because it provides the necessary contrast to the positive image, enhancing the node's ability to distinguish and learn from two different image-text pairs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node are 'positive' and 'negative', both of which are of the 'CONDITIONING' comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive' output contain in the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' output contains the encoded features and metadata of the positive image. It is a key part of the node's output as it represents one aspect of the contrastive learning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the WLSH_CLIP_Positive_Negative_XL node is GPU."
