        "question": "What is the purpose of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images using the DSINE model to generate normal maps. It optimizes the model's performance by adjusting the field of view and iteration parameters to generate detailed normal maps from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is an image, which serves as the target for generating the normal map. The image is processed by the model to generate the normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fov' parameter do in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'fov' parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node adjusts the field of view for generating the normal map, affecting the perception of depth and detail in the resulting image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iterations' parameter affect the output of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node controls the number of optimization steps performed by the model, influencing the accuracy and level of detail in the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is an image, specifically a normal map image that visually represents surface normals using colors, providing detailed information about the surface geometry of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is required for the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node requires a GPU as the infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution' parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node specifies the output resolution of the generated normal map, affecting the level of detail and clarity."
