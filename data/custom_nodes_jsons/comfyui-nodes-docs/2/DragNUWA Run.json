    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial as it defines the underlying architecture and pre-trained weights used for the image processing task. It determines the node's ability to interpret and transform the input image based on learned patterns and features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tracking_points' parameter do in the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'tracking_points' parameter provides spatial information necessary for the model to understand and predict motion in the image sequence. It guides the transformation and enhancement process to ensure the output is consistent with the desired motion dynamics."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'inference_batch_size' parameter affect the performance of the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'inference_batch_size' parameter optimizes the node's processing efficiency by determining how many images are processed simultaneously. It influences the trade-off between computational resources and processing speed, thus affecting the overall performance of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'motion_bucket_id' parameter play in the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'motion_bucket_id' parameter classifies the type of motion for the model to apply specific transformations. It helps achieve the desired motion effect in the output by selecting the appropriate motion profile from a predefined collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_optical_flow' parameter contribute to the functionality of the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_optical_flow' parameter enables or disables the application of optical flow techniques for motion estimation. It is crucial for the node to accurately predict and simulate complex motion in the image sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'directory' parameter in the DragNUWARun node?",
        "answer": "The 'directory' parameter specifies the location for storing or retrieving optical flow data. It is essential for the node to access the necessary motion information, which is critical for accurately executing the image processing task."
