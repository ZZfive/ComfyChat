        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatAdd node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatAdd node in ComfyUI is used to perform addition of two floating-point numbers, providing a simple and basic arithmetic operation function for numerical calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWFloatAdd node?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatAdd node requires two input types: 'a' and 'b', both of which are floating-point numbers. 'a' represents the first floating-point number to be added, and 'b' represents the second floating-point number to be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWFloatAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWFloatAdd node is a floating-point number, which is the result of adding the two input floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is JWFloatAdd an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWFloatAdd node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWFloatAdd node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWFloatAdd node is 'CPU'."
