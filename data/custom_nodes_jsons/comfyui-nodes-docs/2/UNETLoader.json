    {
        "question": "What does the `load_unet` method do?",
        "answer": "The `load_unet` method is used to retrieve and load a pre-trained U-Net model from a specified directory. It is a crucial component in the model deployment process, ensuring the correct model is loaded and prepared for inference tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `unet_name` parameter?",
        "answer": "The `unet_name` parameter is required to identify the specific U-Net model to be loaded. It guides the loader to the correct file path, enabling the retrieval of the required model for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the `load_unet` method be used with other types of models?",
        "answer": "The `load_unet` method is specifically designed for loading pre-trained U-Net models. It is not applicable for loading other types of models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the `load_unet` method?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `load_unet` method is `MODEL`, which represents a PyTorch module. This module is a pre-trained U-Net model that can be used for various image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dependencies does the `load_unet` method require?",
        "answer": "The `load_unet` method requires the Torch library to be imported, as indicated by the line `import torchsummary as ts`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `unet_name` parameter used in the `load_unet` method?",
        "answer": "The `unet_name` parameter is used to dynamically retrieve the file path of the U-Net model. It is combined with the `folder_paths.get_full_path('unet', '')` function to get the full path of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `restore_from` method used for?",
        "answer": "The `restore_from` method is used to convert a string representation of a tensor, such as one saved using the `torch.save.gen_tensor` method, back into a PyTorch tensor."
