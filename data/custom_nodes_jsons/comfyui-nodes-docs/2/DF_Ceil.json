        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Ceil node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node in ComfyUI implements the mathematical ceiling function, which rounds a given floating-point number up to the nearest integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node requires a 'Value' input, which specifies the floating-point number to be rounded up. This input is essential for determining the node's output result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the 'Value' input in the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the 'Value' input in the DF_Ceil node is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the corresponding Python data type for the 'Value' input in the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The corresponding Python data type for the 'Value' input in the DF_Ceil node is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the DF_Ceil node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the DF_Ceil node represents the integer result after rounding up the input floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the output of the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the output of the DF_Ceil node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the corresponding Python data type for the output of the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The corresponding Python data type for the output of the DF_Ceil node is int."
