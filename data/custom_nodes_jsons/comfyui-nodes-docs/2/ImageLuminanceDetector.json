        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI is designed to analyze and adjust the brightness of an image based on gamma correction. It uses the Recolorizer from the controlnet_aux library to modify the image brightness in order to improve image quality or achieve specific visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ImageLuminanceDetector node is the 'image' parameter, which is the input image that needs to have its brightness adjusted. The Comfy dtype for this input is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gamma_correction' parameter do in the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'gamma_correction' parameter in the ImageLuminanceDetector node specifies the gamma correction factor used to adjust the image brightness. Higher values make the image brighter, while lower values make it darker, affecting the overall visual output. It is an optional parameter with a Comfy dtype of FLOAT and a Python dtype of float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution' parameter in the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the ImageLuminanceDetector node determines the resolution to which the image is resized before applying the brightness adjustment. It affects the level of detail in the output. It is an optional parameter with a Comfy dtype of INT and a Python dtype of int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageLuminanceDetector node is the modified image after the brightness adjustment has been applied, based on the applied gamma correction to enhance or change the visual appearance. The output has a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImageLuminanceDetector node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImageLuminanceDetector node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category in ComfyUI."
