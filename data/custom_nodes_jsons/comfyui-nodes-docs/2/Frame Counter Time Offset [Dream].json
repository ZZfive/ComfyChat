        "question": "What is the purpose of the Frame Counter Time Offset node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset node in ComfyUI is used to apply a time-based offset to the frame counter, effectively adjusting the current frame based on the specified number of seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Frame Counter Time Offset node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Counter Time Offset node are: frame_counter (Comfy dtype: FRAME_COUNTER, Python dtype: FrameCounter) and offset_seconds (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Frame Counter Time Offset node calculate the equivalent frame count for the time offset?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset node calculates the equivalent frame count for the time offset by multiplying the offset_seconds value with the frame rate, determining the number of frames to adjust."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Frame Counter Time Offset node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Frame Counter Time Offset node is frame_counter (Comfy dtype: FRAME_COUNTER, Python dtype: FrameCounter), which represents the adjusted frame counter after applying the time offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Frame Counter Time Offset node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Frame Counter Time Offset node is CPU."
