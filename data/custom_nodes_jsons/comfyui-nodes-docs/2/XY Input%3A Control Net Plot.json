        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: Control Net Plot node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Control Net Plot node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a series of values within a specified range based on Control Net parameters for plotting. It dynamically adjusts input parameters such as strength, start percentage, and end percentage to create a dataset suitable for XY plotting, making it easier to visualize how changes in these parameters affect the output of the Control Net."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the XY Input: Control Net Plot node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the XY Input: Control Net Plot node include control_net, image, plot_type, strength, start_percent, end_percent, X_batch_count, X_first_value, X_last_value, Y_batch_count, Y_first_value, and Y_last_value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'plot_type' parameter specify in the XY Input: Control Net Plot node?",
        "answer": "The 'plot_type' parameter in the XY Input: Control Net Plot node specifies the type of chart to be generated, indicating how the X and Y values are derived and relate to each other."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'X_batch_count' parameter affect the chart generated by the XY Input: Control Net Plot node?",
        "answer": "The 'X_batch_count' parameter in the XY Input: Control Net Plot node specifies the number of data points generated for the X-axis of the chart, affecting its granularity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'cnet_stack' parameter in the XY Input: Control Net Plot node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'cnet_stack' parameter in the XY Input: Control Net Plot node is an additional stack of parameters that can be appended to each data point, allowing for the creation of more complex or detailed charts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the XY Input: Control Net Plot node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the XY Input: Control Net Plot node are X and Y, representing the X and Y values generated based on the specified input parameters and adjusted for the chart."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the XY Input: Control Net Plot node handle the generation of intermediate values for the X and Y axes?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Control Net Plot node generates intermediate values for the X and Y axes by calculating increments based on the first value, last value, and batch count. It adds these intermediate values to the dataset only if the batch count is more than 2."
