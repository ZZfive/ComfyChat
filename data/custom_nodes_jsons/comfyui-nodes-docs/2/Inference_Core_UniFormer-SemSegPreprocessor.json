        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It utilizes the UniFormer model to process images and generate semantic segmentation maps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is an image that needs to be semantically segmented. This parameter is crucial for determining the content and structure of the output segmentation map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is the resolution, which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing. This affects the fineness and quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is the semantic segmentation map of the input image, represented as a tensor."
    },
