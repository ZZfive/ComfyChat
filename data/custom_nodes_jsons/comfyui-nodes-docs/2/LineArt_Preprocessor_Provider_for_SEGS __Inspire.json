        "question": "What is the effect of enabling the 'coarse' option in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'coarse' option in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node produces more robust and prominent lines, while disabling it generates more refined and detailed line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'coarse' input in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'coarse' input in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node is BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'coarse' input in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'coarse' input in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node is bool."

    {
        "question": "What does the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node return?",
        "answer": "The LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node returns an object that can preprocess an image into line art suitable for the SEGS model, helping to create stylized images or animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the returned object from the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the returned object from the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node is SEGS_PREPROCESSOR."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the returned object from the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the returned object from the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS Inspire node is LineArt_Preprocessor_wrapper."
