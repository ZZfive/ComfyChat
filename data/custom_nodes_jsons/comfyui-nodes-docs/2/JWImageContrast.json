        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageContrast node is used to adjust the contrast of an image in ComfyUI. It allows enhancing or weakening the difference between light and dark areas in the image by specifying a factor parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The JWImageContrast node requires two input types: 'image' (the input image whose contrast needs to be adjusted) and 'factor' (a multiplier used to adjust the contrast, with values greater than 1 increasing contrast and less than 1 decreasing it)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageContrast node is 'image', which represents the image after the contrast adjustment has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the JWImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the JWImageContrast node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the valid blend types for the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The valid blend types for the JWImageMix node are 'mix' and 'multiply'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'factor' parameter in the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'factor' parameter in the JWImageMix node is 0.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'factor' parameter in the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter in the JWImageMix node is used to control the blending of two input images. It determines the proportion of each image in the resulting mixed image."
