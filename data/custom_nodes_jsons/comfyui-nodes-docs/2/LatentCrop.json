        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentCrop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentCrop node in ComfyUI is designed to manipulate and extract specific regions from a larger latent space representation, playing a key role in focusing the data's attention on relevant areas for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LatentCrop node are 'samples', 'width', 'height', 'x', and 'y'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' parameter represent in the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter represents the latent space data to be cropped, which is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the source material for the cropping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'width' and 'height' parameters affect the output of the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' and 'height' parameters specify the required width and height of the cropped region in the latent space, directly influencing the range of data extracted and the dimensions of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do the 'x' and 'y' parameters play in the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' and 'y' parameters set the horizontal and vertical starting points of the cropping operation within the latent space, working together to precisely determine the coordinates where the cropping begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentCrop node is 'cropped_samples', which contains the result of the cropping operation on the latent space data, representing a refined portion of the original data adjusted according to the specified dimensions and position parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the LatentCrop node is CPU."
