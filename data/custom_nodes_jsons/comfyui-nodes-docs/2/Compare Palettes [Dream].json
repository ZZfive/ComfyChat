        "question": "What is the purpose of the Compare Palettes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes node in ComfyUI is used to compare two RGB color palettes by calculating the average multipliers of brightness, contrast, and RGB color intensity differences between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Compare Palettes node?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes node requires two input types: 'a' and 'b', both of which are RGB color palettes. 'a' serves as the baseline palette for comparison, while 'b' is the second palette to be compared against 'a'."
