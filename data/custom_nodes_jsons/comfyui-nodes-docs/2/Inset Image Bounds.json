        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the boundaries of an image by applying inset values, ensuring the modified image maintains its structural integrity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the image_bounds parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The image_bounds parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node defines the initial boundaries of the image to which the inset values will be applied. It is crucial for determining the starting point of the image dimension modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inset_left parameter specify in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The inset_left parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node specifies the amount by which the left boundary of the image should be inset. It plays a significant role in establishing the new left edge of the image after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the inset_right parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The inset_right parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node stipulates the amount by which the right boundary of the image should be inset. It is vital for setting up the new right edge of the adjusted image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inset_top parameter indicate in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The inset_top parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node indicates the amount by which the top boundary of the image should be inset. It is essential in setting the new top edge of the image after applying the inset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the inset_bottom parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The inset_bottom parameter in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node determines the amount by which the bottom boundary of the image should be inset. It is crucial for defining the new bottom edge of the adjusted image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the inset_bounds output represent in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The inset_bounds output in the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node represents the new boundaries of the image after applying the insets. It is important as it reflects the final dimensions of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node run?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Inset_Image_Bounds node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
