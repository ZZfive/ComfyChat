        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlurNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BlurNode class in ComfyUI is designed to apply a Gaussian blur effect to images, simulating the soft focus effect commonly used in photography and image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the image parameter in the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The image parameter in the BlurNode class is the input image that the node will process. It is crucial because it serves as the primary data for the node's operation to achieve the blur effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the radius parameter influence the blur effect in the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The radius parameter in the BlurNode class defines the range of the blur effect. It is essential because it directly affects the size of the Gaussian kernel used for blurring, thereby influencing the degree of blurring applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the sigma_factor parameter play in the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The sigma_factor parameter in the BlurNode class adjusts the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, allowing control over the smoothness of the blur. It plays a key role in fine-tuning the blur effect to meet specific visual requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blurred_image output parameter represent in the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The blurred_image output parameter in the BlurNode class represents the processed image with the Gaussian blur effect applied. It is the result of the node's operation and reflects the modified visual appearance of the input image after blurring."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The BlurNode class recommends using the GPU as the infrastructure type for optimal performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the gaussian_blur function in the BlurNode class?",
        "answer": "The gaussian_blur function in the BlurNode class applies the Gaussian blur effect to the input image using a Gaussian kernel. It calculates the kernel based on the specified kernel size and sigma value, and then convolves the image with the kernel to achieve the desired blur effect."
