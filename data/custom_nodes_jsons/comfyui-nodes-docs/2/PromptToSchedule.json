        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptToSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptToSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to parse text prompts and convert them into a structured schedule format, which is essential for managing and organizing prompts into a coherent schedule that can be further processed or executed within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by the 'parse' method of the PromptToSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the 'parse' method of the PromptToSchedule node is the 'text' parameter, which represents the raw text input that needs to be parsed into a structured schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'settings' parameter in the 'parse' method?",
        "answer": "The 'settings' parameter in the 'parse' method is an optional configuration provided to customize the parsing behavior, allowing for fine-tuning of the parsing process according to specific requirements or constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'parse' method?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'parse' method is 'PROMPT_SCHEDULE', which is a structured representation of the input text. This output is crucial as it lays the foundation for any subsequent operations or analyses that depend on the parsed schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the PromptToSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the PromptToSchedule node is CPU."

    {
        "question": "How is the source code of the PromptToSchedule class structured?",
        "answer": "The source code of the PromptToSchedule class includes the definition of input and return types, category, function, and the main 'parse' method which processes the input text and returns the structured schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'parse_prompt_schedules' function do within the 'parse' method?",
        "answer": "Within the 'parse' method, the 'parse_prompt_schedules' function is responsible for parsing the input text into schedules, which are then returned as the structured schedule output."
