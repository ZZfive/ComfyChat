        "question": "What is the purpose of CR_CycleTextSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR_CycleTextSimple is a node designed to sequentially loop through a list of text strings. It can handle multiple text inputs and cycle them based on specified frame intervals and loop counts, making it suitable for creating dynamic text animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for CR_CycleTextSimple?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for CR_CycleTextSimple are mode, frame_interval, loops, and current_frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in CR_CycleTextSimple define?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in CR_CycleTextSimple determines the order in which the text strings are cycled. It is crucial for defining the sequence and pattern of the text animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_interval' parameter affect the text animation in CR_CycleTextSimple?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' parameter in CR_CycleTextSimple determines the rate at which the text strings are cycled, thereby influencing the speed of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'text_list_simple' parameter in CR_CycleTextSimple?",
        "answer": "The 'text_list_simple' parameter is an optional input in CR_CycleTextSimple that simplifies the process of entering multiple text strings, thus simplifying the addition of text content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does CR_CycleTextSimple produce?",
        "answer": "CR_CycleTextSimple produces two outputs: 'current_text_item' which represents the currently displayed text string as part of the text loop animation, and 'show_help' which provides a URL link to documentation for further help and information on node usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does CR_CycleTextSimple use?",
        "answer": "CR_CycleTextSimple uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
