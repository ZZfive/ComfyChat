        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_LatentInputSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_LatentInputSwitch node is designed to manage the selection between two latent states based on an input value, acting as a decision component in a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Input' parameter in the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter is crucial as it determines which latent state the node will select. It is an integer with a range between 1 and 2, where 1 corresponds to the first latent state and 2 to the second."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent1' parameter represent in the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent1' parameter represents the first latent state that the node can choose. It becomes significant when the 'Input' parameter is set to 1, in which case 'latent1' is the output the node will return."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent2' parameter represent in the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent2' parameter represents the second latent state that can be chosen. It is considered when the 'Input' parameter is set to 2, resulting in 'latent2' being the output the node returns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main output of the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The main output of the CR_LatentInputSwitch node is 'LATENT', which represents the latent state selected based on the 'Input' parameter. It carries the latent data conditionally chosen from 'latent1' or 'latent2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation page for further assistance. It is included as a secondary output to guide users in seeking more information about the node's usage and functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CR_LatentInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CR_LatentInputSwitch node is CPU."
