        "question": "What is the purpose of the Switch string [Crystools] node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Switch string [Crystools] node in ComfyUI provides a mechanism to switch between two string values based on a boolean condition. It abstracts the conditional logic into a simple interface, making the code more concise and readable when handling binary decisions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Switch string [Crystools] node are: 'on_true' (STRING), 'on_false' (STRING), and 'boolean' (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'on_true' input represent in the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_true' input in the Switch string [Crystools] node represents the string value that will be returned if the boolean condition evaluates to True. It plays a key role in determining the output result based on the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'on_false' input represent in the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The 'on_false' input in the Switch string [Crystools] node represents the string value that will be returned if the boolean condition evaluates to False. It serves as the alternative output, ensuring that a value is returned regardless of the condition's outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boolean' input represent in the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' input in the Switch string [Crystools] node represents the boolean condition that determines which string value ('on_true' or 'on_false') will be returned. It is the key factor in the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Switch string [Crystools] node is STRING. It returns one of the two input strings based on the evaluation of the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Switch string [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Switch string [Crystools] node is CPU."
