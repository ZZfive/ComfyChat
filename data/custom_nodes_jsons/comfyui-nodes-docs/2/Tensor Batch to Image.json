        "question": "What is the purpose of the `tensor_batch_to_image` method in the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class?",
        "answer": "The `tensor_batch_to_image` method is designed to convert a batch of tensor images into a single image representation. It is a crucial step in the image processing pipeline, allowing batch data to be transformed into a format that can be more easily used or displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `images_batch` parameter in the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class?",
        "answer": "The `images_batch` parameter is critical because it contains the batch of tensor images to be converted into a single image. It plays a core role in the operation of the node, determining the source data for the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `batch_image_number` parameter in the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class specify?",
        "answer": "The `batch_image_number` parameter determines which image from the batch is selected for conversion. Its value affects the execution of the node by specifying the index of the desired image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class is 'image', which is the result of the conversion process and represents the selected image from the batch. It is important as it is the direct output of the node's functionality, containing the transformed data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the `batch_image_number` parameter in the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the `batch_image_number` parameter in the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class is 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class return if the specified `batch_image_number` is not defined?",
        "answer": "If the specified `batch_image_number` is not defined, the WAS_Tensor_Batch_to_Image class returns the last image in the batch and prints an error message indicating that the specified batch number is not defined."
