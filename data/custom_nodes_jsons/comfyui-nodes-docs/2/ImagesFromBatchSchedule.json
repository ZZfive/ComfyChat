        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImagesFromBatchSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a series of images based on provided text prompts and the current frame within a specified maximum frame range. It processes the input text to create a series of prompts and selects appropriate images for each frame, ensuring smooth transitions between frames in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node are 'images', which is the collection of image data that the node uses to generate the animation, and 'text', which contains descriptive text that the node uses to interpret and generate the animation prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_frame' parameter in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node specifies the frame that the node is currently processing. It is important because it determines the starting point for selecting images for the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'max_frames' parameter affect the operation of the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' parameter sets the upper limit for the number of frames in the animation. It is important because it restricts the range within which the node operates to generate the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'print_output' parameter in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_output' parameter is a flag that, when set to True, instructs the node to print the output to the console. This is useful for debugging purposes as it allows viewing intermediate results of the animation generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node is 'selected_images', which contains the images selected for the current frame of the animation. This output is important as it represents the visual result of the node's operation for a given frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node use?",
        "answer": "The ImagesFromBatchSchedule node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
