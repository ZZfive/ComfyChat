        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateQRCodeNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateQRCodeNode class is designed to generate QR codes from text input in ComfyUI. It encapsulates the functionality of converting a string into a QR code image, following specified size, version, error correction level, box size, and border parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'text' parameter in the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is crucial as it is the source of information to be encoded into the QR code. It can be a multiline string, allowing for more complex data to be included."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the QR code generated by the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter determines the dimensions of the QR code image. It is important as it influences the scale and readability of the QR code, with a default value set to ensure a balance between size and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'qr_version' parameter control in the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'qr_version' parameter controls the version of the QR code, which corresponds to its error correction capability and data storage capacity. It is essential for ensuring the QR code can handle the amount of data provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'error_correction' parameter in the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'error_correction' parameter sets the error correction level of the QR code. It is crucial as it defines the resilience of the QR code to damage and its readability at different distances."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'box_size' parameter influence the QR code created by the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'box_size' parameter specifies the size of each box in the QR grid. It is important as it affects the visual appearance of the QR code and the precision required to scan the QR code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'border' parameter in the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'border' parameter sets the width of the border around the QR code. It is important as it provides a clear boundary between the QR code and its surrounding area, enhancing its scannability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CreateQRCodeNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CreateQRCodeNode is 'IMAGE', which is the resulting QR code image generated based on the input parameters. It is important as it is the primary deliverable of the node, representing the encoded information in a visual format."
