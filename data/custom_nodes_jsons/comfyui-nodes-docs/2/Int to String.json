        "question": "What is the purpose of the INTtoSTRING node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The INTtoSTRING node in ComfyUI is designed to convert integer values to their string representations. It provides the ability to format strings with or without commas to accommodate different use cases, offering a versatile method for displaying numerical data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'int_' parameter in the INTtoSTRING node?",
        "answer": "The 'int_' parameter is the integer that needs to be converted to a string. It plays a key role in the operation of the node, as it is the primary input for the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'use_commas' parameter in the INTtoSTRING node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_commas' parameter determines whether the output string should include commas as thousands separators. It affects the readability of the numeric data in string format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the INTtoSTRING node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the INTtoSTRING node is a string, which represents the string representation of the input integer. It directly reflects the conversion result of the node's primary function."
