    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node are 'text', 'clip', and 'parser'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' parameter represent in the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is crucial as it provides the raw text data that the node processes. It lays the foundation for the entire encoding operation, and its content directly affects the quality and relevance of the generated embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' parameter represent in the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter represents the CLIP model that the node uses to encode the text. It is a key element because the model's capabilities and training directly influence the encoding process and the subsequent use of the embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'parser' parameter do in the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The 'parser' parameter is essential for determining how the text will be interpreted and processed by the node. It affects the granularity and structure of the text representation, which is crucial for the accuracy and effectiveness of the encoding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node is 'CONDITIONING', which is a set of conditioning data derived from the encoded text. This data is critical as it can be used to guide and refine subsequent AI models or tasks, providing them with the necessary context and structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the smZ_CLIPTextEncode node is GPU."
