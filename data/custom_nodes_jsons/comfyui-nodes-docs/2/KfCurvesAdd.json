        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurvesAdd node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesAdd node is designed to merge two keyframed curves into a single composite curve, playing a crucial role in workflows where combining curves is essential for creating complex animations or data representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfCurvesAdd node?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesAdd node requires two input types: curve_1 and curve_2, both of which are keyframed curves that are critical for forming the final composite curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurvesAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfCurvesAdd node is a keyframed curve, representing the sum of the two input curves, which is important for providing a single, coherent curve for further use in animation or data visualization processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' specified for the KfCurvesAdd node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' specified for the KfCurvesAdd node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfCurvesAdd node combine the two input curves?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesAdd node combines the two input curves by adding them together, as seen in the line 'return (curve_1 + curve_2,)' in the source code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the line 'curve_1 = deepcopy(curve_1)' in the source code indicate?",
        "answer": "The line 'curve_1 = deepcopy(curve_1)' in the source code indicates that a deep copy of curve_1 is created, ensuring that the original input curve is not modified during the operation of the KfCurvesAdd node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the KfCurvesAdd node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the KfCurvesAdd node is not an output node."
