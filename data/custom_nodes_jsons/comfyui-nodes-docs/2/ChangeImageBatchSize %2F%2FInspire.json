        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChangeImageBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChangeImageBatchSize node is designed to adjust the batch size of a given set of images, ensuring the output meets specified batch size requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChangeImageBatchSize node adjust the batch size of images?",
        "answer": "The ChangeImageBatchSize node adjusts the batch size by either duplicating the last image to fill the batch or truncating the batch as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ChangeImageBatchSize node are the 'image' parameter, which is a batch of images to be resized, and the 'batch_size' parameter, which specifies the desired number of images in the output batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the ChangeImageBatchSize node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines the method used to adjust the batch size. In this case, 'simple' mode is the only supported option, outlining the process of meeting batch size requirements by duplicating the last image or truncating the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ChangeImageBatchSize node is 'image', which is the result of the batch size adjustment process and contains the adjusted set of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ChangeImageBatchSize node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChangeImageBatchSize node handle cases where the input batch size is smaller than the specified batch size?",
        "answer": "If the input batch size is smaller than the specified batch size, the ChangeImageBatchSize node duplicates the last image to fill the batch and meet the batch size requirement."
