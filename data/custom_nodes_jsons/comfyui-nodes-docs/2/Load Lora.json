        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Loader node is used to manage the loading and application of Lora models within the WAS suite. It ensures efficient processing of Lora files by caching previously loaded models, reducing redundancy, and improving performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WAS_Lora_Loader node do with the model parameter?",
        "answer": "The model parameter represents the main object of the Lora enhancement that the node will apply. It is crucial for the node's operation and the resulting model's capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the clip parameter in the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The clip parameter defines the context in which the Lora model operates. It affects how the model integrates with the rest of the system, impacting the final outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the lora_name parameter specify in the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The lora_name parameter identifies the Lora model to be loaded. It is a critical decision-making factor in customization, determining which Lora model's features will be utilized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Lora_Loader node strengthen the impact of the Lora model?",
        "answer": "The strength_model parameter adjusts the intensity of the Lora model's influence on the base model. It is a key factor in tuning the performance of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the strength_clip parameter control in the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The strength_clip parameter regulates the influence of the CLIP model throughout the process. It plays a significant role in forming the final output according to the desired specifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the strength_model and strength_clip parameters are set to 0 in the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "When both strength_model and strength_clip are set to 0, the original model and CLIP are returned without any modifications from the Lora model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the NAME_STRING output of the WAS_Lora_Loader node provide?",
        "answer": "The NAME_STRING output of the WAS_Lora_Loader node provides the name of the loaded Lora model, which is crucial for tracking and referencing within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of infrastructure are supported by the WAS_Lora_Loader node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Loader node is compatible with CPU infrastructure."
