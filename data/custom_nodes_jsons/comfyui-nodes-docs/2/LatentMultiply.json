        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentMultiply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentMultiply node in ComfyUI is designed to perform multiplication operations on latent space samples. It takes a set of latent samples and a multiplier value, then applies the multiplication to each sample in the set, scaling the latent space representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'samples' parameter in the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter represents a set of latent vectors to be multiplied by a given factor. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it determines the data on which the multiplication operation will be performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'multiplier' parameter play in the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter is a floating-point number used to scale the latent samples. It plays an important role in the node's functionality as it directly affects the size of the latent vectors obtained after the multiplication operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentMultiply node is 'samples_out', which contains the latent samples that have been multiplied by the specified multiplier. This output is important as it represents the transformed latent space that can be used for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for running the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the LatentMultiply node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the LatentMultiply node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentMultiply node belongs to the 'latent/advanced' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'multiplier' parameter in the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'multiplier' parameter in the LatentMultiply node is 1.0."
