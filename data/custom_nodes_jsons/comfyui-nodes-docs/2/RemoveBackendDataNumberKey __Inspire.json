        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is designed to remove specific data entries from the backend cache based on a numeric key, allowing for selective clearing of cached data to enhance data management and optimization in the backend infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is 'key', which is an integer (INT) that specifies the numeric key associated with the data to be removed from the cache."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is 'signal_opt', which allows an optional signal to be passed through the node and returned, enabling additional control flow or data passing without affecting the cache operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node is 'signal', which returns the optional signal passed to the node, facilitating operation linking or control data passing through the node workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node use?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified key is not found in the cache?",
        "answer": "If the specified key is not found in the cache, the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey node will print a message indicating that the data key is invalid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'doit' static method in the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey class do?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' static method in the RemoveBackendDataNumberKey class checks if the specified key exists in the cache and deletes the corresponding cache entry if found. If the key is not found, it prints a message indicating an invalid data key. Finally, it returns the optional signal passed to the node."
