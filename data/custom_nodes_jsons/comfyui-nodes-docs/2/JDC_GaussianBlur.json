        "question": "What is the purpose of the GaussianBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GaussianBlur node in ComfyUI is used to apply a Gaussian blur effect to an image, which is often used to reduce noise or create a softening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node controls the extent of the blurring effect. A larger radius results in a more noticeable blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the GaussianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GaussianBlur node are IMAGE, which is the main input for the Gaussian blur operation, and blur_radius, which controls the extent of the blurring effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GaussianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GaussianBlur node is IMAGE, which represents the result of applying the Gaussian blur to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the blur_radius parameter in the GaussianBlur node is 1, and the maximum value is 1024."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the GaussianBlur node use?",
        "answer": "The GaussianBlur node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
