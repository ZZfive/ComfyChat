        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec3ScalarOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec3ScalarOperation node is designed to perform various scalar operations on three-dimensional vectors. It does this by applying the specified operation to each element of the vector with a given scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter define in the Vec3ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter defines the specific scalar operation to be performed on the vector. It is crucial because it determines the type of mathematical operation that will be executed on the components of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the Vec3ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the three-dimensional vector on which the operation will be applied. As the core input, it is essential for the node's functionality, and the node's output depends on the values within this vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'b' parameter in the Vec3ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter is the scalar value that interacts with vector 'a' during the operation. Its role is crucial because it is the numerical value that will be used together with each element of the vector for the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the Vec3ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output is the three-dimensional vector that has undergone the specified scalar operation. It contains the result of the node's calculations, reflecting the changes made to the original vector 'a' through the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec3ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec3ScalarOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the Vec3ScalarOperation node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The Vec3ScalarOperation node is implemented through a class that defines input types, return types, function, and category. The operation is performed using the 'op' function, which takes the 'op', 'a', and 'b' parameters as inputs and returns a tuple containing the resulting vector."
