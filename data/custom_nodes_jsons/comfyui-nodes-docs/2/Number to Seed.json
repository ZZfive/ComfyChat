        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_To_Seed node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a number to a seed format. It is a fundamental tool within the WAS suite, facilitating operations that require seed-based methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'number' parameter in the WAS_Number_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' parameter is crucial for the operation of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node as it is the input value that the node will convert into a seed. It plays a key role in determining the characteristics of the output seed, which can significantly affect subsequent processes in the WAS suite that utilize this seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is accepted for the 'number' parameter in the WAS_Number_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' parameter in the WAS_Number_To_Seed node accepts data of the type NUMBER in ComfyUI, which corresponds to Union[int, float] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node is a 'seed', which represents the seed converted from the input number. This seed is essential for initiating processes within the WAS suite that require a seed to execute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the output 'seed' of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The output 'seed' of the WAS_Number_To_Seed node is of the SEED type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to Dict[str, Union[int, float]] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Number_To_Seed node run on?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_To_Seed node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the WAS_Number_To_Seed node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_To_Seed node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Number/Operations' category in ComfyUI."
