        "question": "What is the purpose of the Morphology node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Morphology node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various morphological operations on images, such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing, which are basic operations in image processing used to change the shape or size of features in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' input parameter in the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter is the main data on which the morphological operation will be applied. It is a crucial parameter because the entire functionality of the node revolves around manipulating this image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'operation' parameter influence the Morphology node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' parameter specifies the type of morphological transformation to be performed. It is very important as it determines the nature of the changes that will be made to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'kernel_size' parameter play in the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_size' parameter determines the size of the structuring element used for the morphological operation. It is an important parameter because it affects the extent of the transformation applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Morphology node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Morphology node represents the result of applying the selected morphological operation to the input image. It represents the final state of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Morphology node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if an invalid operation is specified in the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "If an invalid operation is specified, the Morphology node will raise a ValueError indicating that the operation is invalid and must be one of 'erode', 'dilate', 'open', 'close', 'gradient', 'tophat', 'bottomhat'."
