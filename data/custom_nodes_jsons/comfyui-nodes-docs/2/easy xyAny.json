        "question": "What is the purpose of the xyAny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The xyAny node in ComfyUI is designed to reorganize input data into a structured format aligned with either a horizontal or vertical direction. It simplifies data manipulation tasks by efficiently pairing elements based on the specified direction, enhancing the usability of the data in subsequent processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the xyAny node?",
        "answer": "The xyAny node requires three input parameters: 'X' (elements from the first group), 'Y' (elements from the second group), and 'direction' (specifying the pairing direction, either 'horizontal' or 'vertical')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'X' parameter in the xyAny node?",
        "answer": "The 'X' parameter represents the first group of elements to be paired with elements in 'Y'. It is crucial for establishing one side of the data pairing, which is essential for the node's operation and the resulting data structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Y' parameter in the xyAny node?",
        "answer": "The 'Y' parameter represents the second group of elements to be paired with elements in 'X'. It plays a vital role in the node's functionality as it determines the other side of the data pairing, directly influencing the final arrangement of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'direction' parameter affect the output of the xyAny node?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter specifies the pairing direction for the data (either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'). It is essential as it defines the structure of the output, guiding the node on how to arrange elements from 'X' and 'Y' into the desired format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the xyAny node?",
        "answer": "The xyAny node outputs two restructured sequences: 'X' (elements from the original 'X' input, now paired with 'Y' elements based on the specified direction) and 'Y' (structurally similar to output 'X' but composed of elements from the 'Y' input). Both outputs represent the two halves of the node's output, transformed to satisfy the requirements of horizontal or vertical arrangement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the xyAny node use?",
        "answer": "The xyAny node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
