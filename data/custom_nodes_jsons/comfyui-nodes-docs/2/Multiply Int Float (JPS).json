        "question": "What is the purpose of the Multiply Int Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float node in ComfyUI is specifically designed to perform multiplication operations between integers and floating-point numbers, generating both integer and floating-point results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Multiply Int Float node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Multiply Int Float node are 'int_a' which represents the integer value to be multiplied, and 'float_b' which represents the floating-point number to be multiplied with the integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data types are used for the inputs 'int_a' and 'float_b'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for 'int_a' is INT, and for 'float_b' it is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Multiply Int Float node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Multiply Int Float node are 'int_multiply' which is the integer result of the multiplication, and 'float_multiply' which is the floating-point result of the multiplication."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Multiply Int Float node use?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Multiply Int Float node classified?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float node is classified in the 'JPS Nodes/Math' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Multiply Int Float node calculate the multiplication results?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float node calculates the multiplication results by multiplying the integer value 'int_a' with the floating-point value 'float_b', and returns both the integer and floating-point results."
