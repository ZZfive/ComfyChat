        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeedExplorer __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeedExplorer __Inspire node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the exploration and management of seed values during the generation process. It allows for dynamic adjustment and application of seed values to influence the generation process, providing a way to explore variations while ensuring consistency in the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeedExplorer __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeedExplorer __Inspire node are: latent, seed_prompt, enable_additional, additional_seed, additional_strength, noise_mode, and initial_batch_seed_mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeedExplorer __Inspire node enhance the controllability and diversity of generated results?",
        "answer": "The SeedExplorer __Inspire node enhances the controllability and diversity of generated results by manipulating seed values. It allows users to specify seed values and their expected effects through the seed_prompt input, and further refine the generation process using additional seed and strength parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the noise output represent in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The noise output in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node represents the processed noise tensor after applying the seed values and additional parameters. It is the direct output of the seed exploration process and serves as the basis for subsequent image generation or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the noise_mode parameter affect the performance and efficiency of the generation process in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The noise_mode parameter in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node specifies whether noise generation should be performed on the GPU or CPU, which affects the performance and efficiency of the generation process. It provides flexibility for users with different hardware configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the initial_batch_seed_mode parameter in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The initial_batch_seed_mode parameter in the SeedExplorer __Inspire node determines the seed application mode for the initial batch, influencing how seeds are applied and varied across multiple generation processes. It helps achieve the desired consistency or variability in batch generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeedExplorer __Inspire node handle invalid or erroneous input values?",
        "answer": "The SeedExplorer __Inspire node handles invalid or erroneous input values by catching exceptions and printing error messages. It ignores the problematic input and continues the generation process with default or fallback values to ensure the stability of the node."
