        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently load and integrate control networks into the system. It abstracts the complexity of loading control networks, ensuring a smooth and reliable loading process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the control_net_name parameter in the ControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The control_net_name parameter is crucial for identifying the specific control network to be loaded. It plays a key role in the node's operation by directing the node to the correct resource, thus influencing the execution and outcome of the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ControlNetLoader node is a control network structure, which is essential for subsequent processing and analysis in the system. The control network encapsulates the rules and interactions that govern a specific system, making it a fundamental output for applications that rely on control network logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ControlNetLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetLoader node belongs to the 'loaders' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the load_controlnet function in the ControlNetLoader class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the load_controlnet function in the ControlNetLoader class is a tuple containing a torch.nn.Module object representing the loaded control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ControlNetLoader node determine the path for loading a control network?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetLoader node determines the path for loading a control network by using the control_net_name parameter and the folder_paths.get_full_path function, which constructs the full path to the control network based on the provided control_net_name."
