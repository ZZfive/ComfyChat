        "question": "What is the purpose of the SDXL Prompt Handling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SDXL Prompt Handling node is designed to process and optimize text prompts for image generation tasks, specifically optimized for the SDXL model. It focuses on refining and constructing the input prompts to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SDXL Prompt Handling node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SDXL Prompt Handling node are 'handling', 'pos_g', and 'pos_l'. 'handling' specifies the method for combining or selecting the positive prompts, 'pos_g' represents the global positive prompt, and 'pos_l' represents the local positive prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Copy Positive_G to Both' handling option do in the SDXL Prompt Handling node?",
        "answer": "When the 'Copy Positive_G to Both' handling option is selected, the global positive prompt ('pos_g') is copied to the local positive prompt ('pos_l'), effectively using the same prompt for both global and local contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the 'Ignore Positive_G Input' handling option is chosen in the SDXL Prompt Handling node?",
        "answer": "When the 'Ignore Positive_G Input' handling option is selected, the global positive prompt ('pos_g') is set to an empty string, effectively ignoring the global prompt input."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Combine Positive_G + Positive_L' handling option work in the SDXL Prompt Handling node?",
        "answer": "When the 'Combine Positive_G + Positive_L' handling option is selected, the global positive prompt ('pos_g') and the local positive prompt ('pos_l') are combined into a single prompt using the format 'pos_g . pos_l'. The combined prompt is then used for both the global and local contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SDXL Prompt Handling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SDXL Prompt Handling node consists of two processed prompts: 'pos_g' (processed global positive prompt) and 'pos_l' (processed local positive prompt), which reflect the selected handling strategy and are optimized for use with the SDXL model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the SDXL Prompt Handling node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the SDXL Prompt Handling node is 'CPU'."
