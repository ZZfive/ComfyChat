    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of cg-noise is to allow for small variations in the initial noise used for image generation in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in the initial noise?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in the initial noise by using a weight 'x' and two seeds. It generates the noise based on the formula: random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two seeds used by cg-noise for generating variations?",
        "answer": "cg-noise uses two seeds for generating variations: variation_seed and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the weight 'x' in cg-noise?",
        "answer": "The weight 'x' in cg-noise determines the influence of the variation_seed on the generated noise. It is used to balance the contribution of the variation_seed and the original seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users control the variations introduced by cg-noise?",
        "answer": "Users can control the variations introduced by cg-noise by adjusting the weight 'x' and providing different values for variation_seed and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is cg-noise a built-in node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, cg-noise is not a built-in node in ComfyUI. It is a custom node that extends the functionality of ComfyUI."
