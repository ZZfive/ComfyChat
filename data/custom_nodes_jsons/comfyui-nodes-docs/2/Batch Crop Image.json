    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the BatchCropImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'image_directory' which specifies the path to the directory containing the images to be cropped. The optional input type is 'crop_amount' which determines the proportion of the image to be cropped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BatchCropImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BatchCropImage node is 'image', which consists of a list of cropped images converted to tensor format, ready for further processing."

    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchCropImage node determine the size of the cropped image?",
        "answer": "The BatchCropImage node determines the size of the cropped image based on the 'crop_amount' parameter, which specifies the proportion of the image to be cropped. The actual number of pixels to be cropped is calculated as 'int(width * crop_amount) // 8 * 8'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified image directory does not exist?",
        "answer": "If the specified image directory does not exist, the BatchCropImage node will raise an exception with the message 'Image directory {image_directory} does not exist'."
