        "question": "What is the purpose of the OobaPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OobaPrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to generate detailed image descriptions by processing prompts and interacting with AI text-to-image models. It enhances input prompts through various modes to guide the AI model in creating specific types of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the OobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the OobaPrompt node are 'input_prompt' and 'mode'. 'input_prompt' is a descriptive text that influences the AI model's understanding of the image to be generated, and 'mode' determines the type of processing the node will perform on the input prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' parameter in the OobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the OobaPrompt node is important for generating reproducible sequences of images. It ensures that the same input prompt will produce the same output when given the same seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the OobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the OobaPrompt node is 'text', which represents the detailed description used by the AI model to generate images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'custom_history' parameter do in the OobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'custom_history' parameter in the OobaPrompt node allows users to provide a set of personalized prompts to influence the AI model. It should point to a file containing historical prompt data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the OobaPrompt node handle different modes?",
        "answer": "The OobaPrompt node handles different modes by using a history function to process input prompts according to the selected mode. Each mode corresponds to a different way of enhancing the prompt to achieve specific image generation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for running the OobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The OobaPrompt node requires a CPU infrastructure type to run."
