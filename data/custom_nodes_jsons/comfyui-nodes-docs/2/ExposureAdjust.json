        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExposureAdjust node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExposureAdjust node in ComfyUI is designed to modify the exposure of an image by adjusting its brightness levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ExposureAdjust node include the input image, stops value, input color mode, output color mode, a boolean flag for tone mapping, and a tone map scale value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'stops' parameter affect the exposure adjustment in the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The 'stops' parameter determines the degree of exposure adjustment. Positive values increase exposure (brighten the image), while negative values decrease exposure (darken the image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What color modes are supported by the ExposureAdjust node for input and output images?",
        "answer": "The ExposureAdjust node supports 'sRGB' and 'linear' color modes for both input and output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the tone mapping feature be enabled in the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The tone mapping feature can be enabled by setting the 'use_tonemap' parameter to True in the ExposureAdjust node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The 'tonemap_scale' parameter adjusts the scale of the tone mapping effect, providing control over the compression of the image's dynamic range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ExposureAdjust node is an IMAGE, which is a torch.Tensor in Python."
