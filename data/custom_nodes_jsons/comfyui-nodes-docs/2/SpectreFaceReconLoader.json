        "question": "What is the purpose of the SpectreFaceReconLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SpectreFaceReconLoader node is designed to initialize and load the Spectre model and facial tracker for face recognition tasks in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fp16' input parameter determine in the SpectreFaceReconLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'fp16' input parameter determines whether to load the model in half-precision (FP16) format, which can reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance on compatible hardware."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'fp16' input parameter in the SpectreFaceReconLoader node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'fp16' input parameter is BOOLEAN in ComfyUI and bool in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SpectreFaceReconLoader node return as output?",
        "answer": "The SpectreFaceReconLoader node returns a tuple containing the initialized facial tracker and Spectre model, which can be used for face recognition tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the SpectreFaceReconLoader node in ComfyUI and Python?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the SpectreFaceReconLoader node is SPECTRE_MODEL in ComfyUI and Tuple[FaceTracker, SPECTRE] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SpectreFaceReconLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SpectreFaceReconLoader node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the load function of the SpectreFaceReconLoader node is called?",
        "answer": "When the load function of the SpectreFaceReconLoader node is called, it initializes the face tracker, downloads the necessary models, sets up the configuration parameters, and returns the initialized face tracker and Spectre model."
