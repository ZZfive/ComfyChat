        "question": "What is the purpose of the TESTNODE_ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TESTNODE_ node is designed to analyze and process lists of any type of element. It uses the ListStatistics tool to count the occurrences of different data types in the list and provides a summary of the data composition. The node also dynamically imports and executes functions from external modules, demonstrating its adaptability in handling various operations based on the input list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ANY parameter in the TESTNODE_ node?",
        "answer": "The ANY parameter is a versatile input that accepts a list of elements of any type. It is the foundation of the node's operations, as it directly affects the type counting and subsequent execution of external functions. The diversity of elements in ANY influences the results of the node's analysis and function execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the result parameter in the TESTNODE_ node contain?",
        "answer": "The result parameter contains the output of the type counting operation performed by the ListStatistics tool. It is important because it provides detailed information about the types of elements in the input list and their respective counts. This information is crucial for understanding the composition of the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ui parameter in the TESTNODE_ node?",
        "answer": "The ui parameter is a structured output that includes the data and its type information. It is designed to facilitate the display of the node's results in a user interface. The data field contains the results of the type counting, while the type field indicates the data type of the first element in the input list."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TESTNODE_ node handle external function execution?",
        "answer": "The TESTNODE_ node dynamically imports and executes functions from an external module named test.py. It uses the importlib library to load the module and retrieve the run function. The function is then executed with the ANY parameter as its argument."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the TESTNODE_ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the TESTNODE_ node is CPU, indicating that the node runs on a CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the TESTNODE_ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TESTNODE_ node belongs to the ♾️Mixlab/__TEST category in ComfyUI."
