    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_LoadScheduleFromFile node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_LoadScheduleFromFile node are input_file_path, file_name, and file_extension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the input_file_path parameter specify?",
        "answer": "The input_file_path parameter specifies the directory where the schedule file is located, which is crucial for the node to correctly identify and access the file containing the schedule data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the file_name parameter?",
        "answer": "The file_name parameter indicates the name of the schedule file to be loaded and plays a vital role in file identification, ensuring that the node processes the correct dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the file_extension parameter contribute to the functionality of the CR_LoadScheduleFromFile node?",
        "answer": "The file_extension parameter determines the format of the schedule file, allowing the node to apply the correct parsing method, which is essential for ensuring that the data is accurately read and interpreted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_LoadScheduleFromFile node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_LoadScheduleFromFile node are SCHEDULE and show_text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SCHEDULE output provide?",
        "answer": "The SCHEDULE output provides the parsed content of the schedule file, which can be used in the animation environment and represents the structured data extracted from the file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the show_text output?",
        "answer": "The show_text output provides a textual representation of the parsed schedule data, which can be used for display or debugging purposes within the application."
