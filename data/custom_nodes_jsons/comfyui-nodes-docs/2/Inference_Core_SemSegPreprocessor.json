    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which represents the image to be processed. It is crucial for the node to perform necessary adjustments and enhancements to prepare the image for segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node specifies the target resolution required for image preprocessing. It plays a key role in resizing the image to meet the segmentation model's requirements, affecting the quality and accuracy of the segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which represents the preprocessed image ready for semantic segmentation analysis. This output is the result of applying various preprocessing steps aimed at enhancing and formatting the image for optimal segmentation performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node use?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node uses the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node perform semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SemSegPreprocessor node performs semantic segmentation by using the UniformerSegmentor model from the controlnet_aux.uniformer module. It calls the common_annotator_call function with the model, image, and resolution parameters to obtain the segmented output."
