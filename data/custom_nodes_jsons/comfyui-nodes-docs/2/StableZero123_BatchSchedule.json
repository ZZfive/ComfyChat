        "question": "What is the purpose of the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StableZero123_BatchSchedule class in ComfyUI is responsible for processing images and generating latent representations. It accepts various parameters such as visual model outputs, initial images, VAE models, and other settings to process images and generate latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class are clip_vision (CLIP vision model output), init_image (initial image for processing), and vae (variational autoencoder model)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the interpolation parameter in StableZero123_BatchSchedule class do?",
        "answer": "The interpolation parameter in the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class allows selecting different interpolation methods when resizing images. It affects the smoothness and appearance of the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class are positive (positive conditioning data), negative (negative conditioning data), and latent (latent image samples)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class handle angle interpolation?",
        "answer": "The StableZero123_BatchSchedule class handles angle interpolation by using the provided azimuth and elevation points. It applies different easing functions to achieve smooth transitions based on the selected interpolation method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the encode method in the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class?",
        "answer": "The encode method in the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class is responsible for processing the input image, generating latent representations, and producing positive and negative conditioning data based on the provided parameters and settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the StableZero123_BatchSchedule class is GPU."
