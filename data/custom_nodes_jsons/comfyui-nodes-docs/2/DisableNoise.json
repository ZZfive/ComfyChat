        "question": "What is the purpose of the DisableNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DisableNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to suppress noise during the sampling process, ensuring that the output does not contain any random elements. It serves as a critical component in scenarios where deterministic results are required, providing a noise-free path for generating latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the seed parameter in the DisableNoise node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter in the DisableNoise node is used to initialize the noise generation process. Although it is not mandatory, it plays a crucial role in ensuring the reproducibility of results, allowing consistent outcomes across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DisableNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DisableNoise node is an instance of the Noise_EmptyNoise class, which represents a noise-free state. It signifies that there is no noise in the generated latent image, aligning with the node's purpose of providing deterministic output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DisableNoise node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DisableNoise node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DisableNoise node?",
        "answer": "The category of the DisableNoise node is 'sampling/custom_sampling/noise'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DisableNoise node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DisableNoise node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the get_noise function in the DisableNoise class?",
        "answer": "The get_noise function in the DisableNoise class returns a tuple containing an instance of Noise_EmptyNoise."
