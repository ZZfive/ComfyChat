        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoraInfo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoraInfo node is designed to retrieve and provide detailed information about specific LoRa (Low-Power, Long-Range) configurations, including their output features, trigger words, example prompts, and associated base models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'lora_name' input in the LoraInfo node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' input is crucial for identifying the specific LoRa configuration for which information is being requested, enabling the retrieval of relevant data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'lora_name' input in the LoraInfo node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' input uses the COMBO[STRING] data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to the str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs are provided by the LoraInfo node?",
        "answer": "The LoraInfo node provides two outputs: 'trigger_words' and 'example_prompt'. 'trigger_words' offers insights into how the specified LoRa configuration is used, while 'example_prompt' demonstrates how to use the configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'trigger_words' and 'example_prompt' outputs in the LoraInfo node?",
        "answer": "Both 'trigger_words' and 'example_prompt' outputs use the STRING data type in ComfyUI, corresponding to the str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ui' output in the LoraInfo node?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' output provides a structured representation of the LoRa information, including text output, model details, and optionally, example images and prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the LoraInfo node use?",
        "answer": "The LoraInfo node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
