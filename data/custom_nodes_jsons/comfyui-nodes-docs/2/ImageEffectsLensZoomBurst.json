        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node in ComfyUI is used to apply a zoom burst effect to images, creating a dynamic, motion-like visual effect by altering the image's appearance through scaling, rotation, and optional stabilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node are: images (the input images to apply the zoom burst effect), scale (the scaling factor for the effect), samples (the number of samples used to create the effect), position_x and position_y (the x and y coordinates of the effect's center), rotation (the rotation angle applied with the effect), method (the method used to apply the effect), and stabilization (whether to apply stabilization techniques to reduce potential blur or distortion)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node is an image that has the zoom burst effect applied, showcasing the transformed visual appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'method' input parameter affect the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'method' input parameter determines the technique used to apply the zoom burst effect, potentially influencing the appearance and performance of the effect. The available options are 'circle' and 'point'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'stabilization' input parameter do in the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node?",
        "answer": "The 'stabilization' input parameter indicates whether to apply stabilization techniques to reduce potential blur or distortion effects, enhancing the visual clarity of the zoom burst."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst node is classified under the 'image/effects/lens' category in ComfyUI."
