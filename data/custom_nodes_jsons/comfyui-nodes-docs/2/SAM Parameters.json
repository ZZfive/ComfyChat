        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_SAM_Parameters node in the WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The WAS_SAM_Parameters node is designed to process and format input data for image masking operations in the WAS Suite. It accepts points and labels to generate parameters crucial for subsequent masking processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'points' parameter in the WAS_SAM_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'points' parameter is essential for defining the coordinates used for masking in an image. It is a string containing a series of points, each represented by its x and y coordinates. This parameter directly affects the accuracy of the masking process by identifying the areas of interest in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'labels' parameter in the WAS_SAM_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'labels' parameter assigns classification labels to the provided points, which is crucial for distinguishing different types of regions in the image during the masking operation. It is a string containing a list of labels corresponding to each point. This parameter is essential for classifying and organizing image segments during the masking process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'parameters' output represent in the WAS_SAM_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'parameters' output is a structured representation of the input points and labels, formatted into a dictionary compatible with the requirements of the image masking process. It encapsulates the processed data, making it ready for use in downstream masking operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_SAM_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_SAM_Parameters node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_SAM_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_SAM_Parameters node is WAS Suite/Image/Masking."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the WAS_SAM_Parameters node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the WAS_SAM_Parameters node is not an output node."
