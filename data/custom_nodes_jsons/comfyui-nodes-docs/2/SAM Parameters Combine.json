        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node is designed to merge two sets of parameters related to the Semantic Affinity Model (SAM). Its role is to integrate multiple parameter sets into a unified structure, which is crucial for operations that require combining data from different SAM instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node are two sets of SAM parameters: sam_parameters_a and sam_parameters_b. Both contain initial data points and labels that are essential for the merging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node is a unified set of parameters that combines data from the two input SAM parameter sets. This output serves as the foundation for further processing and analysis in the domain of image and masking."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node combine the two input SAM parameter sets?",
        "answer": "The WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node combines the two input SAM parameter sets by concatenating their 'points' and 'labels' using np.concatenate. This results in a unified parameter set containing merged data from both inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node is SAM_PARAMETERS, which represents a dictionary containing the combined 'points' and 'labels' from the input SAM parameter sets."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_SAM_Combine_Parameters node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
