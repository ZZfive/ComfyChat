        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImagePadWithBBox node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImagePadWithBBox node in ComfyUI is used to precisely pad an image with a bounding box, ensuring that the image is properly framed and ready for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImagePadWithBBox node are: bbox (BBOX), width (INT), height (INT), and image (IMAGE)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the bbox parameter determine in the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The bbox parameter determines the region of interest in the image. It specifies from which coordinates the image will be cropped and padded accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the width parameter specify in the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The width parameter specifies the desired width of the output image after padding, affecting the overall size and aspect ratio of the final product."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the height parameter define in the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The height parameter defines the desired height of the output image after padding, directly influencing the final presentation and layout of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImagePadWithBBox node is an image (IMAGE), which is the result of the padding process, showing an appropriately framed and sized image ready for subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the ImagePadWithBBox node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the ImagePadWithBBox node is CPU."
