        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ImageInputSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ImageInputSwitch node is designed to conditionally select one of two image inputs based on a single integer input. It operates by evaluating the integer value and returning the corresponding image, ensuring the output matches the selected input."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which scenarios is the CR_ImageInputSwitch node particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The CR_ImageInputSwitch node is particularly useful in scenarios that require dynamically changing the image data flow based on user input or other conditional logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Input' parameter in the CR_ImageInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter is a critical integer that determines which image will be selected as the output. It directly influences the decision process of the node, allowing for conditional routing of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two optional parameters in the CR_ImageInputSwitch node and their roles?",
        "answer": "The two optional parameters are 'image1' and 'image2'. 'image1' represents the first image option the node can select, and it plays a crucial role when the 'Input' value specifies 'image1' as the output. 'image2' is the second image option the node can select, and it becomes important when the 'Input' value indicates 'image2' should be the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'IMAGE' output in the CR_ImageInputSwitch node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'IMAGE' output is the image selected based on the 'Input' parameter. It represents the result of the node's conditional logic and is crucial for further processing in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_ImageInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL to the node's documentation, offering guidance to users on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the CR_ImageInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the CR_ImageInputSwitch node is CPU."
