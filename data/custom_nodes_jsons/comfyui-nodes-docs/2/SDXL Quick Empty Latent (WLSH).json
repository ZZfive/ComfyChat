        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node is responsible for creating an empty latent space representation for images in ComfyUI. It operates by accepting image resolution and orientation parameters, then generating a latent tensor filled with zeros. This latent tensor is used in the image generation pipeline for further processing or analysis, providing a foundational structure that can be modified to represent various image features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node are 'resolution', which defines the size of the image for which the latent space is to be generated, and 'direction', which specifies the orientation of the image and can be either 'landscape' or 'portrait'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter in the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node control?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter in the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node indicates the number of images to be processed in a single operation. It is an optional parameter that can be used to control the efficiency of processing, allowing for multiple images to be handled simultaneously."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node includes 'latent', which provides the generated latent space tensor that forms the basis for image generation, 'width', which represents the adjusted width of the latent space and is a multiple of 8, and 'height', which represents the adjusted height of the latent space, also a multiple of 8."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'latent' output of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node structured?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node is a tensor filled with zeros. It is structured based on the batch size and the adjusted height and width of the image, providing a foundational structure that can be modified to represent the desired image features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node use?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node uses 'CPU' as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the WLSH_SDXL_Quick_Empty_Latent node defines the class and its methods, including the initialization method, input types, return types, function category, and the generate method which creates the empty latent space based on the provided parameters."
