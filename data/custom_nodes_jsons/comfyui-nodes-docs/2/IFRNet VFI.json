        "question": "What is the purpose of the IFRNet_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IFRNet_VFI node in ComfyUI is designed to perform video frame interpolation, enhancing the smoothness of transitions between frames in a video sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the IFRNet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter is crucial for loading the pretrained model weights required for the frame interpolation process. It determines the specific model architecture and its corresponding weights to be used by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter affect the output of the IFRNet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter defines the rate at which new frames are inserted between the original frames. A higher multiplier results in a higher frame rate for the output video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'scale_factor' parameter play in the IFRNet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_factor' parameter is used to adjust the resolution of the input frames before processing. It can be used to scale the frames up or down as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_frames' parameter represent in the IFRNet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_frames' parameter represents the result of the frame interpolation process. It contains the original frames along with the newly generated intermediate frames, resulting in a smoother video sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter in the IFRNet_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter is used to optimize memory usage during the frame interpolation process. It specifies the number of frames after which the cache should be cleared to free up memory."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IFRNet_VFI node utilize deep learning models?",
        "answer": "The IFRNet_VFI node utilizes deep learning models to generate intermediate frames, thereby increasing the frame rate without sacrificing visual quality."
