        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Color Shift node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Color Shift node in ComfyUI is used to adjust the color balance of an image by applying multipliers to the red, green, and blue color channels, allowing for precise color correction or creative color adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Color Shift node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Color Shift node are: image (the input image to apply color shift), red_multiplier (multiplier for the red channel), green_multiplier (multiplier for the green channel), and blue_multiplier (multiplier for the blue channel)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the red_multiplier input control in the Image Color Shift node?",
        "answer": "The red_multiplier input in the Image Color Shift node controls the intensity of the red color in the image. It is a float value with a default of 1.0 and a minimum of 0.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Color Shift node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Color Shift node is an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: DreamImage), which is the resulting image after applying the color shift adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the Image Color Shift node require GPU for processing?",
        "answer": "No, the Image Color Shift node uses CPU for processing, as indicated by the Infra type in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the recolor function do in the source code of the Image Color Shift node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the Image Color Shift node, the recolor function takes a DreamImage object and applies the color adjustments using the provided red, green, and blue multipliers, then returns the modified image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the result function in the Image Color Shift node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the result function in the Image Color Shift node is a DreamImage object, which represents the processed image after applying the color shift."
