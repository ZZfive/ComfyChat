        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method in the WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend_With_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method is designed to blend a source image onto a target image within specified boundaries using a mask to control the blending process. It intelligently applies a blending factor to determine the extent of the blend and optionally uses a feathering effect to smooth the transition between images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method are: target image, target mask, target bounds, and source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target_mask input do in the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method?",
        "answer": "The target_mask input defines the area within the target image where the blending will occur. It plays a key role in determining which parts of the target image are affected by the source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the blend_factor input in the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method?",
        "answer": "The blend_factor input controls the intensity of the blend between the source image and the target image. It allows for fine-tuning the blending effect to achieve the desired visual outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the feathering input affect the output in the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method?",
        "answer": "The feathering input determines the amount of feathering applied to the mask, which smooths the edges of the blending area for a more natural transition. It enhances the aesthetic quality of the blended image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'bounded_image_blend_with_mask' method is a result_image, which is the generated image after the blending process, reflecting the combined visual elements of the source and target images within the specified boundaries and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend_With_Mask class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend_With_Mask class uses the CPU infra type."
