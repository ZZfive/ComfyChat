    {
        "question": "How does the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node generate the six sinusoidal curves?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node generates the six sinusoidal curves by using the `main` function from its superclass, passing the `n=6` and `wavelength` parameters. This results in the creation of six entangled sinusoidal curves with different phase differences."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx6 node is implemented by inheriting from the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelength class and overriding the `RETURN_TYPES` attribute with a tuple of six 'KEYFRAMED_CURVE' elements. The `main` function is called with the `n=6` and `wavelength` parameters to generate the six sinusoidal curves."
