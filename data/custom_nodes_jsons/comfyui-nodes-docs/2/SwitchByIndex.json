        "question": "What is the purpose of the SwitchByIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SwitchByIndex node in ComfyUI is designed to select elements from two input lists based on a specified index, allowing for the combination and flattening of data structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SwitchByIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SwitchByIndex node are 'A' (the first input list), 'B' (the second input list), and 'index' (which selects specific elements from the combined list)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'flat' parameter in the SwitchByIndex node do?",
        "answer": "The optional 'flat' parameter in the SwitchByIndex node determines whether the output list should be flattened, affecting the structure of the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SwitchByIndex node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SwitchByIndex node are 'C' (a list containing elements from the two input lists, potentially modified by the 'index' and 'flat' parameters) and 'count' (the total number of elements in the 'C' list)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'index' parameter affect the output of the SwitchByIndex node?",
        "answer": "If the 'index' parameter is greater than -1, the SwitchByIndex node will try to select the element at the specified index from the combined list. If the index is valid, the output 'C' will contain only the selected element; otherwise, 'C' will be an empty list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SwitchByIndex node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SwitchByIndex node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SwitchByIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SwitchByIndex node belongs to the '♾️Mixlab/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
