        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node is used to merge two different model architectures into a unified model, focusing on integrating components such as input blocks, middle blocks, and output blocks, as well as specific transformer elements to enhance model performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node include model1, model2, time_embed., label_emb., input_blocks.i, middle_block.i, output_blocks.i, and out., which are essential for merging and adjusting the behaviors of various components in the integrated model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_blocks.i' parameter control in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_blocks.i' parameter controls the blending of the i-th input block of the two models, where i ranges from 0 to 8, determining the initial processing of the input. Each index specifies the contribution of a specific input block, directly affecting the initial stage of data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'middle_block.i' parameter influence the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The 'middle_block.i' parameter affects the contribution of the i-th middle block, where i ranges from 0 to 2, and is crucial for the middle calculations of the model. These parameters are vital in deciding the behavior of the middle processing stage, influencing the overall computation flow of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'output_blocks.i' parameter in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_blocks.i' parameter influences the role of the i-th output block, where i ranges from 0 to 8, affecting the final output generation. Each index determines the impact of a specific output block on the final model output, playing a significant role in output features."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'out.' parameter adjust the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The 'out.' parameter adjusts the behavior of the overall output layer, fine-tuning the final model output features. This parameter is essential for the final adjustment of the model output, allowing precise control over the output features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node is a merged model that integrates the characteristics and capabilities of the two input models. This output is a new, enhanced model that leverages the advantages of the input models to achieve better performance."
