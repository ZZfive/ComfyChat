        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceRestoreModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node is designed to load and initialize facial restoration models based on the provided model name, ensuring that the appropriate model is ready for further processing in facial restoration tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model_name' parameter in the FaceRestoreModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' parameter is crucial as it specifies the unique identifier of the facial restoration model to be loaded. It affects the entire loading process and the subsequent performance of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FaceRestoreModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FaceRestoreModelLoader node is the loaded facial restoration model, which is essential for performing high-quality facial restoration tasks."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the FaceRestoreModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node requires a GPU as the infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FaceRestoreModelLoader node handle CodeFormer models?",
        "answer": "If the model name contains 'codeformer', the FaceRestoreModelLoader node loads the CodeFormer model using the specified model path, device, and network architecture. It then returns the evaluated CodeFormer model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the model name does not contain 'codeformer' in the FaceRestoreModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "If the model name does not contain 'codeformer', the FaceRestoreModelLoader node loads the model using the specified model path, safely loads the state dictionary, and returns the evaluated model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FaceRestoreModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node belongs to the 'facerestore_cf' category."
