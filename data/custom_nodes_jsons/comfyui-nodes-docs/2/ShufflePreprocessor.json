        "question": "What is the purpose of ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The purpose of ShufflePreprocessor is to pre-process images by applying a content re-shuffling detection algorithm. This preprocessing step is crucial for tasks that require the identification or operation of re-shuffled content within images, as it enhances the model's capability to recognize and handle such patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ShufflePreprocessor are image, resolution, and seed. The image input is the main data on which the content re-shuffling detection algorithm is applied. The resolution input specifies the resolution to which the input image is adjusted before processing, while the seed input is used to generate random numbers for the re-shuffling detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The output types of ShufflePreprocessor are images. The output images are the result of applying the content re-shuffling detection algorithm, showcasing the detected re-shuffled content in the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "Some usage tips for ShufflePreprocessor include the common node unknown. It is recommended to use the ShufflePreprocessor with a CPU infrastructure type for optimal performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the ShufflePreprocessor class?",
        "answer": "The function of the ShufflePreprocessor class is to preprocess images by applying the content re-shuffling detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The category of the ShufflePreprocessor is ControlNet Preprocessors/T2IAdapter-only."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the default values for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The default value for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor is 512."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The data type of the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor is an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported data types for the image input in ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The supported data types for the image input in ShufflePreprocessor are PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the seed input in ShufflePreprocessor do?",
        "answer": "The seed input in ShufflePreprocessor is used to generate random numbers for the re-shuffling detection process, ensuring the repeatability of the detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum supported resolution for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The maximum supported resolution for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor is not specified in the provided documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum supported resolution for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The minimum supported resolution for the resolution input in ShufflePreprocessor is 64."
