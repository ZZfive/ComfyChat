        "question": "What is the purpose of the `load_model` method in WAS_Upscale_Model_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `load_model` method is responsible for loading and preparing models for image upscaling tasks. It locates the specified model in the designated directory, loads its parameters, and initializes it for use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `model_name` parameter?",
        "answer": "The `model_name` parameter is crucial for identifying the specific model to be loaded. It directs the method to the correct file within the model directory, enabling retrieval and initialization of the required model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output `UPSCALE_MODEL` represent?",
        "answer": "The output `UPSCALE_MODEL` represents the loaded and initialized model, ready for image upscaling tasks. It encapsulates the model's architecture and learned parameters, allowing the model to be applied to new data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the output `MODEL_NAME_TEXT`?",
        "answer": "The output `MODEL_NAME_TEXT` provides the name of the loaded model, which is useful for logging, tracking, or user interface display purposes. It offers a human-readable identifier for the model, facilitating communication and reference throughout the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for WAS_Upscale_Model_Loader?",
        "answer": "The infra type for WAS_Upscale_Model_Loader is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of `UPSCALE_MODEL`?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of `UPSCALE_MODEL` is torch.nn.Module."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of `MODEL_NAME_TEXT`?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of `MODEL_NAME_TEXT` is str."
