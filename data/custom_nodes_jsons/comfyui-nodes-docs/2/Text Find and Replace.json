        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Search_and_Replace node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Search_and_Replace node is designed to perform search and replace operations on a given text. It identifies occurrences of a specified substring within the text and replaces them with a different substring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input parameter for the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The main input parameter for the WAS_Search_and_Replace node is the 'text' parameter, which contains the text to be processed. It is crucial as it determines the context in which the search and replace operation will take place."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'find' parameter specify in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The 'find' parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node specifies the substring that the node will search for within the text. It plays a significant role in determining the scope of the operation, as the node will perform replacements based on this substring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'replace' parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The 'replace' parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node defines the substring that will be used to replace occurrences of the 'find' substring within the text. It is essential to the transformation process as it determines what the new content will be after the replacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result_text' output parameter represent in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The 'result_text' output parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node holds the modified text after the search and replace operation has been completed. It represents the primary result of the node's functionality, showcasing the final state of the text with the specified replacements applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'replacement_count_number' output parameter provide in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The 'replacement_count_number' output parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node provides a count of how many times the 'find' substring was replaced within the text. This numeric value is important as it quantifies the extent of the replacement operation performed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'replacement_count_float' output parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The 'replacement_count_float' output parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace node provides the replacement count in the form of a floating-point number. The replacement count represented in decimal form can be useful in scenarios where further calculations or analysis on the replacement count is needed."
