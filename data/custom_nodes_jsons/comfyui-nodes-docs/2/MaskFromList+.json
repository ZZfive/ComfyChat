        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskFromList+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromList+ node in ComfyUI is used to create a mask from a list of values, allowing for specifying the mask dimensions through width and height parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'values' parameter represent in the MaskFromList+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'values' parameter in the MaskFromList+ node is a list of float numbers representing the intensity values for the mask. Each value corresponds to the intensity of a pixel in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' parameter affect the mask generated by MaskFromList+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter in the MaskFromList+ node specifies the width of the mask to be generated. It determines the horizontal dimension of the mask, playing a crucial role in shaping the size and aspect ratio of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'height' parameter in the MaskFromList+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' parameter in the MaskFromList+ node defines the height of the mask to be generated. It determines the vertical dimension of the mask, affecting the size and aspect ratio of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'mask' parameter represent in the MaskFromList+ node?",
        "answer": "The output 'mask' parameter in the MaskFromList+ node represents the custom mask created based on the provided values and dimensions. It is the mask generated according to the specified width and height, suitable for various image processing applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the MaskFromList+ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the MaskFromList+ node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskFromList+ node's source code ensure that the 'values' are within the valid range?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the MaskFromList+ node, the 'values' are clamped between 0.0 and 1.0 using `torch.clamp(values, 0.0, 1.0)` to ensure they are within the valid range."
