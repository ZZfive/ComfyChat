        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_CycleImages node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_CycleImages node in ComfyUI is designed to cycle through a list of images, providing a mechanism to display images in a specified order with a frame interval. It is particularly suited for creating animations or slideshows from a collection of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types are required for the CR_CycleImages node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_CycleImages node are 'mode' which determines the order of image cycling, and 'image_list' which is the collection of images to be cycled through."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the CR_CycleImages node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the CR_CycleImages node specifies the order in which the images are cycled. Currently, only the 'Sequential' mode is supported, which ensures that images are displayed in the order they appear in the image list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'frame_interval' parameter in the CR_CycleImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' parameter in the CR_CycleImages node specifies the frame delay between the display of each image. It is crucial for controlling the speed of the animation or slideshow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' parameter affect the operation of the CR_CycleImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter determines how many times the image list will be cycled through. It allows control over the duration of the animation or slideshow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_CycleImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter indicates the current position in the cycle, which is used to determine which image is displayed at any given moment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_CycleImages node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_CycleImages node are 'IMAGE', which provides the current cycled image based on the input parameters, and 'show_help', which provides a URL linking to the documentation page for further help or information on node usage."
