        "question": "What is the purpose of the ColorMap class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorMap class in ComfyUI is used to apply a pseudocolor heat map effect to an input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ColorMap class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ColorMap class are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), color_map (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), and opacity (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the opacity parameter control in the ColorMap class?",
        "answer": "The opacity parameter in the ColorMap class controls the transparency of the applied pseudocolor heat map effect. It ranges from 0 to 100, with a default value of 100."
