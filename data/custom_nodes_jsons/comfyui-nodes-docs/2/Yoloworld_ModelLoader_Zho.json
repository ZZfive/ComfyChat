    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class requires the input type 'yolo_world_model', which is of data type 'str' in both Confort dtype and Python dtype. This input type is essential as it specifies the YOLO model variant to be loaded for the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class provides the output type 'yolo_world_model', which is of data type 'YOLOWorld' in both Confort dtype and Python dtype. This output type represents the loaded YOLO model, ready for use in target detection tasks. It provides a structured interface for interacting with the model to perform inference on new data."

    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The Unix type of the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class is CPU, indicating that the class is intended to be used on a CPU environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Category of the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The Category of the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class is 'ðŸ”ŽYOLOWORLD_ESAM', indicating that this class is related to the YOLOWORLD_ESAM category, which likely involves advanced sampling techniques for the detection of various objects or entities in images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the specific class method for the input types of the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The specific class method for the input types of the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class is INPUT_TYPES(), which returns the input types required for the class."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the specific method loaded_yolo_world_model() in the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class?",
        "answer": "The specific method loaded_yolo_world_model() in the Yoloworld_ModelLoader_Zho class loads the YOLO model based on the provided 'yolo_world_model' parameter. It creates a YOLOWorld instance with the specified model ID and returns the loaded model as a list containing a single YOLOWorld object."
