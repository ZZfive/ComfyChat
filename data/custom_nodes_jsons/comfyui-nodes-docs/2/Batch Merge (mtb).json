        "question": "What is the primary function of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI is a GUI that uses a stable diffusion model to generate images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is it referred to as having after it?",
        "answer": "After being exposed to ComfyUI, it is described as having a 3D effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is pm_changing?",
        "answer": "pm_changing is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows changes to be made without affecting the original images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the use of random_changing, random_shifting, and random_mirroring nodes in ComfyUI.",
        "answer": "These nodes are used for random variations in images by generating random values and providing options to change values, shift coordinates, and mirror coordinates respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cg-noise node work?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise node generates noise by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It then generates the noise based on the equation \n`random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the most common uses of ComfyUI custom nodes?",
        "answer": "The most common uses of ComfyUI custom nodes are for generating random variations, creating unique final images, and manipulating the input data during rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the quality of the optical flow in ComfyUI ensured?",
        "answer": "The optical flow quality in ComfyUI is ensured by setting appropriate weights and seeds based on the desired effect."
