        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class is designed to parse and replace text with corresponding embeddings by identifying specific patterns in the input text that match embedding file names and replacing them with a predefined format containing the word 'embedding' followed by the filename."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class is 'text', which provides the raw text data that the node will process. It is of Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class is 'parsed_text', which contains the modified text with appropriately formatted embedding references. It is of Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class uses CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the convert_a1111_embeddings method work?",
        "answer": "The convert_a1111_embeddings method works by iterating through the embedding paths and filenames, compiling a pattern based on the escaped basename, and replacing the matched pattern in the text with the replacement string 'embedding:{}'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the text_parse_embeddings method?",
        "answer": "The text_parse_embeddings method returns a tuple containing the result of the convert_a1111_embeddings method applied to the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_Text_Parse_Embeddings_By_Name class is 'WAS Suite/Text/Parse'."
