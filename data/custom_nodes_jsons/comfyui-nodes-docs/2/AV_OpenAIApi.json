    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AV_OpenAIApi node are the OpenAI API key (openai_api_key) and the API endpoint URL (endpoint)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the OpenAI API key in the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The OpenAI API key is crucial for authenticating requests to the OpenAI service. Without a valid API key, the node will not be able to access OpenAI's services."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the API endpoint URL specify in the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The API endpoint URL specifies the base address for the OpenAI API calls. The default value points to OpenAI's standard API endpoint, but users can modify it as needed, such as when using a custom or proxy server."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AV_OpenAIApi node is llm_api, which returns a configured instance for interacting with OpenAI's API, simplifying the process of making language model requests."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the AV_OpenAIApi node is CPU."
