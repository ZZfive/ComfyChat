        "question": "What is the purpose of the easySeed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easySeed node aims to generate random seeds for various processes, ensuring a certain degree of reproducibility and controllability in the system's random elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the seed parameter in the easySeed node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it determines the starting point of random number generation, thereby affecting the result of the random process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the prompt parameter in the easySeed node?",
        "answer": "Although the prompt parameter is not required, it can provide additional context or guidance for the node's operation, potentially making the randomness more refined to suit specific goals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the extra_pnginfo parameter be used for in the easySeed node?",
        "answer": "The extra_pnginfo parameter, while optional, can provide additional information that may be used to enhance functionality or adjust the behavior of the node in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the my_unique_id parameter help in the easySeed node?",
        "answer": "Providing a unique ID parameter helps track and manage the execution of multiple instances of the node, aiding in the organization of the entire workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the seed output represent in the easySeed node?",
        "answer": "The output seed represents the generated random number, serving as a reference for subsequent operations that depend on this initial random point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the easySeed node use?",
        "answer": "The easySeed node uses the CPU infra type."
