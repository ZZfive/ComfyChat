        "question": "What is the purpose of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node is designed to handle settings for Canny edge detection, returning parameters such as source, strength, start, end, and thresholds. It belongs to the JPS Nodes/Pipes category and focuses on image processing and manipulation by applying the Canny edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node is cannyedge_settings, which specifies the configuration for Canny edge detection, including source, strength, start and end positions, as well as low and high thresholds. This input is crucial for determining how the edge detection is performed and its sensitivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node include cannyedge_source (image source for Canny edge detection), cannyedge_strength (strength of the Canny edge detection effect), cannyedge_start (starting position for applying Canny edge detection), cannyedge_end (ending position for applying Canny edge detection), cannyedge_low (low threshold for Canny edge detection), and cannyedge_high (high threshold for Canny edge detection)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node use?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the cannyedge_low and cannyedge_high parameters in the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The cannyedge_low and cannyedge_high parameters represent the low and high thresholds for Canny edge detection, respectively. These thresholds are used to determine the sensitivity of the edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for the source code of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node is written in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
