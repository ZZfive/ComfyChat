        "question": "What is the purpose of WAS_Image_To_Noise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_To_Noise node in ComfyUI is designed to convert an input image into a noise pattern. It achieves this by quantizing colors, randomizing pixel data, and optionally blending with Gaussian blur to create a noisy aesthetic effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_To_Noise node are 'images', which specifies the input image to be processed into a noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'num_colors' parameter control in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_colors' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node determines the number of colors used to quantize the image, which impacts the complexity of the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'black_mix' parameter affect the output of the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'black_mix' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node controls the amount of black noise mixed into the image, adding a layer of complexity to the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'gaussian_mix' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'gaussian_mix' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node specifies the degree of Gaussian blur to be applied, which can smooth out the noise and create more subtle noise effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'brightness' parameter influence the noise image in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'brightness' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node adjusts the brightness of the noise image, enhancing or reducing the contrast of the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Image_To_Noise node is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring the reproducibility of the noise pattern. It is important for generating consistent results across different runs."
