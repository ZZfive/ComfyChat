        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node is designed to composite two images into a given container according to specified absolute coordinates. It utilizes the container's dimensions to ensure that the images fit perfectly, providing a flexible way to manage image layout within predefined space constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node are: container, images_a, images_b, images_a_x, images_a_y, images_b_x, images_b_y, background, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'container' input represent in the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'container' input represents the container image into which other images will be composited. It defines the spatial boundaries for the compositing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'background' input specify in the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'background' input specifies which image (if any) should be considered the background during the compositing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' input determine in the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' input determines the method used to composite the images, which may affect the final appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node is a single image that results from compositing the input images according to the specified parameters and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
