        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is designed to select a specific preprocessor for ControlNet operations, allowing the system to dynamically adjust the preprocessing strategy based on user input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is 'preprocessor', which specifies the preprocessor to be selected for the operation, enabling the system to adapt to different preprocessing needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'preprocessor' input in the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'preprocessor' input in the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is COMBO[STRING]."

    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'preprocessor' input in the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'preprocessor' input in the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is 'preprocessor', which returns the selected preprocessor for use in subsequent ControlNet operations."
