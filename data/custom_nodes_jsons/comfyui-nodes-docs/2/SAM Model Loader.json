        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class is designed to load and initialize a pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) based on the specified model size. It is crucial for the image masking process and provides the foundation for high-quality object segmentation in the WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available model sizes for the SAM model in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The available model sizes for the SAM model in ComfyUI are 'ViT-H', 'ViT-L', and 'ViT-B'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class is SAM_MODEL, which represents the loaded and ready-to-use Segment Anything Model, a pre-trained deep learning model designed for high-quality object segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the model_size parameter in the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The model_size parameter in the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class is essential for determining the specific SAM model to be loaded. It defines the complexity and size of the model, which directly impacts the performance and accuracy of the segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified SAM model weights do not exist in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "If the specified SAM model weights do not exist, the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class will download the model weights and set up the model for subsequent image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class in ComfyUI is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class handle missing GitPython package in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "If the GitPython package is not found, the WAS_SAM_Model_Loader class will install it using the install_package('gitpython') function."
