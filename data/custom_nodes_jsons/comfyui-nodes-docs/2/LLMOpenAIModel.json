        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMOpenAIModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMOpenAIModel node in ComfyUI is designed to simplify the integration and usage of OpenAI language models. It provides a convenient interface for loading and embedding models, which can be used for various applications such as text generation and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMOpenAIModel node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMOpenAIModel node are 'model', which specifies the OpenAI model to load, 'api_key', which is the API key for authenticating OpenAI service requests, and 'embedding_model', which defines the specific embedding model to be used alongside the main language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multimodal' optional input in the LLMOpenAIModel node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'multimodal' optional input in the LLMOpenAIModel node is a boolean flag that indicates whether the model to be loaded should support multimodal input, allowing for a wider range of input types beyond text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LLMOpenAIModel node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the LLMOpenAIModel node are 'llm_model', which returns the loaded main language model, and 'embed_model_only', which provides the separately loaded embedding model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the LLMOpenAIModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the LLMOpenAIModel node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the LLMOpenAIModel node located in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMOpenAIModel node is located in the 'SALT/Language Toolkit/Loaders' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code function used by the LLMOpenAIModel node to load the model?",
        "answer": "The source code function used by the LLMOpenAIModel node to load the model is 'load_model'."
