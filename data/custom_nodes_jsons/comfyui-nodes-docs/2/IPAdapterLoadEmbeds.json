        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's `load` method?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's `load` method is to retrieve and process embedding data from a specified file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'embeds' parameter in the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node?",
        "answer": "The 'embeds' parameter, which contains a list of file paths for the embedded data storage, is crucial as it guides the node to locate the correct data location, enabling successful loading and processing of the embedding data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node?",
        "answer": "The output of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node is 'EMBEDS', which represents the loaded embedding data as tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the output tensor 'EMBEDS'?",
        "answer": "The output tensor 'EMBEDS' is significant as it is the processed form of the input data, ready for subsequent analysis or model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's `load` method?",
        "answer": "The return type of the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's `load` method is a tuple containing a torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's source code do?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterLoadEmbeds node's source code defines the input types, return types, function, and category of the node. It also contains the `load` method which loads the embedding data from the specified file path and returns it as a tensor."
