        "question": "What is the purpose of the PorterDuffImageComposite node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PorterDuffImageComposite node in ComfyUI is designed to perform image compositing using Porter-Duff compositing operators. It takes a source image and a destination image along with their respective alpha masks and compositing mode to produce a composited image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the PorterDuffImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the PorterDuffImageComposite node are: source image, source alpha mask, destination image, destination alpha mask, and compositing mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source alpha mask define in the PorterDuffImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The source alpha mask in the PorterDuffImageComposite node defines the transparency of the source image and plays an important role in how the source image interacts with the destination image during the compositing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the compositing mode in the PorterDuffImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The compositing mode in the PorterDuffImageComposite node determines the algorithm used to blend the source image with the destination image. It is a crucial parameter that dictates the visual result of the compositing operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs are produced by the PorterDuffImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The outputs produced by the PorterDuffImageComposite node are the composited image, which is the result of blending the source image and destination image according to the specified compositing mode, and the composited alpha, which represents the transparency mask generated during the compositing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the PorterDuffImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the PorterDuffImageComposite node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PorterDuffImageComposite node handle images and alpha masks of different shapes?",
        "answer": "If the shapes of the source image, destination image, source alpha, and destination alpha do not match, the PorterDuffImageComposite node upscales them using a bicubic upscale method to ensure they have the same shape before performing the compositing operation."
