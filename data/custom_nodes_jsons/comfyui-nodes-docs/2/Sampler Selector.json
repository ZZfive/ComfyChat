        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sampler Selector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Selector node is designed to dynamically select and configure sampling strategies for image generation tasks. It allows different sampling algorithms to be chosen based on input parameters, optimizing the image generation process for various scenarios and preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Sampler Selector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Sampler Selector node is 'sampler_name', which specifies the name of the sampler to be used, affecting the choice of sampling algorithm for the image generation task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Sampler Selector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Sampler Selector node is 'sampler_name', which returns the identifier of the configured sampler object that can be directly used for image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Sampler Selector node use?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Selector node uses the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the Sampler Selector node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the Sampler Selector node include ImpactKSamplerBasicPipe, FaceDetailer, KSampler, and KSamplerAdvanced."
