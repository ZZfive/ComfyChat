        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node in ComfyUI is used to apply an advanced Gaussian blur filter to images, allowing separate settings for the blur size and standard deviation in the horizontal and vertical directions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node are: images (the image to be processed), size_x (the horizontal size of the Gaussian kernel), size_y (the vertical size of the Gaussian kernel), sigma_x (the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the horizontal direction), and sigma_y (the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the vertical direction)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_x parameter control in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The size_x parameter in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node specifies the horizontal size of the Gaussian kernel, which affects the amount of blur in the x-axis direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sigma_y parameter control in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The sigma_y parameter in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node determines the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the vertical direction, which affects the spread of the blur in the y-axis direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node is an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) that has been processed with the specified Gaussian blur parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the size_x and size_y parameters in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The default value for both the size_x and size_y parameters in the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node is 10."
