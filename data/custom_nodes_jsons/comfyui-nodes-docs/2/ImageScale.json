        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScale node is designed to improve the resolution of digital images through various upsampling methods. It provides users with a simple interface to scale images by specifying new dimensions or maintaining the aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScale node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScale node are 'image', which is the input digital image to be processed, 'upscale_method', which determines the algorithm used for enlarging the image, and 'crop', which defines whether and how the image should be cropped after upsampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_method' parameter in the ImageScale node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_method' parameter in the ImageScale node determines the algorithm used for enlarging the image. It is crucial as it directly affects the quality and style of the upsampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the ImageScale node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the ImageScale node are 'width' and 'height', which specify the new width and height of the scaled image respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageScale node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageScale node is 'upscaled_image', which represents the image enlarged using the specified method. It is the direct result of the node's processing and the upsampling operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageScale node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageScale node uses CPU as the infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if both 'width' and 'height' parameters are set to 0 in the ImageScale node?",
        "answer": "If both 'width' and 'height' parameters are set to 0 in the ImageScale node, the original image is returned without any scaling."
