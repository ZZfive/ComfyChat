        "question": "What is the main purpose of the WeightAdjustIndivAddNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of WeightAdjustIndivAddNode is to individually adjust model weights by adding specific values to different types of parameters in a structured and modular way."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the pe_ADD parameter allow to adjust in the model?",
        "answer": "The pe_ADD parameter allows adjusting the position encoding weights, which is crucial for fine-tuning the model's understanding of input sequence structure, especially for tasks that rely on the order of elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can adjusting the attn_ADD parameter benefit the model's performance?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the attn_ADD parameter can enhance the model's ability to focus on different parts of the input, potentially improving performance on tasks that require subtle understanding of context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the other_ADD parameter in WeightAdjustIndivAddNode?",
        "answer": "The other_ADD parameter is used to adjust weights that do not fall under predefined categories, providing flexibility in fine-tuning the model in ways not covered by other parameters and allowing for broader adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the print_adjustment flag?",
        "answer": "The print_adjustment flag controls whether the adjustments made to the weights are logged, which is useful for debugging and understanding the impact of the adjustments on the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the prev_weight_adjust parameter?",
        "answer": "The prev_weight_adjust parameter is an optional previous adjustment group that can be applied to the model, allowing for the continuation of a series of adjustments or the application of a predefined set of modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WeightAdjustIndivAddNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of WeightAdjustIndivAddNode is a WEIGHT_ADJUST object, which represents the collective adjustments made to the model weights and can be used to further refine the model or apply the adjustments to another model instance."
