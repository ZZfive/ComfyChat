        "question": "What is the purpose of the SUPIR_Upscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_Upscale node in ComfyUI is designed to improve the resolution of input images through a complex processing procedure, including magnification, color correction, and noise reduction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SUPIR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SUPIR_Upscale node include the path to the SUPIR model checkpoint, the input image to be upscaled, and the number of steps to be used in the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'steps' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node control?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node controls the number of steps used in the diffusion process. More steps usually result in better results but increase computation time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SUPIR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SUPIR_Upscale node is the upscaled_image, which represents the final output of the upscaling process and the main result of the SUPIR_Upscale node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SUPIR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SUPIR_Upscale node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'scale_by' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_by' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node is a floating-point value that controls the scaling of the image, with a default value of 1.0, a minimum of 0.01, and a maximum of 20.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node is True."
