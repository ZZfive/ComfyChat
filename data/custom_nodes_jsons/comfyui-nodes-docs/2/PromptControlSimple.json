        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptControlSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptControlSimple node in ComfyUI encapsulates the functionality of managing and applying prompt schedules and filtering the model to control the generation process. It abstracts the complexity of prompt operations and provides a structured approach to refine the model's output according to specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PromptControlSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PromptControlSimple node are: model, clip, positive, and negative. The model parameter defines the AI system that will process the input and generate output, the clip parameter manages the context and structure of the input data, while the positive and negative parameters guide the model's generation towards desired results and prevent undesired content respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the PromptControlSimple node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the PromptControlSimple node are: tags, start, and end. Tags are used to categorize and filter the generated content, while the start and end parameters define the starting and ending points of the prompt schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PromptControlSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PromptControlSimple node are: model, positive, negative, model_filtered, pos_filtered, and neg_filtered. These outputs represent the updated AI system with applied prompts and filters, the refined positive and negative prompts, and the filtered model and prompts based on specified tags and percentage ranges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PromptControlSimple node refine the model's output?",
        "answer": "The PromptControlSimple node refines the model's output by applying prompt schedules and filters to the model. It uses positive prompts to guide the generation towards desired results, negative prompts to prevent undesired content, and optional tags and percentage ranges to further refine the output based on specific aspects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the PromptControlSimple node use?",
        "answer": "The PromptControlSimple node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the PromptControlSimple node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the PromptControlSimple node defines the input types, return types, category, and the main function 'apply' that processes the inputs and generates the outputs. It also includes the logic for parsing prompt schedules, applying filters, and scheduling the model."
