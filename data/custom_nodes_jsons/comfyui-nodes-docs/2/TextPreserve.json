        "question": "What is the purpose of the TextPreserve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TextPreserve node is designed to process and preserve the original text while allowing dynamic content replacements. It identifies placeholders within the input text and replaces them with random or specified values, ensuring the integrity of the original message throughout the transformation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the TextPreserve node are 'text' and 'result_text'. 'text' is the main input parameter containing the text to be processed, and 'result_text' is where the processed text is stored after the node executes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' input parameter support in the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input parameter in the TextPreserve node supports multiline, allowing for complex and extended text inputs to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unique_id' input parameter in the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' input parameter is used to uniquely identify the node within a workflow. It is optional but can be important for tracking and managing the state and output of the node within a larger system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'prompt' input parameter influence the behavior of the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' input parameter provides dynamic guidance for the text replacement process. It is optional but can significantly affect the node's behavior by introducing context-specific replacements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the TextPreserve node is 'text', which represents the final processed text after all operations have been completed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the TextPreserve node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the TextPreserve node is CPU."
