        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI is designed to manage the operational state of nodes within a workflow. It ensures that nodes are activated, muted, or bypassed based on provided conditions and behaviors, thus controlling the flow of data and execution within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactControlBridge node are 'value' and 'mode'. 'value' is crucial for the node's decision-making process as it determines the initial state that influences subsequent operations in the workflow. 'mode' indicates whether the node should enforce a certain operational state in the workflow, affecting the execution path."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'behavior' parameter allow in the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The 'behavior' parameter in the ImpactControlBridge node allows the application of conditional logic within the node, modifying its response based on specific conditions being met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unique_id' parameter in the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is used to identify specific nodes within the workflow, enabling targeted control and operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter contain?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter contains additional data that the node may require to effectively execute its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' output type reflect in the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' output type reflects the final state after the node's processing, containing the results of the node's operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImpactControlBridge node is CPU."
