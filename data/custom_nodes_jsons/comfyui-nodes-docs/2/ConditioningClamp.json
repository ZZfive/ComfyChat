        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConditioningClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningClamp node is designed to pass conditioning data through unchanged, serving as a placeholder or checkpoint in the data processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ConditioningClamp node?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningClamp node requires an input parameter 'conditioning' of Comfy data type CONDITIONING, which represents the conditioning data to be passed through the node unchanged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'conditioning' input in the ConditioningClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'conditioning' input in the ConditioningClamp node is List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, Any]]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConditioningClamp node?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningClamp node outputs the unmodified conditioning data, emphasizing the node's role as a transparent conduit in the pipeline. The output type is CONDITIONING."
