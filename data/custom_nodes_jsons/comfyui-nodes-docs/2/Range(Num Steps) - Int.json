        "question": "What is the purpose of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI generates a series of integer values based on specified start and end points, number of steps, and end mode. It allows creating evenly or unevenly spaced integer sequences and can include or exclude the end point in the final range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Range(Num Steps) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Range(Num Steps) - Int node are: start (INT), stop (INT), num_steps (INT), end_mode (COMBO[STRING]), and allow_uneven_steps (COMBO[STRING])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end_mode' parameter in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'end_mode' parameter in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node determines whether the end point is included ('Inclusive') or excluded ('Exclusive') from the generated range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'allow_uneven_steps' parameter in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'allow_uneven_steps' parameter in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node indicates whether uneven step sizes between integers in the range are allowed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node are: range (INT) and range_sizes (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'range' output represent in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The 'range' output in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node represents the generated sequence of integers within the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'range_sizes' output represent in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The 'range_sizes' output in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node represents the size of each generated range, indicating how many integers are in each sequence."
