        "question": "What is the purpose of the Evaluate Floats node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Evaluate Floats node in ComfyUI is used to calculate mathematical expressions involving floating point numbers and convert the results into multiple formats (integer, float, and string) for further use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Evaluate Floats node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Evaluate Floats node are 'python_expression', which is the mathematical expression to be evaluated, and 'print_to_console', which indicates whether the evaluation result should be printed to the console."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the Evaluate Floats node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the Evaluate Floats node are variables 'a', 'b', and 'c', which can be used in the 'python_expression' for dynamic evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Evaluate Floats node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Evaluate Floats node are 'int' (integer representation of the evaluated expression result), 'float' (floating point representation of the result), and 'string' (string representation of the result)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Evaluate Floats node handle the 'print_to_console' input?",
        "answer": "If the 'print_to_console' input is set to 'True', the Evaluate Floats node will print the evaluation result to the console, providing visual feedback of the operation result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Evaluate Floats node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Evaluate Floats node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Evaluate Floats node belong?",
        "answer": "The Evaluate Floats node belongs to the 'Efficiency Nodes/Simple Eval' category in ComfyUI."
