        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoraBlockInfo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoraBlockInfo node in ComfyUI extracts and organizes information from Lora models, providing a comprehensive overview of different types of blocks in the model, such as input blocks, middle blocks, output blocks, and text blocks, as well as their respective quantities and associations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LoraBlockInfo node are: model, clip, lora_name, and unique_id."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the lora_name parameter specify in the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The lora_name parameter in the LoraBlockInfo node specifies the Lora model to be analyzed. It is a crucial input that directs the node to the correct data source for block extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the unique_id parameter in the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The unique_id parameter is essential for tracking the execution of the LoraBlockInfo node. It ensures that each instance of the node can be uniquely identified, allowing for precise feedback and error handling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the LoraBlockInfo node is block_info, which serves as user-provided text input and can offer additional context or specifications for the block extraction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the LoraBlockInfo node use?",
        "answer": "The LoraBlockInfo node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoraBlockInfo node provide feedback during execution?",
        "answer": "During execution, the LoraBlockInfo node sends feedback using the PromptServer.instance.send_sync method, providing data such as the node_id, widget_name, type, and the extracted text information."
