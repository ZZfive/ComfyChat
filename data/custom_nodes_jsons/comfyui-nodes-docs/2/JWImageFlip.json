        "question": "What is JWImageFlip used for?",
        "answer": "JWImageFlip is used to flip images in a specified direction, either horizontally or vertically. This is a basic operation in image processing tasks, commonly used to adjust the image direction in scenarios where it is needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does JWImageFlip require?",
        "answer": "JWImageFlip requires two input types: image and direction. The image input is the image tensor that needs flipping, critical for determining which image gets flipped. The direction input specifies the flip direction, either 'horizontal' or 'vertical', deciding how the image will be operated and the final output's orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does JWImageFlip produce?",
        "answer": "JWImageFlip produces an output type, image, which is the tensor of the flipped image. This output is the direct result of applying the specified flip operation to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Infra type for JWImageFlip?",
        "answer": "The Infra type for JWImageFlip is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are common nodes for JWImageFlip?",
        "answer": "The common nodes for JWImageFlip are unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality of JWImageFlip?",
        "answer": "The functionality of JWImageFlip is to execute the execute function, loading an image from a specified path and returning a tuple containing the loaded image."
