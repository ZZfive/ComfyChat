        "question": "What is the purpose of the SweetspotStretchPENode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SweetspotStretchPENode class in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the peak effect (PE) of an animation by stretching or compressing it. This allows for fine-tuning the dynamics of the animation, ensuring that the PE is optimally positioned and scaled for the desired visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'sweetspot' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The 'sweetspot' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode defines the initial length of the peak effect in the animation. It is crucial for determining the starting point of the PE adjustment process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'new_sweetspot' parameter specify in SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The 'new_sweetspot' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode specifies the target length to which the peak effect should be adjusted. It is a key factor in controlling the final appearance of the animation's PE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'print_adjustment' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The 'print_adjustment' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode is a boolean flag that, when set to True, instructs the node to print out detailed information about the PE adjustment process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'prev_pe_adjust' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_pe_adjust' parameter in SweetspotStretchPENode is an optional parameter that represents a previously adjusted group that can be applied to the current PE adjustment. It allows for chained processing of adjustments for complex animation scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SweetspotStretchPENode is a PE_ADJUST, which is an AdjustGroup object containing the new PE adjustment along with any previous adjustments. This object is used to apply the PE adjustment to the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for running SweetspotStretchPENode?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for running SweetspotStretchPENode is CPU."
