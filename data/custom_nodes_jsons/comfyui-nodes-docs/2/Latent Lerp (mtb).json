        "question": "What is the purpose of the<-operator-and->node?",
        "answer": "The<-operator-and->node is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows users to link two nodes, effectively creating a 'and' condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the<-operator-and->node chain nodes?",
        "answer": "The<-operator-and->node chains nodes by specifying two nodes, separated by an 'and'. The output of the first node is used as input for the second node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the<-operator-and->node be used with buffers?",
        "answer": "Yes, the<-operator-and->node can be used with buffers. However, only 'basic' behavior of the node will be used when operating inside a buffer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common use cases for the<-operator-and->node?",
        "answer": "The<-operator-and->node is commonly used in complex workflows where multiple conditions need to be met simultaneously. For example, generating an image based on the intersection of two conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the<-operator-and->node accept multiple input pipelines?",
        "answer": "No, the<-operator-and->node does not accept multiple input pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the<-operator-and->node be used with seed-variable interactions?",
        "answer": "Yes, the<-operator-and->node can be used with seed-variable interactions. This allows for multiple versions of the output being generated based on different seed values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What configuration options does the<-operator-and->node have?",
        "answer": "The<-operator-and->node has two configuration options: 'use-replacement-root' and 'chaining-in-status'. 'use-replacement-root' is a boolean option that determines whether to use the replacement root node for input; 'chaining-in-status' is an integer option that determines the status on how to chain the node."
