        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_DebatchFrames node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_DebatchFrames node is designed to process and split input data into individual frames. It plays a crucial role in preparing data for further analysis or processing in animation workflows, ensuring that each frame can be handled independently."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'frames' parameter in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter is essential because it represents the batch of image frames that the node will process. It influences the execution of the node by determining the input data that will be split into individual frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CR_DebatchFrames node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CR_DebatchFrames node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'debatched_frames' output represent in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The 'debatched_frames' output consists of individual frames extracted from the input batch. This output is important as it forms the basis for subsequent operations in the animation pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'debatched_frames' output in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'debatched_frames' output in the CR_DebatchFrames node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'debatched_frames' output in the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'debatched_frames' output in the CR_DebatchFrames node is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the CR_DebatchFrames node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CR_DebatchFrames node is CPU."
