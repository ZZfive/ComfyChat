        "question": "What is the purpose of the FromListGet1Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Float node is designed to extract a single float value from a given list based on a specified index. It supports random access of the list, including using negative indexes to access elements in reverse order, thus enhancing the flexibility of data manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FromListGet1Float node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FromListGet1Float node are 'list' and 'index'. 'list' is the source list from which the float value will be extracted, and 'index' specifies the position from which to extract the float value from the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FromListGet1Float node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FromListGet1Float node is 'float', which represents the float value extracted from the specified index position of the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the FromListGet1Float node use?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Float node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the FromListGet1Float node support negative indexing?",
        "answer": "Yes, the FromListGet1Float node supports negative indexing, allowing for reverse order access of elements in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the FromListGet1Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the FromListGet1Float node in ComfyUI is 'Bmad/Lists/Get1'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is FromListGet1Float an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, FromListGet1Float is not an output node in ComfyUI."
