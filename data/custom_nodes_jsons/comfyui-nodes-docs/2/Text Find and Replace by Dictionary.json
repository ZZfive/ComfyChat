        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node is designed to perform search and replace operations on a given text using a provided dictionary. It intelligently replaces occurrences of dictionary keys in the text with their corresponding values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node are 'text' (the input text on which the search and replace operation will be executed) and 'dictionary' (a dictionary where the keys are terms to search for in the text and the values are terms that will replace the keys)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'replacement_key' parameter in the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node?",
        "answer": "The 'replacement_key' parameter is a string that is used to wrap keys from the dictionary before searching the text. It helps prevent accidental replacements in parts of the text where they are not intended."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter affect the output of the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter controls the randomness of the replacement process. It ensures reproducibility, allowing for deterministic results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node is 'new_text', which is the generated text after applying the search and replace operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what category does the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node falls under the 'WAS Suite/Text/Search' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Search_and_Replace_Dictionary node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
