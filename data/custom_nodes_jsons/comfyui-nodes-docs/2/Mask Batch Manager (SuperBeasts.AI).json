    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node are 'width' and 'height', which specify the desired output width and height of the masks, and 'ordering_enabled', which enables or disables sorting of input masks based on a specified order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ordering_enabled' parameter do in the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The 'ordering_enabled' parameter allows enabling or disabling sorting of input masks based on a specified order, allowing for custom arrangement of masks before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional mask inputs does the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node support?",
        "answer": "The Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node supports up to 12 optional mask inputs, named 'mask1' through 'mask12'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node is 'mask', which represents the concatenated batch of processed masks that can be used for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no valid masks are provided to the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "If no valid masks are provided to the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node, it will raise a ValueError indicating that no valid masks were provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node is 'GPU'."
