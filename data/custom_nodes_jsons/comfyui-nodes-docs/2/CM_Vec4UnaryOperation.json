        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec4UnaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4UnaryOperation node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various unary operations on a 4-dimensional vector. It can apply different mathematical transformations to the vector, which may be crucial in vector-based calculations in graphics, physics, or other mathematical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Vec4UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Vec4UnaryOperation node are 'op' and 'a'. 'op' is a string that specifies the unary operation to be performed on vector 'a', and 'a' is the 4-dimensional vector on which the unary operation will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the Vec4UnaryOperation node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec4UnaryOperation node specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector 'a'. It is a string that represents the operation itself and is crucial for determining the transformation applied to the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter in the Vec4UnaryOperation node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec4UnaryOperation node represents the 4-dimensional vector on which the unary operation will be applied. It is a fundamental input because the effect of the operation is directly reflected in the transformation of this vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Vec4UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Vec4UnaryOperation node is 'result', which represents the result of applying the unary operation on the input vector 'a'. It is the transformed vector containing the effect of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec4UnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec4UnaryOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the Vec4UnaryOperation node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Vec4UnaryOperation node defines the input types, return types, function, and category for the node. It also includes the 'op' function, which takes the 'op' and 'a' parameters and returns the result of applying the unary operation on the vector 'a'."
