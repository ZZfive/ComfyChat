        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ColorBars node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ColorBars node is designed to generate a visual representation of color bars with customizable parameters such as orientation, frequency, and colors. It provides a versatile tool for creating patterns or testing display devices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_ColorBars node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_ColorBars node are mode, width, height, color_1, color_2, orientation, and bar_frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'orientation' parameter in the CR_ColorBars node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'orientation' parameter determines the direction in which the color bars are arranged. It is a basic setting that dictates the layout of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'bar_frequency' parameter affect the output of the CR_ColorBars node?",
        "answer": "The 'bar_frequency' parameter controls the frequency of the color bars. It is an important factor in determining the density and spacing of the bars in the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'offset' parameter in the CR_ColorBars node?",
        "answer": "The 'offset' parameter adjusts the starting position of the color bars, allowing for fine-tuning the alignment of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_ColorBars node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_ColorBars node produces two output types: IMAGE, which provides the color bar pattern as the generated image, and show_help, which provides a link to the documentation for further help and guidance on using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for running the CR_ColorBars node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CR_ColorBars node is CPU."
