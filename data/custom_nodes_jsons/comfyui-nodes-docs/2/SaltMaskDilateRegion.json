        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskDilateRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskDilateRegion node applies a dilation filter to mask regions, effectively expanding the areas of interest in the mask based on the specified number of iterations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node are 'masks' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'iterations' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'iterations' parameter control in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter specifies the number of times the dilation operation is applied to the mask, controlling the extent of dilation and affecting the size and visibility of features within the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is 'MASKS' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), representing the masks after the dilation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltMaskDilateRegion node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskDilateRegion node is located in the '{NAME}/Masking/Filter' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'iterations' parameter in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'iterations' parameter in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is 5."
