    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter affect the operation of the LoadImgFromDirectoryBasedOnIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to determine the index of the image file to be loaded from the sorted file list. It affects the selection process by introducing a degree of randomness in the image retrieval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output of the LoadImgFromDirectoryBasedOnIndex node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output provides the loaded image in tensor format, which is essential for downstream tasks that require image data in numerical form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'filename' output in the LoadImgFromDirectoryBasedOnIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename' output returns the name of the loaded image file, which is useful for logging, tracking, or additional processing that requires file identification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the LoadImgFromDirectoryBasedOnIndex node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LoadImgFromDirectoryBasedOnIndex node is CPU."
