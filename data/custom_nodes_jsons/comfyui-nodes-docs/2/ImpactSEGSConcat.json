        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSConcat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSConcat node in ComfyUI is designed to merge multiple segmentations (SEGS) into a single unified segmentation. It efficiently combines segmentation data, ensuring that the resulting segmentation is coherent and maintains the integrity of the original data shapes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'segs1' parameter in the SEGSConcat node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs1' parameter in the SEGSConcat node is the set of segmentations to be concatenated. It plays a key role in defining the input data for the node, which will be merged into a single segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'segs1' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'segs1' parameter uses the 'SEGS' data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'output' parameter in the SEGSConcat node?",
        "answer": "The 'output' parameter in the SEGSConcat node represents the concatenated segmentation produced by the merging process. It is important as it is the main output of the node, containing the merged segmentation data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'output' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'output' parameter uses the 'SEGS' data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SEGSConcat node use?",
        "answer": "The SEGSConcat node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the source shapes of 'segs1' and another segmentation are different in the SEGSConcat node?",
        "answer": "If the source shapes of 'segs1' and another segmentation are different in the SEGSConcat node, an error message is printed, and the segmentation with the different shape is ignored."
