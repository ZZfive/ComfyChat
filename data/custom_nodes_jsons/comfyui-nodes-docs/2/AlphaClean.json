        "question": "What is the purpose of the AlphaClean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AlphaClean node in ComfyUI is used for image preprocessing, specifically enhancing and cleaning the alpha channel of images using techniques like bilateral filtering, Gaussian blur, and dynamic thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AlphaClean node are: images (torch.Tensor), radius (int), fill_holes (int), white_threshold (float), and extra_clip (float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the radius parameter affect the AlphaClean node's processing?",
        "answer": "The radius parameter specifies the radius of the Gaussian blur, influencing the smoothness of the edges in the alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fill_holes parameter control in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The fill_holes parameter determines whether and to what extent holes in the alpha channel are filled, improving the integrity of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the white_threshold parameter used in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The white_threshold parameter sets the threshold for considering a pixel as white, helping to separate the foreground from the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the extra_clip parameter in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The extra_clip parameter applies an additional clipping factor to the image, adjusting the strength of the cleaning effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AlphaClean node is an image (torch.Tensor) with a cleaned and enhanced alpha channel, ready for further use or display."
