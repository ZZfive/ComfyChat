        "question": "What is the purpose of the MixColorByMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MixColorByMask node in ComfyUI is designed to mix an input image with a solid color based on a provided mask. It adjusts the color channels of the image to specified RGB values and selectively combines the original image with the new color layer using the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MixColorByMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MixColorByMask node are 'image' (the input image to be operated on), 'r' (red channel intensity), 'g' (green channel intensity), 'b' (blue channel intensity), and 'mask' (a binary image indicating which parts of the input image will receive the color overlay)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask' parameter influence the output of the MixColorByMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is a binary image that controls which areas of the input image will be affected by the color mixing. The pattern of the mask determines the regions where the new color will be visible on the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MixColorByMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MixColorByMask node is 'output_image', which represents the result of the color mixing process. It is the final visual result of the node operation, showing the creative color application to specific areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the MixColorByMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the MixColorByMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MixColorByMask node combine the input image with the specified color?",
        "answer": "The MixColorByMask node combines the input image with the specified color by adjusting the color channels according to the provided RGB values and then selectively combining the original image with the new color layer using the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'r', 'g', and 'b' parameters in the MixColorByMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'r', 'g', and 'b' parameters in the MixColorByMask node specify the intensities of the red, green, and blue channels of the color to be mixed with the input image. These parameters are crucial for determining the final color that will overlay the image based on the mask."
