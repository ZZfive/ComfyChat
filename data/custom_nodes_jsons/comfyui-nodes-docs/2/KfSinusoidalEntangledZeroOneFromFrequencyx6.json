    {
        "question": "What is the role of the frequency parameter in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node?",
        "answer": "The frequency parameter determines the oscillation speed of the sinusoidal curves, influencing the overall rhythm and periodicity of the generated waveforms. It is crucial for defining the temporal characteristics of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the frequency parameter in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the frequency parameter is float in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node contains six sinusoidal curves, each representing a unique phase-shifted interpretation of the input frequency. These curves are the core of the node's functionality, providing a rich dataset for further analysis or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the output data type is COMBO[kf.SinusoidalCurve], while in Python, it is List[kf.SinusoidalCurve]."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node requires a CPU infra type for execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node generate the six entangled sinusoidal curves?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx6 node generates the six entangled sinusoidal curves by calling the main method of its superclass, KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequency, with the parameters n=6 and the provided frequency."
