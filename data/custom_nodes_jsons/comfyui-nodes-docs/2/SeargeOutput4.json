        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeOutput4 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput4 node is designed to facilitate the separation and identification of various model components in complex systems. It takes structured model names as input, deconstructs them, and provides separate access to each model type, enhancing the modularity and organization of output data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SeargeOutput4 node is 'model_names', which contains the names of all the models needed for the node to operate. It is a compound structure that holds the names of different models, each playing a different role in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput4 node outputs 'model_names', 'base_model', 'refiner_model', 'vae_model', 'main_upscale_model', 'support_upscale_model', and 'lora_model'. These outputs provide a clear and organized representation of the model names, facilitating further processing and analysis by other components in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'base_model' output represent in the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_model' output represents the base model in the system, which provides the foundation for other models and processes. Identifying it is crucial for understanding the structure and hierarchy of the models involved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'refiner_model' output in the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'refiner_model' output indicates a model that aims to enhance or improve the output of the base model. It plays a key role in increasing the overall accuracy and quality of the system results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'lora_model' output in the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_model' output is associated with the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model, a technique for efficiently adapting pre-trained models to new tasks. It is significant for its ability to improve model performance with minimal computational overhead."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the SeargeOutput4 node is CPU."
