        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is designed to preprocess images by applying a combination of Scribble and XDoG (Extended Difference of Gaussians) techniques to extract stylized line drawings. It belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors category and aims to enhance image analysis and processing tasks by emphasizing key outlines and features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is an image, which is the main data source for the line extraction process. The node will apply Scribble and XDoG techniques to this image to highlight and stylize important features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter control in the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter defines the intensity threshold for the XDoG filter, affecting the contrast and visibility of the extracted lines. It allows fine-tuning of the line extraction to achieve the desired artistic effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resolution' parameter specify in the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter specifies the resolution of the output image. It determines the level of detail and quality of the processed image, ensuring that the extracted lines are appropriately scaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is an image processed using Scribble and XDoG techniques, containing stylized extracted lines. It highlights the basic features and outlines, suitable for further image analysis or artistic applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the Inference_Core_Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node implemented in the provided source code?",
        "answer": "In the provided source code, the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is implemented using the ScribbleXDog_Detector model from the controlnet_aux.scribble module. The node takes an input image, threshold value, and resolution, and returns the processed image using the common_annotator_call function."
