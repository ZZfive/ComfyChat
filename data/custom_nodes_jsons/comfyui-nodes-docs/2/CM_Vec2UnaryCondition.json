        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec2UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec2UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various unary operations on 2D vectors. It applies the specified condition to each element of the vector and returns a boolean result indicating the outcome of the operation for each element."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Vec2UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Vec2UnaryCondition node are 'op' and 'a'. 'op' defines the unary condition to be applied to the vector elements, and 'a' represents the 2D vector on which the unary condition will be evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the Vec2UnaryCondition node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec2UnaryCondition node specifies the unary condition that will be applied to the vector elements. It is crucial for determining the nature of the operation and the expected result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter in the Vec2UnaryCondition node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec2UnaryCondition node represents the 2D vector on which the unary condition will be evaluated. It is essential for the node's execution as it provides the input data for the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Vec2UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Vec2UnaryCondition node is a tuple of boolean values, corresponding to the evaluation of the unary condition on each element of the input vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Vec2UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Vec2UnaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Vec2UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The category of the Vec2UnaryCondition node is 'math/vec2'."
