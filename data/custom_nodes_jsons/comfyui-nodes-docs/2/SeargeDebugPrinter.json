        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeDebugPrinter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeDebugPrinter node in ComfyUI is designed to provide detailed and formatted output of data structures to assist in the debugging process by allowing visual inspection of the contents of the data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'enabled' parameter in the SeargeDebugPrinter node?",
        "answer": "The 'enabled' parameter is crucial for activating the debugging process. When set to true, it triggers the node to output the structure and content of the data flow, facilitating a thorough examination of the data being processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'data' parameter represent in the SeargeDebugPrinter node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter represents the data stream to be inspected and formatted for debugging purposes. It is the core input that determines the content and structure of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'prefix' parameter enhance the output of the SeargeDebugPrinter node?",
        "answer": "The 'prefix' parameter is used to add a string at the beginning of each line of output, enhancing the readability and organization of the debugging information. It helps distinguish between different data points and trace the source of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the SeargeDebugPrinter node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the SeargeDebugPrinter node represents the original input data stream, now accompanied by a detailed and formatted representation of its structure and content, providing a reference for further analysis and debugging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the SeargeDebugPrinter node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the SeargeDebugPrinter node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeDebugPrinter node handle different data types within the data stream?",
        "answer": "The SeargeDebugPrinter node uses specific methods like `print_dict`, `print_coll`, and `print_val` to handle different data types such as dictionaries, lists, and tuples within the data stream, ensuring that the output is formatted according to the type of data being processed."
