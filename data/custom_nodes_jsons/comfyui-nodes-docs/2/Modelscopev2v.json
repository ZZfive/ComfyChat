    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the model_path parameter in the Modelscopev2v node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the model_path parameter in the Modelscopev2v node is 'cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Modelscopev2v node optimize memory usage during the transformation process?",
        "answer": "The Modelscopev2v node optimizes memory usage by enabling forward chunking and VAE slicing based on the provided toggles enable_forward_chunking and enable_vae_slicing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Modelscopev2v node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Modelscopev2v node is an IMAGE, representing the transformed video frames after the specified visual content transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the node convert the transformed video frames to the required output format?",
        "answer": "The node converts the transformed video frames to the required output format by ensuring they are a PyTorch tensor, normalizing the tensor values between 0 and 1 if needed, and converting the tensor to CPU."
