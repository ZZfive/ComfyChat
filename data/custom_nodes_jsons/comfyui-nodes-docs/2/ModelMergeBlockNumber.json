        "question": "What is the purpose of the ModelMergeBlockNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ModelMergeBlockNumber node is designed to merge multiple models into a single, cohesive structure by combining specified blocks from two input models, ensuring that the resulting model retains the functionality and performance of its constituent parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ModelMergeBlockNumber node are 'model1' and 'model2', representing the first and second models to be merged, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'time_embed.' parameter do in the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'time_embed.' parameter is used to embed time-related information into the model, which is particularly important for models that require temporal context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'input_blocks' parameters in the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_blocks.i.' parameters, where 'i' ranges from 0 to 11, represent blocks in the input layer of the model. These blocks are crucial for processing input data and preparing it for further stages of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'middle_block' parameters affect the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'middle_block.i.' parameters, with 'i' ranging from 0 to 2, correspond to blocks in the middle layer of the model. These blocks are essential for the model's intermediate processing steps, influencing how the model transforms and utilizes input data before the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'output_blocks' parameters in the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_blocks.i.' parameters, where 'i' ranges from 0 to 11, define the configuration of the output layer blocks. These blocks are responsible for converting the model's internal representation into the desired output format, and their settings are crucial for the model to produce accurate and meaningful results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'out.' parameter specify in the ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'out.' parameter specifies the final output configuration of the model, determining the structure of the model's predictions or outputs. Setting this parameter correctly ensures that the model's output aligns with the expected format and requirements."
