        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadImageInspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadImageInspire node in ComfyUI is used to load and preprocess images, converting them into a format suitable for further analysis and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LoadImageInspire node?",
        "answer": "The LoadImageInspire node outputs two tensors: the processed image tensor and a mask tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LoadImageInspire node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LoadImageInspire node are 'image' and 'image_data'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' output represent in the LoadImageInspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output in the LoadImageInspire node provides a binary representation that can be used for various image-related operations, enhancing the versatility of the node's applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for running the LoadImageInspire node?",
        "answer": "The LoadImageInspire node requires a CPU infrastructure type for execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadImageInspire node handle images with transparency?",
        "answer": "If the input image contains an alpha channel ('A' in the image bands), the LoadImageInspire node creates a mask based on the alpha channel data. Otherwise, it creates a mask filled with zeros."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'image_data' parameter in the LoadImageInspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_data' parameter in the LoadImageInspire node contains the encoded image data, which is essential for the node to perform its main function of loading and converting the image."
