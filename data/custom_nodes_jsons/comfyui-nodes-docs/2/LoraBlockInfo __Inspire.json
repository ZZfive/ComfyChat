        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoraBlockInfo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoraBlockInfo node in ComfyUI is designed to extract and convey detailed information about specific LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) blocks within a model. It utilizes LoRA technology to adjust model parameters for improved performance on specific tasks and provides insights into these modifications and their impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LoraBlockInfo node are: model (the deep learning model to which LoRA adaptation is applied), clip (the CLIP model used alongside the main model), lora_name (the filename containing the LoRA adaptation to be loaded and analyzed), and block_info (a string containing detailed information about the specific block within the model modified using LoRA)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "In the LoraBlockInfo node, the 'model' parameter represents the deep learning model to which LoRA adaptation is applied. It is crucial for identifying the specific blocks within the model that have been modified using LoRA technology."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoraBlockInfo node extract and present information about LoRA adaptations?",
        "answer": "The LoraBlockInfo node extracts information about LoRA adaptations by analyzing the loaded LoRA file and the specified model and CLIP. It then presents this information in a structured format, detailing the number of input, middle, output, and text blocks, as well as any base blocks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'lora_name' parameter in the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' parameter in the LoraBlockInfo node specifies the filename containing the LoRA adaptation to be loaded and analyzed. It is essential for locating and applying the correct LoRA modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the LoraBlockInfo node have any output types?",
        "answer": "No, the LoraBlockInfo node does not have any output types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the LoraBlockInfo node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LoraBlockInfo node is CPU."
