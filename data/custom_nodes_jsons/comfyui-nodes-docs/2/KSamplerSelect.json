        "question": "What is the purpose of the KSamplerSelect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerSelect node in ComfyUI is designed to provide a selection mechanism for different sampling methods during the diffusion process. It abstracts away the complexity of selecting and initializing various samplers, allowing users to focus on high-level sampling tasks without delving into the specifics of each sampler's initialization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KSamplerSelect node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KSamplerSelect node is 'sampler_name', which is crucial for determining the sampling method to be used. It guides the node to select the appropriate sampler based on the provided name, which is essential for the execution of the sampling process and the resulting outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KSamplerSelect node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KSamplerSelect node is 'SAMPLER', which represents the selected sampling method. It encapsulates the functionality of the chosen sampler, which is significant for carrying out the sampling process and achieving the desired results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the KSamplerSelect node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the KSamplerSelect node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the KSamplerSelect node classified?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerSelect node is classified under the 'sampling/custom_sampling/samplers' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used in the source code of the KSamplerSelect node?",
        "answer": "The function used in the source code of the KSamplerSelect node is 'get_sampler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'get_sampler' function in the KSamplerSelect node do?",
        "answer": "The 'get_sampler' function in the KSamplerSelect node initializes and returns the sampler object based on the provided 'sampler_name'."
