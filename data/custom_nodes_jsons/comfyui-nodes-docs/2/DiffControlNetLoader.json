        "question": "What is the purpose of the DiffControlNetLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DiffControlNetLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load control nets into a given model framework, abstracting the complexity of locating and integrating control networks to ensure seamless enhancement of models through control mechanisms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DiffControlNetLoader node are 'model' and 'control_net_name'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in the DiffControlNetLoader node is crucial as it represents the framework into which the control network will be integrated. It is the foundational element through which the control network interacts with the model's existing architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'control_net_name' parameter specify in the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net_name' parameter in the DiffControlNetLoader node specifies the unique identifier of the control network to be loaded. It is vital for the node's operation as it guides the retrieval and application of the correct control network configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DiffControlNetLoader node is 'CONTROL_NET', which represents the loaded control network ready to be integrated with the provided model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'CONTROL_NET' output represent in the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'CONTROL_NET' output in the DiffControlNetLoader node encapsulates the control mechanism that will be applied to enhance the functionality of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the DiffControlNetLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the DiffControlNetLoader node is CPU."
