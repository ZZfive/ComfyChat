        "question": "What class name is associated with the GradientOverlay node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the GradientOverlay node is 'GradientOverlay'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the GradientOverlay node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GradientOverlay node falls under the ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerStyle category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "When is the 'invert_mask' parameter needed in the client?",
        "answer": "The 'invert_mask' parameter is needed when a layer image has its own mask and it is to be blended with the background image using the inverse of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'opacity' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'opacity' parameter is used to set the transparency of the resulting image. A value of 100 means fully opaque, and 0 means fully transparent."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'blend_mode' parameter used in the GradientOverlay extension?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_mode' parameter is used to determine the blending mode between the layer image and the generated gradient mask in the resulting image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the dimensions of the tensor representation of an image?",
        "answer": "The tensor representation of an image in ComfyUI has dimensions (B, C, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function responsible for overlaying gradients on background images?",
        "answer": "The function responsible for overlaying gradients on background images is 'gradient_overlay'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required for the 'gradient_overlay' function?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient-overlay' function requires inputs such as 'background_image', 'layer_image', 'invert_mask', 'blend_mode', 'opacity', 'start_color', 'start_alpha', 'end_color', 'end_alpha', and 'angle'. Optionally, it accepts 'layer_mask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'opacity' parameter in the gradient-overlay extension?",
        "answer": "The 'opacity' parameter can take integer values ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 is fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the result type of the 'gradient_overlay' function?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_overlay' function outputs an image tensor."
