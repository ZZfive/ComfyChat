        "question": "What is the purpose of the CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node in ComfyUI is designed to process settings for depth estimation using the MiDaS model, encapsulating the configuration into a format suitable for further processing or application in a pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node requires a 'midas_settings' input, which specifies the configuration for depth estimation, including source, strength, start, end, and additional parameters that collectively determine how depth estimation is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'midas_settings' input in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the 'midas_settings' input is a tuple of integers and floats, represented as Tuple[int, float, float, float, float, float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node outputs six values: 'midas_source' (int), 'midas_strength' (float), 'midas_start' (float), 'midas_end' (float), 'midas_a' (float), and 'midas_bg' (float), which are used to control various aspects of the depth estimation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'midas_source' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'midas_source' output identifies the source image used for depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'midas_strength' output affect the depth estimation?",
        "answer": "The 'midas_strength' output specifies the strength of the depth effect in the estimation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CtrlNet MiDaS Pipe node is CPU."
