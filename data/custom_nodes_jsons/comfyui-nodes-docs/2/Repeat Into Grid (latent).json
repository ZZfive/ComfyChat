        "question": "What is the purpose of the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node in ComfyUI is used to tile input latent samples into a grid of configurable dimensions, effectively creating a larger grid-like structure by repeating the samples over a specified number of rows and columns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node are: samples (latent samples to be tiled into the grid), columns (number of columns in the grid), and rows (number of rows in the grid)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'columns' input specify in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The 'columns' input in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node specifies the number of columns in the grid, which affects how many times the samples are repeated horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rows' input specify in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The 'rows' input in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node specifies the number of rows in the grid, which affects how many times the samples are repeated vertically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node is latent, which represents a grid of latent samples arranged according to the specified number of rows and columns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node create the grid-like structure?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node creates the grid-like structure by repeating the input samples over the specified number of rows and columns using the `repeat()` function in its source code."
