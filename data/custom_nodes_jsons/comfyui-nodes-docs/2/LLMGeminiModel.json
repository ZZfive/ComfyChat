    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMGeminiModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMGeminiModel node are 'model_name', which specifies the name of the Gemini model to load, and 'api_key', which is the API key required to access the Gemini model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model_name' input specify in the LLMGeminiModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' input in the LLMGeminiModel node specifies the name of the Gemini model to load, determining the capabilities and characteristics of the language model to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'api_key' input in the LLMGeminiModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'api_key' input in the LLMGeminiModel node is essential for authentication and authorization when using the Gemini model."
