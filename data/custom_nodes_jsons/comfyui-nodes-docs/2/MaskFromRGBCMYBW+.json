        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node in ComfyUI is designed to generate masks based on specific RGB, CMY, and BW values in an image. It simplifies color space conversion and thresholding operations, providing users with an intuitive way to create masks that highlight or isolate specific color ranges or intensity levels within an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node are: 'image' (the input image from which the mask will be generated), 'threshold_r' (the red component threshold), 'threshold_g' (the green component threshold), 'threshold_b' (the blue component threshold), 'remove_isolated_pixels' (whether to remove isolated pixels from the generated mask), and 'fill_holes' (whether to fill holes in the generated mask)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'remove_isolated_pixels' parameter do in the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'remove_isolated_pixels' parameter in the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node determines whether to remove isolated pixels from the generated mask, enhancing the mask's clarity and relevance to the target color or intensity level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fill_holes' parameter do in the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'fill_holes' parameter in the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node indicates whether to fill holes in the generated mask, ensuring a more continuous and useful mask for further image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node are 'red' (output mask isolating the red component), 'green' (output mask isolating the green component), 'blue' (output mask isolating the blue component), 'cyan' (output mask isolating the cyan component), 'magenta' (output mask isolating the magenta component), 'yellow' (output mask isolating the yellow component), 'black' (output mask isolating the black component), and 'white' (output mask isolating the white component)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used in the source code for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the MaskFromRGBCMYBW+ node is written in Python."
