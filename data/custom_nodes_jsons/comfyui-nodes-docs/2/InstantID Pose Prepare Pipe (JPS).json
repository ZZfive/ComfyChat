        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node is used to prepare image settings for pose estimation in the instant ID generation process. It handles various image preparation parameters such as resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation to optimize the image for subsequent pose analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node is 'imageprepare_settings', which specifies the settings for preparing the image, including resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation. This is essential for optimizing the image for pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resize_to' output type represent in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'resize_to' output type represents the target size to which the image should be resized in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'offset_width' and 'offset_height' output types in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'offset_width' and 'offset_height' output types represent the width and height offsets that should be applied to the image in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'crop_left', 'crop_right', 'crop_top', and 'crop_bottom' output types represent in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_left', 'crop_right', 'crop_top', and 'crop_bottom' output types represent the amount to be cropped from the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively, in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'padding_left', 'padding_right', 'padding_top', and 'padding_bottom' output types in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'padding_left', 'padding_right', 'padding_top', and 'padding_bottom' output types represent the amount of padding to be added to the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively, in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interpolation' output type specify in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' output type specifies the interpolation method to be used for resizing the image in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node. The available options are 'lanczos', 'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'area', and 'nearest-exact'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sharpening' output type in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpening' output type represents the degree of sharpening to be applied to the image in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'flip' output type specify in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'flip' output type specifies whether the image should be flipped and along which axis the flipping should occur in the InstantID Pose Prepare Pipe node. The available options are 'No', 'X-Axis', and 'Y-Axis'."
