        "question": "What is the purpose of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node in ComfyUI applies the GrabCut algorithm with framing options to segment the foreground from the background in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node are: image, thresh_maybe, thresh_sure, iterations, margin, frame_option, binary_threshold, maybe_black_is_sure_background, and output_format."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_option' parameter affect the GrabCut algorithm in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_option' parameter in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node specifies which image edges to exclude from the foreground or background consideration, allowing for finer control over the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'binary_threshold' parameter do in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'binary_threshold' parameter in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node is used to differentiate between probable foreground and background in the 'thresh_maybe' and 'thresh_sure' images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node is an image (numpy.ndarray) that has been segmented using the GrabCut algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node use?",
        "answer": "The Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is the source code of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node written in?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node is written in Python."
