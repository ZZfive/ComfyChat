        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node is designed to extract and provide the dimensions of an image, focusing on width and height as key attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the imageSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the imageSize node is an image, which is essential for deriving the width and height values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the imageSize node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the imageSize node are width_int, representing the horizontal dimension of the input image, and height_int, representing the vertical dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the width_int output in the imageSize node?",
        "answer": "The width_int output in the imageSize node provides crucial information about the horizontal dimension of the input image, facilitating further image-related operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the height_int output in the imageSize node represent?",
        "answer": "The height_int output in the imageSize node represents the vertical dimension of the input image, which is essential for understanding the image's structure and subsequent image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the imageSize node use?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the imageSize node determine the width and height of an image?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node determines the width and height of an image by extracting the shape of the input image and assigning the corresponding dimensions to the variables width and height."
