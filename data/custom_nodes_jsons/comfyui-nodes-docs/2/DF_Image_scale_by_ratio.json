        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node is to enlarge images by a specified ratio, apply selected enlargement methods, and optionally crop the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node are: image (the image to be enlarged), upscale_by (the factor by which the image size should be increased), upscale_method (the method used for enlarging the image), and crop (whether and how to crop the enlarged image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the upscale_by input determine in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The upscale_by input determines the factor by which the image size should be increased, directly affecting the final size of the enlarged image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the upscale_method input affect the image in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The upscale_method input affects the quality and characteristics of the enlarged image, as different methods are used for enlarging the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the crop input in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The crop input determines whether and how to crop the enlarged image, affecting the final composition and aspect ratio of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node is an image, which is the enlarged version of the input image, possibly cropped according to the specified method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node is GPU."
