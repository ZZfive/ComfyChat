        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchAverageImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageImage node in ComfyUI is used to perform statistical averaging operations, such as calculating the mean or median, on a batch of images. It aims to create a single representative image from a group of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the BatchAverageImage node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the BatchAverageImage node are: 1. images - the collection of images to be processed, and 2. operation - the type of averaging operation to be applied, such as 'mean' or 'median'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BatchAverageImage node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BatchAverageImage node is an image that represents the statistical summary of the input batch of images after applying the specified averaging operation."
