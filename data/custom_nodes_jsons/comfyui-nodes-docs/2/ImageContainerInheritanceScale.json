        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageContainerInheritanceScale node is designed to adjust the size of an image based on specified width and height scale factors. It not only resizes the input image but also applies additional image processing operations like color adjustments through subsequent nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node include: images (the input image to be scaled), scale_width (the scale factor for the width of the input image), scale_height (the scale factor for the height of the input image), red (the red component to be applied to the image), green (the green component to be applied to the image), blue (the blue component to be applied to the image), alpha (the alpha or transparency value to be applied to the image), and method (the method used for scaling and applying color adjustments)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node affect the color balance of the output image?",
        "answer": "The ImageContainerInheritanceScale node affects the color balance of the output image by applying specified red, green, and blue components. These values influence the overall color balance of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the alpha input parameter control in the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node?",
        "answer": "The alpha input parameter in the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node controls the transparency or opacity of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node is an image or a set of images that have been scaled and color-adjusted according to the specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageContainerInheritanceScale node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageContainerInheritanceScale node relate to the ImageContainerInheritanceAdd node in its operation?",
        "answer": "The ImageContainerInheritanceScale node uses the ImageContainerInheritanceAdd node in its operation. It returns the result of calling the node function of ImageContainerInheritanceAdd with the same parameters."
