        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the ImpactValueReceiver node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the ImpactValueReceiver node is to process and convert input values according to a specified type, ensuring the correct data format for seamless integration and operation within the ImpactPack framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'typ' parameter in the ImpactValueReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The 'typ' parameter indicates which type of conversion the 'doit' method will perform on the input 'value'. It is crucial for the node's execution as it determines how the input data will be processed and converted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'value' parameter in the ImpactValueReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter represents the data that will be converted by the 'doit' method. Correct input is essential for the node to produce the expected output as it directly impacts the operation of the node and the resulting output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'link_id' parameter in the ImpactValueReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The 'link_id' parameter serves as an optional identifier for the connection in the system. It can be used for tracking or referencing specific data points and aids in the overall organization and management of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'converted_value' represent in the ImpactValueReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'converted_value' represents the result of the conversion process performed by the 'doit' method. It is significant as it reflects the node's ability to accurately convert input data according to the specified type, ensuring the integrity and usability of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactValueReceiver node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactValueReceiver node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'doit' method in the ImpactValueReceiver node do?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method in the ImpactValueReceiver node processes and converts the input 'value' according to the specified 'typ'. Depending on the value of 'typ', it returns the converted value as either an integer, float, boolean, or string."
