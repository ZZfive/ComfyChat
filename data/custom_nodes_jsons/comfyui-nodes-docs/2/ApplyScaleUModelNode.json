        "question": "What is the purpose of the ApplyScaleUModelNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the ApplyScaleUModelNode is to enhance the functionality of a given model by applying the ScaleU patch, which adjusts the model's output based on ScaleU technology."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ApplyScaleUModelNode are 'model', which is the model to which the ScaleU patch will be applied, and 'scaleu', which is the ScaleU configuration to be applied to the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scaleu' input parameter define in the ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The 'scaleu' input parameter defines the specific scaling adjustments and enhancements that will be made to the model, affecting its performance and output characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ApplyScaleUModelNode is 'model', which represents the enhanced model after the ScaleU patch has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ApplyScaleUModelNode represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ApplyScaleUModelNode represents the modified model, reflecting the improvements or adjustments made after applying the ScaleU technology."
