        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskGradientRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGradientRegion node is used to apply a gradient filter to mask regions, enhancing edges and transition areas within the mask to highlight areas of change."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltMaskGradientRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltMaskGradientRegion node is 'masks', which represents the mask regions to which the gradient filter will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'kernel_size' parameter in the SaltMaskGradientRegion node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_size' parameter specifies the size of the kernel used in the morphological gradient operation, affecting the degree of edge enhancement and transition emphasis in the mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskGradientRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskGradientRegion node is MASKS, which is the result of applying the gradient filter to the input mask regions, characterized by enhanced edges and transition areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infratype does the SaltMaskGradientRegion node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGradientRegion node uses the 'GPU' infratype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltMaskGradientRegion node apply the gradient filter to the input masks?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGradientRegion node applies the gradient filter to the input masks by converting each mask to a grayscale image, applying the morphological gradient operation using the specified kernel size, and then converting the result back to a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'kernel_size' parameter in the SaltMaskGradientRegion node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'kernel_size' parameter in the SaltMaskGradientRegion node is 3."
