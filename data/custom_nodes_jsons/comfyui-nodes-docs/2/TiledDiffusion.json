        "question": "What is the purpose of the TiledDiffusion class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TiledDiffusion class in ComfyUI is a framework for applying diffusion models in a tiled manner by segmenting large images into smaller fragments to enhance processing. This method improves computational efficiency and allows for finer-grained control over the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the TiledDiffusion class?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial because it defines the diffusion model to be used within the node. It is the core component that controls the behavior and output of the TiledDiffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'method' parameter influence the TiledDiffusion process?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter determines the specific diffusion technique to be used, affecting the overall performance and quality of the output. It is a key factor in adjusting the functionality of the node to suit desired results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'tile_batch_size' parameter play in the TiledDiffusion process?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_batch_size' parameter specifies the number of tiles to be processed in each batch, which is crucial for managing memory usage and accelerating the diffusion process. It directly affects the trade-off between computational resources and processing speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TiledDiffusion class handle the output model?",
        "answer": "The output model from the TiledDiffusion class is a modified version of the input model, now equipped with tiled diffusion capabilities. It embodies the result of the node's processing, encapsulating the enhanced ability to handle large images through the diffusion method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the TiledDiffusion class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the TiledDiffusion class is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two diffusion techniques available in the 'method' parameter of the TiledDiffusion class?",
        "answer": "The two diffusion techniques available in the 'method' parameter of the TiledDiffusion class are 'MultiDiffusion' and 'Mixture of Diffusers'."
