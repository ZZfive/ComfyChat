        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node is used to apply image processing adjustments based on encoded masks within the InspirePack framework. It allows for conditional modification of image embeddings based on specified masks and weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node are: mask, embeds, weight, weight_type, start_at, end_at, and unfold_batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' input specify in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input specifies the areas of the image that require conditional embedding adjustments. It plays a key role in defining the regions of focus for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'weight' input in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' input determines the strength of the embedding adjustments applied to the image. It allows for fine-tuning the intensity of the effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight_type' input specify in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_type' input specifies the method of applying the weight to the embeddings, providing options such as original, linear, or channel penalty for diverse adjustment effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs in the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs define the starting and ending points of the effect application in the image processing, allowing for precise control over the range of adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask node is 'neg_embeds', which can be used to specify features or adjustments to avoid in specific regions, adding the capability for reverse effects."
