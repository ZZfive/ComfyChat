        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemoveImageFromSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemoveImageFromSEGS node is designed to process segmentation data by removing the original image component from the 'SEGS' object, allowing for a simplified version of the segmentation data that does not include the image itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the essential attributes retained by the RemoveImageFromSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The RemoveImageFromSEGS node retains essential attributes such as the cropped mask, confidence, crop region, bounding box, label, and control net wrapper."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the RemoveImageFromSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the RemoveImageFromSEGS node is 'segs', which represents the segmentation data that needs to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'segs' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'segs' input parameter is SEGS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'segs' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'segs' input parameter is Tuple[SEG, List[SEG]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output of the RemoveImageFromSEGS node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output contains the processed 'SEGS' object with the original image removed, providing users with a modified segmentation dataset that eliminates unnecessary image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the RemoveImageFromSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the RemoveImageFromSEGS node is CPU."
