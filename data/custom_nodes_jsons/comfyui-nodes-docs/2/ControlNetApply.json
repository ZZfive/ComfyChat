        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'apply_controlnet' method in the ControlNetApply class?",
        "answer": "The 'apply_controlnet' method in the ControlNetApply class is designed to integrate control signals into the processing flow of a neural network. It takes conditioning data, a control network, an image, and a strength parameter to modulate the influence of the control network on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning' parameter in the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it provides the initial state or context for the control network to apply its modifications. It directly influences the outcome of the image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'control_net' parameter define in the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net' parameter defines the network that will be used to guide the modifications to the image. It is a required input and plays a core role in shaping the final output of the node's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'image' parameter in the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is the object that the control network will modify. It represents the data that will be enhanced or altered based on the provided control signals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter adjust in the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter adjusts the intensity of the control network's influence on the image. It is an optional input that allows for fine-tuning the degree of modifications applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'conditioning' represent in the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The output 'conditioning' represents the modified state after applying the influence of the control network. It is significant as it carries the final adjustments made to the original image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is required for the ControlNetApply node?",
        "answer": "The required infra type for the ControlNetApply node is GPU."
