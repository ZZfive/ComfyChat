        "question": "What is the purpose of the IsMaskEmptyNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IsMaskEmptyNode class is designed to evaluate the internal content of a mask tensor to determine if it is entirely composed of zero values. It plays a key role in image processing and machine learning workflows where the presence of an empty mask is significant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the IsMaskEmptyNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the IsMaskEmptyNode is 'mask', which is a tensor representing the mask to be evaluated. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it directly influences whether the mask is considered empty or not."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IsMaskEmptyNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IsMaskEmptyNode is 'boolean_number', which is a numeric representation of a boolean value indicating whether the input mask is empty. A value of 1 indicates that the mask is empty (all zeros), while a value of 0 indicates that the mask contains non-zero elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the IsMaskEmptyNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the IsMaskEmptyNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the IsMaskEmptyNode?",
        "answer": "The category of the IsMaskEmptyNode is 'util'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the IsMaskEmptyNode an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the IsMaskEmptyNode is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the IsMaskEmptyNode's main function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the IsMaskEmptyNode's main function is a tuple containing an integer, which represents whether the input mask is empty (1 for empty, 0 for not empty)."
