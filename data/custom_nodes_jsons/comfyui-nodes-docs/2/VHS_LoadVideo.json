        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the LoadVideoUpload node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the LoadVideoUpload node is to efficiently manage and process video files by loading videos from various sources, offering upsampling, and manipulating video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the 'video' parameter accept in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'video' parameter accepts a STRING data type, which can be either a local file path or a URL to an online video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the 'force_rate' parameter serve in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'force_rate' parameter in the LoadVideoUpload node allows users to adjust the frame rate of the video, ensuring consistency in frame rates across different videos, which is crucial for certain video processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'force_size' parameter in the LoadVideoUpload node contribute to video processing?",
        "answer": "The 'force_size' parameter in the LoadVideoUpload node specifies the desired resolution of the video frames. It provides several preset options and allows setting custom dimensions, which may be necessary to maintain aspect ratios or fit specific display requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'frame_load_cap' parameter in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_load_cap' parameter determines the maximum number of frames to be loaded from the video. It helps control memory usage and processing time, especially when dealing with long videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'skip_first_frames' parameter benefit video processing in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'skip_first_frames' parameter in the LoadVideoUpload node enables skipping a specified number of frames from the beginning of the video. This is useful for omitting unnecessary content or intro segments from the video processing workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'IMAGE' output provide in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'IMAGE' output in the LoadVideoUpload node provides video frames in the form of tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays suitable for further video analysis and processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'video_info' output contain in the LoadVideoUpload node?",
        "answer": "The 'video_info' output in the LoadVideoUpload node contains metadata about the video, such as frame rate, duration, and dimensions. This information is valuable for various video processing tasks that require knowledge of the video's characteristics."
