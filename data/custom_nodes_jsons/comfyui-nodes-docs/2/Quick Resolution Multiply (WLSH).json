        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Res_Multiply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Res_Multiply node is designed to perform multiplication operations on width and height values, scaling them according to the provided multiplier. It plays a crucial role in adjusting the dimensions of images or similar geometric entities, ensuring that the scaling factor is applied evenly to both dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WLSH_Res_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WLSH_Res_Multiply node are 'width', 'height', and 'multiplier'. 'width' represents the initial width of the entity to be scaled, 'height' represents the initial height of the entity, and 'multiplier' is the factor by which the width and height will be scaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiplier' parameter in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node is the factor by which the width and height of the entity will be scaled. It directly affects the magnitude of the scaling operation. Choosing an appropriate multiplier is crucial for achieving the desired dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WLSH_Res_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WLSH_Res_Multiply node are 'width' and 'height'. 'width' represents the scaled width of the entity after the multiplication operation, and 'height' represents the scaled height of the entity after the multiplication."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WLSH_Res_Multiply node use?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Res_Multiply node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'multiplier' parameter in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'multiplier' parameter in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node is 2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum value allowed for the 'width' and 'height' parameters in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value allowed for both the 'width' and 'height' parameters in the WLSH_Res_Multiply node is 16."
