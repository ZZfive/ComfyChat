        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_RandomRGBGradient node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_RandomRGBGradient node is used to generate random RGB gradients by creating a series of smoothly transitioning RGB values from one color to the next, ensuring visually appealing gradient effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' parameter do in the CR_RandomRGBGradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is crucial for the node's random number generation process. It ensures that the generated RGB values are reproducible, allowing consistent results across different runs, which is especially important in scenarios where the same gradient needs to be generated multiple times."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'rows' parameter affect the output of the CR_RandomRGBGradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'rows' parameter determines the number of color stops in the generated gradient. Higher values result in more detailed gradients with more intermediate colors, while lower values lead to simpler gradients with fewer color transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the format of the 'multiline_text' output in the CR_RandomRGBGradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiline_text' output contains the generated RGB gradient data in a multiline format, where each line represents a color stop in the gradient, with RGB values separated by commas. This format is convenient for use in various applications that require gradient data to be input line by line."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_RandomRGBGradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation page, which is helpful for users who need additional information or guidance on effectively using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the CR_RandomRGBGradient node?",
        "answer": "The CR_RandomRGBGradient node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for the CR_RandomRGBGradient node's source code?",
        "answer": "The source code for the CR_RandomRGBGradient node is written in Python."
