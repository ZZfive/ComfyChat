        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageTransformTranspose node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformTranspose node in ComfyUI abstracts complex image operation tasks, allowing various geometric transformations to be applied to a batch of images. This helps to easily integrate it into the image processing workflow, improving the flexibility and efficiency of image manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageTransformTranspose node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageTransformTranspose node are 'images' and 'method'. 'images' represents the batch of images to be transformed and is the key input data for node operations. 'method' determines the type of geometric transformation to be applied, affecting the processing and transformation results of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageTransformTranspose node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageTransformTranspose node is 'image', which represents the image after the geometric transformation, reflecting the effect of the applied transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageTransformTranspose node commonly use?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformTranspose node commonly uses the 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what does the 'transpose_tensor' function do?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'transpose_tensor' function applies the specified geometric transformation to the input tensor based on the 'method' parameter. It supports transformations such as flipping horizontally, flipping vertically, rotating 90/180/270 degrees, and transposing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'node' function in the ImageTransformTranspose class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'node' function in the ImageTransformTranspose class is a tuple containing a torch.Tensor, which represents the stack of transformed images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageTransformTranspose node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageTransformTranspose node is 'image/transform'."
