        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node are: 1) image - the sequence of images for which optical flow needs to be estimated, 2) ckpt_name - the checkpoint filename of the Unimatch model, 3) backward_flow - a boolean flag indicating whether to estimate backward optical flow, and 4) bidirectional_flow - a boolean flag indicating whether to estimate bidirectional optical flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ckpt_name input determine in the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The ckpt_name input in the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node determines the specific pre-trained model version to be used for flow estimation."

    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the backward_flow input to True in the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Setting the backward_flow input to True in the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node indicates that backward optical flow should be estimated, affecting the directionality of the flow estimate."

    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_Unimatch_OptFlowPreprocessor node includes two types: 1) OPTICAL_FLOW - the enhanced optical flow prediction processed by the Unimatch algorithm, providing fine motion estimates between video frames, and 2) PREVIEW_IMAGE - a visualization of the optical flow prediction, offering a visual representation of the inter-frame motion for interpretation and analysis."
