    {
        "question": "How does the threshold_percentile parameter influence the output in DynamicThresholdingComfyNode?",
        "answer": "The threshold_percentile parameter plays an important role in determining the variability of the generated content. It sets a threshold based on the percentile value to control the dynamic scaling of features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the mimic_mode parameter play in the DynamicThresholdingComfyNode?",
        "answer": "The mimic_mode parameter specifies the scaling mode in the thresholding process. It is key in defining how the model adapts to the input and accordingly adjusts its output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the cfg_mode parameter in DynamicThresholdingComfyNode?",
        "answer": "The cfg_mode parameter specifies the configuration mode of dynamic thresholds. It is essential in guiding the node on how to interpret and apply the scaling factors of feature adjustments."
