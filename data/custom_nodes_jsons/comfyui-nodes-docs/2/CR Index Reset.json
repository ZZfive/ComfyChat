        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the CR_IndexReset node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the CR_IndexReset node is to reset a given index to a specified value, ensuring continuity and correctness of index operations within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_IndexReset node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_IndexReset node are 'index' and 'reset_to', both of which are of the Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'index' parameter influence the execution of the CR_IndexReset node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter identifies the specific position or serial number that needs to be reset within a dataset or operation. It directly affects the execution of the node by determining which index will be reassigned to the 'reset_to' value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'reset_to' parameter play in the CR_IndexReset node?",
        "answer": "The 'reset_to' parameter defines the new starting point of the index after the reset operation. It is crucial for setting the correct initial value that 'index' will be assigned to after being reset, thereby influencing subsequent system behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the CR_IndexReset node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_IndexReset node produces three outputs: 'index', 'reset_to', and 'show_help'. 'index' reflects the updated index value after the reset operation, 'reset_to' is the value the index is reset to, and 'show_help' provides a URL link to documentation for further help or information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_IndexReset node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_IndexReset node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_IndexReset node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to documentation for further help or information about the node's operation. This is especially useful for users seeking additional guidance on how to effectively use the node."
