        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadImagePath node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadImagePath node is designed to retrieve and process image data from a specified path or URL. It can handle both online images (by downloading) and local images (by directly opening the file). The node is capable of converting the image into a format suitable for further processing, including normalization and conversion to a tensor, and if available, extracting a mask. This node is essential for initiating image-based operations in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LoadImagePath node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial as it defines the source of the image data. It can be a local file path or a URL pointing to an online image. The node uses this input to retrieve and process the image accordingly, making it a key element of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LoadImagePath node?",
        "answer": "The LoadImagePath node outputs two types of data: 'image' and 'mask'. The 'image' output is the processed version of the input image, converted into a tensor format suitable for further computational tasks. The 'mask' output, when present, provides additional information in the form of a binary mask derived from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'image' output in the LoadImagePath node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the LoadImagePath node is the key result of the node's functionality. It represents the processed version of the input image, converted into a tensor format that is suitable for further computational tasks, enabling subsequent image analysis and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'mask' output in the LoadImagePath node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output in the LoadImagePath node, when present, provides additional information in the form of a binary mask derived from the input image. This mask can be used for various purposes in image processing workflows, such as segmentation or object recognition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LoadImagePath node use?",
        "answer": "The LoadImagePath node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadImagePath node handle input images from URLs?",
        "answer": "When the input image path starts with 'http', indicating a URL, the LoadImagePath node downloads the image using the requests library. It then opens the downloaded content and converts it to RGB format for further processing."
