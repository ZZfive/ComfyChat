        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance high-frequency details in images while effectively removing low-frequency noise or blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node are 'images', which is the input image to be processed by the high-pass filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius' parameter affect the high-pass filtering process in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node determines the extent of blur to be removed by the high-pass filter, influencing the scale of details retained in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node controls the intensity of the high-pass filter effect. Higher values result in more pronounced enhancement of high-frequency details."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'color_output' parameter influence the output of the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_output' parameter in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node specifies whether the output should be in color (RGB) or grayscale (L), affecting the visual appearance of the filtered image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'neutral_background' parameter in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'neutral_background' parameter in the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node determines whether a neutral color background should be added to the image, which can be helpful when a neutral backdrop is needed for better visual contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_High_Pass_Filter node is the 'images' parameter, which contains the processed images with enhanced high-frequency details and reduced low-frequency components."
