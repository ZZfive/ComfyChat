        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWIntegerMin node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the minimum value between two integer values. It abstracts the process of comparing two integers and returning the minimum value, simplifying operations that require determining the minimum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node requires two input types: 'a' and 'b'. Both 'a' and 'b' are integer values that need to be compared to determine the minimum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWIntegerMin node is an integer value, which represents the minimum value obtained by comparing the two input integers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWIntegerMin node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWIntegerMin node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWIntegerMin node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWIntegerMin node is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the JWIntegerMin node to execute its operation?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node uses the 'execute' function to perform its operation of determining the minimum value between two integer inputs."
