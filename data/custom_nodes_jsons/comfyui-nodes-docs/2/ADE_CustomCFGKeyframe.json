        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node is designed to create and manage custom configuration keyframes within the Animate Diff framework. It allows specifying various animation parameters on the animation timeline for precise control over the animation's behavior and appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node are: cfg_multival (MULTIVAL), start_percent (FLOAT), and guarantee_steps (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cfg_multival' input define in the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg_multival' input defines the configuration value of the keyframe, which can influence various aspects of the animation process. It is crucial for customizing animation characteristics within a specific time period."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start_percent' input in the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' input specifies the starting point of the keyframe on the animation timeline, expressed as a percentage. It allows for precise time control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'guarantee_steps' input determine in the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'guarantee_steps' input determines the minimum number of steps for applying the keyframe configuration, ensuring a certain duration of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node is prev_custom_cfg (CUSTOM_CFG), which allows for chaining custom configuration keyframes to create complex animation sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_CustomCFGKeyframe node is custom_cfg (CUSTOM_CFG), which encapsulates the defined keyframe's custom configuration object, ready for integration into the animation pipeline."
