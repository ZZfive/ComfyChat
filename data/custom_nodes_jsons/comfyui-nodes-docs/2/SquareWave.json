        "question": "What is the purpose of the SquareWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SquareWave node in ComfyUI is designed to generate square wave patterns. It produces square waveforms by adjusting phase, amplitude, and translation, which is crucial for signal processing and waveform analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the phase parameter determine in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter in the SquareWave node determines the position within the waveform's cycle, which is crucial for establishing the timing of square wave transitions. It affects the frequency and starting point of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the square wave in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter in the SquareWave node sets the height of the peaks and troughs, which is essential for defining the strength of the signal. It is a key factor in the overall shape and characteristics of the square wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the x_translation parameter in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The x_translation parameter in the SquareWave node moves the waveform along the X-axis, allowing adjustments to the waveform's position. This parameter is crucial for aligning the waveform with other signals or components in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the y_translation parameter affect the square wave in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The y_translation parameter in the SquareWave node moves the waveform up or down along the Y-axis, affecting the vertical position of the waveform. It is an important parameter for adjusting the position of the waveform relative to other elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the current_frame parameter indicate in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter in the SquareWave node indicates the current position in the sequence of waveforms, which is crucial for the progression and timing of the square wave pattern over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The SquareWave node has two output types: 'output' which represents the computed value of the square wave under the specified parameters, and 'int_output' which provides a discrete version of the waveform values, useful for applications requiring quantization or integer representation of the signal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SquareWave node use?",
        "answer": "The SquareWave node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
