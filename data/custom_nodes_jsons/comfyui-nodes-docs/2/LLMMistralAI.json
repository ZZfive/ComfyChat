        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMMistralAI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMMistralAI node is designed to load and initialize language models from the MistralAI suite, providing an interface to utilize their natural language processing capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMMistralAI node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMMistralAI node are 'model_name' (COMBO[STRING]) and 'api_key' (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model_name' input specify in the LLMMistralAI node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' input specifies the name of the MistralAI model to be loaded, determining the specific language model and its capabilities for processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'api_key' input in the LLMMistralAI node?",
        "answer": "The 'api_key' input is required for authentication with the MistralAI service, allowing access to the model loading functionality and ensuring secure and authorized use of MistralAI's resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMMistralAI node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMMistralAI node is 'model' (LLM_MODEL), which represents the loaded MistralAI language model and embedding model, encapsulated in a structure ready for integration into natural language processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the LLMMistralAI node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the LLMMistralAI node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LLMMistralAI node's load_model function return?",
        "answer": "The load_model function of the LLMMistralAI node returns a tuple containing a dictionary with the loaded MistralAI language model ('llm') and the embedding model ('embed_model')."
