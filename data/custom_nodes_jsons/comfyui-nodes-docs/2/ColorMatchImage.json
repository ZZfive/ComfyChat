        "question": "What is the purpose of the ColorMatchImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorMatchImage node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the colors of an image to match a target color scheme or another image, ensuring color consistency between different elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ColorMatchImage node are 'images' (the source image to be color adjusted), 'reference' (the target image or color scheme to match), 'blur' (the amount of blur applied to the reference image), and 'factor' (the strength of the color matching effect)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blur' input control in the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' input in the ColorMatchImage node controls the amount of blur applied to the reference image, affecting the softness of the color matching."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input determine in the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the ColorMatchImage node determines the strength of the color matching effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the final appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ColorMatchImage node is the 'image' output, which provides the resulting image after color adjustment, showcasing the effect of the color matching process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ColorMatchImage node handle the case when the number of reference images is less than the number of source images?",
        "answer": "If the number of reference images is less than the number of source images, the ColorMatchImage node repeats the first reference image to match the number of source images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ColorMatchImage node is GPU."
