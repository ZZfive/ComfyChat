        "question": "What is the purpose of the OneFormer ADE20K Segmentor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer ADE20K Segmentor node is used for semantic segmentation tasks. It uses the OneFormer model pretrained on the ADE20K dataset to identify and classify each pixel in the input image according to predefined categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is an image that needs to be semantically segmented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is the resolution to which the input image will be resized before processing, which affects the level of detail in the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is an image where each pixel is classified into a specific category according to the ADE20K dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The category of the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node perform semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node performs semantic segmentation by using the OneFormer model pretrained on the ADE20K dataset. It takes an input image, resizes it to the specified resolution, and processes it to classify each pixel into a specific category."
