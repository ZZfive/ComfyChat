        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node in ComfyUI simplifies the processing and visualization of model checkpoint data by generating XY input values based on checkpoint names, CLIP skip values, and VAE names."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node are input_mode, ckpt_count, ckpt_name_i, clip_skip_i, and vae_name_i."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_mode' parameter specify in the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_mode' parameter in the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node specifies the input mode, which determines how checkpoints, CLIP skip values, and VAE names are processed and utilized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ckpt_count' parameter in the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_count' parameter in the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node defines the number of checkpoints to be processed, which affects the size and composition of the output XY values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node is 'optional_lora_stack', which, if provided, adds a LORA stack to the processing of checkpoints, CLIP skip values, and VAE names."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node is 'X or Y', which is a set of XY values derived from the processed checkpoints, CLIP skip values, and VAE names."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node handle different input modes?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: Checkpoint node sets None for Clip Skip and/or VAE if the input mode does not include them, and it extends each sub-array with lora_stack if it's not None."
