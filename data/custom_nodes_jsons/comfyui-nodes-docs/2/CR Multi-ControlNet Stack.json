        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ControlNetStack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ControlNetStack node is used to manage and apply multiple ControlNet configurations in a sequential manner. It allows users to toggle individual ControlNets on or off, adjust their influence, and define the range they should be applied to."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'switch_1' parameter in CR_ControlNetStack control?",
        "answer": "The 'switch_1' parameter determines whether the first ControlNet in the stack is activated. It plays a key role in controlling the flow of signals within the control node, enabling or disabling specific layers of influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'controlnet_strength_1' parameter affect the image generation process in CR_ControlNetStack?",
        "answer": "The 'controlnet_strength_1' parameter adjusts the strength of influence of the first ControlNet. It is a crucial factor in fine-tuning the balance between different control layers within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'image_1' parameter in CR_ControlNetStack?",
        "answer": "The 'image_1' parameter represents the image associated with the first ControlNet. It is essential for providing visual context and guidance to the control mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'CONTROLNET_STACK' output of CR_ControlNetStack contain?",
        "answer": "The 'CONTROLNET_STACK' output contains the compiled list of activated ControlNets and their respective settings, ready to be applied to the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output provide in CR_ControlNetStack?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL to the documentation for further guidance on using the CR_ControlNetStack node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the CR_ControlNetStack node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the CR_ControlNetStack node is CPU."
