        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurvesDivide node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesDivide node performs a division operation between two curves, providing a means to analyze the relationship between them. It is crucial for operations that require curve data normalization or comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfCurvesDivide node?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesDivide node requires two input curves: curve_1 and curve_2. Both inputs are of the Comfy dtype KEYFRAMED_CURVE and Python dtype keyframed.Curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the curve_1 input affect the result in the KfCurvesDivide node?",
        "answer": "The first curve (curve_1) is a fundamental input that defines one of the operands in the division operation. Its values are essential for determining the outcome of the division result, as they directly influence the shape and characteristics of the resulting curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the curve_2 input play in the KfCurvesDivide node?",
        "answer": "The second curve (curve_2) is another important input that acts as the divisor in the division operation. Its importance lies in its influence on the scaling of the resulting curve relative to the first curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurvesDivide node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfCurvesDivide node is a new curve (result_curve) representing the result of dividing the first input curve by the second curve. This result curve is important as it contains the normalized relationship between the two original curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the result_curve output in the KfCurvesDivide node?",
        "answer": "The result_curve output of the KfCurvesDivide node has a Comfy dtype of KEYFRAMED_CURVE and a Python dtype of keyframed.Curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfCurvesDivide node use?",
        "answer": "The KfCurvesDivide node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
