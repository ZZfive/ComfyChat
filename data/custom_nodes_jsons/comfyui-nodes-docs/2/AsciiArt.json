        "question": "What is the purpose of the AsciiArt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AsciiArt node in ComfyUI applies an ASCII art effect to the input image, converting it into a stylized representation using a predefined character set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AsciiArt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AsciiArt node are: image (the input image to apply the ASCII art effect to), char_size (the size of the characters used in the ASCII art representation), and font_size (the font size of the characters used in the ASCII art)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AsciiArt node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AsciiArt node is a torch.Tensor representing the resulting image after applying the ASCII art effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the char_size parameter control in the AsciiArt node?",
        "answer": "The char_size parameter in the AsciiArt node controls the size of the characters used in the ASCII art representation, which determines the granularity of the ASCII art effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the font_size parameter affect the ASCII art in the AsciiArt node?",
        "answer": "The font_size parameter in the AsciiArt node affects the appearance of the final ASCII art image by controlling the font size of the characters used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for running the AsciiArt node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the AsciiArt node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the AsciiArt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AsciiArt node belongs to the 'postprocessing/Effects' category in ComfyUI."
