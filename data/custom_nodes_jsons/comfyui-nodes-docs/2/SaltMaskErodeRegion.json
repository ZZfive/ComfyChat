        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node in ComfyUI applies an erosion filter to mask regions, effectively shrinking the mask areas based on the specified number of iterations. It is designed to optimize mask boundaries by eroding the edges of the mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskErodeRegion node are 'masks' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'iterations' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' input parameter represent in the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter in the SaltMaskErodeRegion node represents the input masks to which the erosion operation will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the regions that the erosion operation will process and optimize."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iterations' input parameter affect the erosion operation in the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' input parameter in the SaltMaskErodeRegion node specifies the number of times the erosion operation is applied to each mask, allowing for adjustment of the strength of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node is 'MASKS' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents the output masks after applying the erosion filter, showing the optimized and shrunk mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node in ComfyUI is 'SALT/Masking/Filter'."
