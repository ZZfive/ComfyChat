        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Sequence Loader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Sequence Loader node in ComfyUI is used to load a series of images from a specified directory based on the current frame counter, allowing for the creation of image sequences and animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Sequence Loader node are: frame_counter, directory_path, pattern, and indexing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'indexing' input determine in the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'indexing' input in the Image Sequence Loader node determines the method for establishing the sequence order of the images, which can be either numeric or alphabetic order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'default_image' input in the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'default_image' input in the Image Sequence Loader node is used as a fallback image when no matching image is found in the directory based on the specified pattern and indexing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Image Sequence Loader node are 'image' and 'frame_name'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output represent in the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the Image Sequence Loader node represents the loaded image from the sequence based on the current frame counter, or the default image if no matching image is found."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_name' output represent in the Image Sequence Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_name' output in the Image Sequence Loader node provides the name of the loaded frame from the sequence, giving context or identification for the image."
