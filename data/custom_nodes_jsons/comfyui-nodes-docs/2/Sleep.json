        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sleep node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node is used to introduce a specified duration of pause in the operation flow. It allows users to precisely control the delay time by setting minutes and seconds, which is particularly useful in scenarios requiring control of processing speed, simulating real operation intervals, or waiting for other resources to be ready."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'input' parameter in the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "The 'input' parameter is a placeholder input that will be returned as is after the delay ends. It ensures the continuity of data during the node operation process, preventing the data flow from being interrupted due to the pause."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Sleep node control the delay time?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node controls the delay time through two parameters: 'minutes' and 'seconds'. 'minutes' specifies the integer number of minutes for the delay, while 'seconds' specifies the fractional number of seconds. Together, they precisely define the total delay time, allowing for both coarse and fine-grained time control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Sleep node output after the specified delay?",
        "answer": "After the specified delay time, the Sleep node outputs the input data unchanged. Essentially, it is a data pass-through with a time delay."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Sleep node use?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of minutes and seconds that can be set in the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "In the Sleep node, the 'minutes' parameter can be set up to a maximum of 1439, while the 'seconds' parameter can be set up to a maximum of 59.99 with a step of 0.01."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name of the Sleep node in the source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the function name of the Sleep node is 'sleepdelay'."
