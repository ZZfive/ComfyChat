        "question": "What is the purpose of the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node in ComfyUI is used to process and analyze XY graph data related to model checkpoints, focusing on validating and processing checkpoint values and clip skip values for efficiency analysis during model training and optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node include target_ckpt, input_mode, batch_path, subdirectories, batch_sort, batch_max, ckpt_count, ckpt_name_i, clip_skip_i, and vae_name_i."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target_ckpt input specify in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The target_ckpt input in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node specifies the target checkpoint type, which can be 'Base' or 'Refiner', to determine the context for processing the XY graph data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the batch_max input affect the XY graph data analysis in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The batch_max input in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node sets an upper limit on the number of batches to consider for the XY graph data analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ckpt_name_i input in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node?",
        "answer": "The ckpt_name_i input in the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node specifies the name of the i-th checkpoint, allowing detailed customization of the checkpoint data included in the XY graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node produce?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node outputs an XY data type, which includes the data type ('Clip Skip' or 'Clip Skip (Refiner)') and the corresponding values to aid in efficiency analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node use?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_Checkpoint node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
