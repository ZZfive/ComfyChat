        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageLevels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageLevels node enhances the visual contrast or corrects exposure of an image by linearly rescaling the color of the image tensor between the given minimum and maximum values, clipping any values outside the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageLevels node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageLevels node are: image (the input image tensor to be adjusted), min (the lower limit of the intensity range), and max (the upper limit of the intensity range)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min' input parameter do in the JWImageLevels node?",
        "answer": "The 'min' input parameter sets the lower limit of the intensity range. Pixels with intensities below this value will be set to the minimum (black), effectively darkening the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max' input parameter do in the JWImageLevels node?",
        "answer": "The 'max' input parameter sets the upper limit of the intensity range. Pixels with intensities above this value will be set to the maximum (white), effectively brightening the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageLevels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageLevels node is an image tensor with adjusted intensity levels, where pixel values are rescaled to fit the newly specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the JWImageLevels node use?",
        "answer": "The JWImageLevels node uses the GPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the source code provided for the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The source code provided is for the JWImageMix node, which mixes or multiplies two input images based on a specified blend type and factor. It is included to show an example of how a custom node can be defined and implemented in ComfyUI."
