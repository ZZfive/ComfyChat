        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Constant_Number node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Constant_Number node is designed to generate a constant number based on a specified type. It provides a flexible way to return a number in different formats such as integer, float, or boolean, depending on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Constant_Number node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Constant_Number node are 'number_type' and 'number'. 'number_type' defines the type of the constant to be generated, and 'number' is the base numeric value used to generate the constant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional parameter 'number_as_text' in the WAS_Constant_Number node do?",
        "answer": "The optional parameter 'number_as_text' allows the node to interpret the input as a textual representation of a number, which can then be converted to the specified numeric type. This provides flexibility for numeric inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Constant_Number node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Constant_Number node is 'constant_number', which represents the constant generated in the specified type. It is the main result of the node's operation and is important for any subsequent tasks that require this constant value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible output formats of the WAS_Constant_Number node?",
        "answer": "The possible output formats of the WAS_Constant_Number node include integer, float, or boolean, depending on the specified 'number_type' input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Constant_Number node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Constant_Number node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the WAS_Constant_Number node found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Constant_Number node is found in the 'WAS Suite/Number' category in ComfyUI."
