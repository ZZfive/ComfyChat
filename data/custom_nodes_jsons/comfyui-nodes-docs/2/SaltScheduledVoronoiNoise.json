        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node in ComfyUI is used to generate visual patterns based on Voronoi noise. It allows scheduling various parameters over time, such as scale, detail, and randomness, to achieve dynamic and evolving visual effects that can be customized based on audio or other time-varying inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node are 'batch_size' (INT), 'width' (INT), and 'height' (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter specify in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node specifies the number of patterns generated in a single execution, allowing for batch processing of noise generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input parameter allows adjusting the noise pattern's detail level over time in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter 'detail_schedule' in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node allows adjusting the noise pattern's detail level over time, affecting complexity and texture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node are 'images' (IMAGE) and 'batch_size' (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' output represent in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' output in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node represents the generated Voronoi noise patterns, outputted as batches of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'width' and 'height' parameters in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The default value for both the 'width' and 'height' parameters in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node is 64."
