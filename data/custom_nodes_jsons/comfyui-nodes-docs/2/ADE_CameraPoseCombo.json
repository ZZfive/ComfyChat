        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraPoseCombo node is designed to create complex camera control poses by combining multiple motion types and their corresponding intensities, allowing for customized camera movements in animated sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node are motion_type1, motion_type2, motion_type3, motion_type4, motion_type5, motion_type6, speed, and frame_length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'speed' parameter control in the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node?",
        "answer": "The 'speed' parameter controls the speed of the camera movement, affecting how quickly the camera transitions between poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'prev_poses' input in the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'prev_poses' input allows for the incorporation of previous camera poses with new movements to achieve seamless transitions in the animation, which is crucial for maintaining narrative or visual continuity in scenes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node is 'cameractrl_poses', which represents the generated camera control poses after combining the specified motions and intensities, ready for use in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ADE_CameraPoseCombo node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraPoseCombo node is located in the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/CameraCtrl/poses' category within ComfyUI."
