        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_TimestepsConditioning node is used to adjust the timing of specific conditions during the animation or diffusion process, allowing for precise control over when certain effects or modifications are introduced in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two required input types for the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node?",
        "answer": "The two required input types for the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node are 'start_percent' and 'end_percent', both of which are specified as FLOAT data types in ComfyUI and float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_percent' input represent in the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' input specifies the starting point (as a percentage of the total animation length) for applying a given condition, allowing for precise timing control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end_percent' input define in the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node?",
        "answer": "The 'end_percent' input defines the ending point (as a percentage of the total animation length) for applying a condition, enabling the effect to be customized to specific stages of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node is 'timesteps_cond', which represents the adjusted timing of the condition, encapsulated in a specific type TIMESTEPS_COND in ComfyUI and TimestepsCond in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node use?",
        "answer": "The ADE_TimestepsConditioning node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ADE_TimestepsConditioning node in ComfyUI is 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning'."
