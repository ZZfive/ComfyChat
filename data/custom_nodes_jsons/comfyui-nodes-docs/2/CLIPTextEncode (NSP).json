        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node is designed to encode text input using the CLIP model, enhanced through Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP) or wildcard text transformations. It aims to provide flexible text encoding capabilities adaptable to various prompt styles and requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of text-to-image or text-based conditioning applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node are: mode (decides whether to use Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcards for text conversion), noodle_key (the keyword used for dynamic text replacement in Noodle Soup Prompts), seed (used for random number generation in text conversion), text (the text input to be encoded), and clip (the CLIP model used for encoding the text)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node decide?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node decides whether to use Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcards for text conversion, which influences how the text is parsed and encoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node are: conditioning (the encoded text output suitable for text-to-image generation or other conditioning contexts), parsed_text (the text after NSP or wildcard transformation processing), raw_text (the original text input before any NSP or wildcard transformations), and ui (a user interface element displaying the parsed text)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node enhance user interaction?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node enhances user interaction by displaying the parsed text through a user interface element, allowing users to see how their input text has been transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node is 'GPU'."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node in ComfyUI is 'WAS Suite/Conditioning'."
