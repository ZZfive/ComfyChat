        "question": "What is the purpose of the `ImageBatchPermute` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchPermute` node in ComfyUI is designed to reorder a batch of images according to a specified permutation. It allows for dynamic reorganization of image sequences for processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the `ImageBatchPermute` node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the `ImageBatchPermute` node are `images`, which is the batch of images to be rearranged, `permute`, which specifies how the images should be arranged in the batch, and `start_with_zero`, which indicates whether the permutation indices start from zero."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `start_with_zero` parameter affect the permutation in `ImageBatchPermute` node?",
        "answer": "The `start_with_zero` parameter in the `ImageBatchPermute` node affects how the permutation indices are applied to the image batch. If it is set to `True`, the permutation indices start from zero; otherwise, they start from one."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the `ImageBatchPermute` node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `ImageBatchPermute` node is `IMAGE`, which represents the rearranged set of images according to the specified permutation pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `ImageBatchPermute` node ensure that the indices are within a valid range?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchPermute` node ensures that the indices are within a valid range by clamping the order tensor to a range from 0 to the number of images minus one."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the base type of the `ImageBatchPermute` node?",
        "answer": "The base type of the `ImageBatchPermute` node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the `ImageBatchPermute` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the `ImageBatchPermute` node in ComfyUI is `image/batch`."
