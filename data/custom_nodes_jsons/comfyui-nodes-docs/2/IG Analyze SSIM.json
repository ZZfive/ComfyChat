        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Analyze SSIM node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node in ComfyUI is used to evaluate the similarity between consecutive images in a given folder using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). It calculates the SSIM values between consecutive image pairs, indicating changes or variations in visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'folder' parameter specify in the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "The 'folder' parameter in the IG Analyze SSIM node specifies the directory containing the images to be analyzed. It is crucial for determining the set of images for SSIM calculation and comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the vertical scale of the SSIM graph be customized in the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "The vertical scale of the SSIM graph can be customized by setting the 'ymin' and 'ymax' parameters in the IG Analyze SSIM node, which allow for adjusting the vertical proportions of the graph to better visualize the SSIM data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "The output of the IG Analyze SSIM node is an image tensor representing a graph of the SSIM data between consecutive images. This graphical output provides a visual summary of the structural similarity trends in the image sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IG Analyze SSIM node handle the calculation of SSIM values?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node calculates the SSIM values by iterating over consecutive image pairs in the specified folder, converting the images to grayscale, and applying the SSIM algorithm to measure the structural similarity between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the SSIM data for a folder already exists in the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "If the SSIM data for a folder already exists, the IG Analyze SSIM node loads the data from the existing JSON file instead of recalculating the SSIM values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of plotting the SSIM data in the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "Plotting the SSIM data in the IG Analyze SSIM node provides a graphical representation of the structural similarity trends between consecutive images, allowing for a visual analysis of the image sequence."
