        "question": "What is the purpose of the Blur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Blur node in ComfyUI applies a Gaussian blur to an image, effectively reducing noise and smoothing edges, which is useful in post-processing steps for image analysis and enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Blur node are 'image', which is the main input for the blur operation, 'blur_radius', which determines the extent of the blur effect, and 'sigma', which influences the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel and directly affects the smoothness of the blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Blur node is the blurred_image, which is the processed result of the input image after applying the Gaussian blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'blur_radius' parameter in the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'blur_radius' parameter in the Blur node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of values for the 'sigma' parameter in the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The range of values for the 'sigma' parameter in the Blur node is from 0.1 to 10.0, with a default value of 1.0 and a step of 0.1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Blur node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Blur node handle the case when the 'blur_radius' is set to 0?",
        "answer": "When the 'blur_radius' is set to 0, the Blur node returns the original input image without applying any blur effect."
