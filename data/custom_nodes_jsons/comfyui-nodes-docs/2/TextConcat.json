        "question": "What is the purpose of the TextConcat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TextConcat node is designed to efficiently combine multiple strings into a single string. It achieves this by accepting a list of texts and a delimiter, then concatenating the provided texts using the specified delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the delimiter parameter in the TextConcat node?",
        "answer": "The delimiter parameter is a string that is used to separate the individual text inputs when they are concatenated. It plays a key role in determining the final format of the output string, allowing the user to control the spacing and separation between the concatenated texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are the text input parameters in the TextConcat node required or optional?",
        "answer": "The text input parameters (text1, text2, text3, text4, text5) in the TextConcat node are all optional. If provided, they will be included in the final concatenated string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the TextConcat node?",
        "answer": "The output of the TextConcat node is the 'concatenated_text', which is the final string resulting from joining all the input texts together using the specified delimiter. It represents the culmination of the concatenation process and is the primary output of the TextConcat node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the TextConcat node utilize?",
        "answer": "The TextConcat node utilizes CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TextConcat node handle empty text inputs?",
        "answer": "The TextConcat node checks each text input (text1, text2, text3, text4, text5) and only appends the non-empty inputs to the list of texts to be concatenated. This ensures that the final concatenated string only includes the provided text inputs and skips any empty ones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the delimiter parameter in the TextConcat node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the delimiter parameter in the TextConcat node is a space character (' ')."
