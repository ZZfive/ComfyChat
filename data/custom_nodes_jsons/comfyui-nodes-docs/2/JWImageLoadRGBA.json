        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageLoadRGBA node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageLoadRGBA node in ComfyUI is specifically designed to load images in RGBA format. It separates the image into color components and an alpha channel, effectively creating a mask based on the alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the JWImageLoadRGBA node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the JWImageLoadRGBA node is 'path', which specifies the file path of the image that needs to be loaded. This is crucial for locating and loading images in RGBA format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the JWImageLoadRGBA node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the JWImageLoadRGBA node are 'image' and 'mask'. 'image' represents the color components of the loaded image, excluding the alpha channel, while 'mask' represents the inverted alpha channel of the image, serving as the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'path' input in the JWImageLoadRGBA node?",
        "answer": "In the JWImageLoadRGBA node, the 'path' input is of STRING data type in ComfyUI, and it corresponds to the str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the 'image' and 'mask' outputs in the JWImageLoadRGBA node?",
        "answer": "In the JWImageLoadRGBA node, the 'image' output is of IMAGE data type in ComfyUI, corresponding to the torch.Tensor data type in Python. The 'mask' output is of MASK data type in ComfyUI, also corresponding to the torch.Tensor data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the JWImageLoadRGBA node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the JWImageLoadRGBA node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWImageLoadRGBA node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWImageLoadRGBA node in ComfyUI is jamesWalker55."
