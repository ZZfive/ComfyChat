        "question": "What is the purpose of the AlphaChanelAdd node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the AlphaChanelAdd node in ComfyUI is to add an alpha channel to images that lack one, ensuring all images in a batch have four channels. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency in image processing tasks that require transparency or other effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the AlphaChanelAdd node is 'images', which represents the batch of images that will have an alpha channel added. It is a key determinant of the node's operation as it specifies the input images to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'images' parameter in the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'images' parameter in the AlphaChanelAdd node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'images' parameter in the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'images' parameter in the AlphaChanelAdd node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AlphaChanelAdd node is 'image', which is a modified version of the input images with an added alpha channel, ensuring all images have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output 'image' in the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output 'image' in the AlphaChanelAdd node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output 'image' in the AlphaChanelAdd node?",
