        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI is designed to process text data using the CLIP model, with the ability to adjust the encoding strength and apply additional weight to the tokens, allowing for fine control over the text encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node are 'text' (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str) and 'clip' (Comfy dtype: CLIP, Python dtype: CLIP)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node do?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node allows for adjusting the encoding strength of the text tokens, modifying the encoding process to better suit the specific requirements of the task at hand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'add_weight' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node do?",
        "answer": "The 'add_weight' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node provides the ability to apply additional weight to the tokens during the encoding process, which can be used to further fine-tune the encoding according to the needs of the task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node is 'pooled_output' (Comfy dtype: DICT, Python dtype: Dict[str, Any]), which represents the aggregated and condensed representation of the encoded text, encapsulating the essence of the text for further use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node's 'encode' function do?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node's 'encode' function tokenizes the input text using the CLIP model, applies the specified strength and additional weight to the tokens if needed, encodes the tokens and returns the conditioning and pooled output."
