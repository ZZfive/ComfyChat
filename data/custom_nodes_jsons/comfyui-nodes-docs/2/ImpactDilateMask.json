        "question": "What is the purpose of the DilateMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DilateMask node is designed to perform morphological dilation on binary masks, expanding the boundaries of foreground objects in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What tasks can benefit from using the DilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The DilateMask node is particularly beneficial for tasks such as object detection and segmentation refinement by increasing the size of segmented regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mask' parameter in the DilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is a binary mask that defines the regions of interest within an image. It is crucial for the dilation process as it determines which areas will be expanded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dilation' parameter specify in the DilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' parameter specifies the amount of dilation to be applied to the mask. Positive values cause the mask edges to expand, while negative values cause them to contract."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DilateMask node is the 'dilated_mask', which is the result of applying the dilation operation to the input mask. It is a binary mask with expanded foreground objects based on the specified dilation factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the DilateMask node use?",
        "answer": "The DilateMask node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'dilation' parameter in the DilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'dilation' parameter in the DilateMask node is 10."
