        "question": "What is the purpose of the ScheduleToCond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScheduleToCond node in ComfyUI is designed to process and apply a given prompt schedule to a CLIP model, integrating the prompt schedule with the CLIP model to generate a set of conditional inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip' parameter in the ScheduleToCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter in the ScheduleToCond node is crucial as it represents the CLIP model to which the prompt schedule will be applied. It is the core component that determines the subsequent conditional processing and the output generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'prompt_schedule' parameter used in the ScheduleToCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt_schedule' parameter in the ScheduleToCond node defines the schedule for applying prompts to the CLIP model. It is essential for determining how text prompts will modulate the behavior of the model during the processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'CONDITIONING' represent in the ScheduleToCond node?",
        "answer": "The output 'CONDITIONING' in the ScheduleToCond node represents the set of conditions derived from the prompt schedule and applied to the CLIP model. It is important as it forms the basis for further operations or serves as input for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the ScheduleToCond node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ScheduleToCond node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ScheduleToCond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ScheduleToCond node in ComfyUI is 'promptcontrol'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ScheduleToCond node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ScheduleToCond node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
