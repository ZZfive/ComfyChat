    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the KfDebug_Segs node and how does it help?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the KfDebug_Segs node is a mask, which helps refine the segmentation process by specifying regions of interest in the image. It enhances the node's ability to focus on specific segments, thereby improving the overall segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfDebug_Segs node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the KfDebug_Segs node are segmented_image and segmentation_map. The segmented_image represents the result of the segmentation process, with different parts of the input image identified and distinguished. The segmentation_map provides a detailed map of the segmentation, indicating the boundaries and classifications of each segment in the image."
