        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node is designed to generate final images by decoding and post-processing the output of a variational autoencoder (VAE). It encapsulates the logic required to convert the latent space representation into visual output, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node requires the 'custom_output' parameter as its input type. This parameter is crucial as it serves as the input to the VAE decoding process. It is the output of the previous stage and contains the necessary information required for the node to perform its function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node produces 'image' as its output type. This output is the result of VAE decoding and post-processing, representing the final visual product of the node's operation. It is essential for further analysis or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the specific functions and characteristics of the SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode node has the following specific functions and characteristics:\n- Class name: SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode\n- Category: UI.CATEGORY_MAGIC_CUSTOM_STAGES\n- Output node: False\n- Repo Ref: https://github.com/jobunk/SeargeSDXL.git\n- It decodes and post-processes the output of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate final images.\n- It encapsulates the logic required to convert VAE's latent space representation into visual output, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the workflow."
