        "question": "What is the purpose of the ValueSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ValueSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to animate and interpolate values based on a given keyframe text representation. It parses the input text to determine keyframe values and then interpolates between these keyframes to produce smooth value transitions over a specified number of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ValueSchedule node is 'text', which is a string containing the keyframe definitions for animating values. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly affects the output animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_frames' parameter specify in the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' parameter in the ValueSchedule node specifies the total number of frames over which the animation occurs. It is essential for determining the interpolation range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'current_frame' parameter in the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the ValueSchedule node represents the current position in the animation sequence. It is crucial for calculating the interpolation of the animation's current state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_output' parameter do when set to True in the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "When set to True, the 'print_output' parameter in the ValueSchedule node enables printing the current frame and its interpolation to the console, which is useful for debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the ValueSchedule node is 'value', which represents the interpolated value for the current frame. This output is essential for continuing the animation or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ValueSchedule node use?",
        "answer": "The ValueSchedule node uses the CPU infra type."
