        "question": "What is the purpose of the make_seamless method in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless class?",
        "answer": "The make_seamless method in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless class is designed to process a set of images and convert them into seamless textures by applying blending techniques to the edges of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node are images (the input images to be processed into seamless textures) and blending (the blending factor that determines the degree of blending to be applied at the image edges)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blending factor in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node control?",
        "answer": "The blending factor in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node controls the degree of blending applied at the image edges. A higher value results in a smoother transition but also reduces the image size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the tiled parameter in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node?",
        "answer": "The tiled parameter in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node indicates whether the output should be a single seamless image or a 2x2 tiled version for better visualization of the seamless effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the tiles parameter in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node specify?",
        "answer": "The tiles parameter in the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node specifies the number of tiles in each direction (horizontal and vertical) in the tiled output when the tiled parameter is set to true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node is the processed seamless texture image result, which can be tiled without showing visible seams, making them suitable for use in various graphics applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Image_Make_Seamless node is CPU."
