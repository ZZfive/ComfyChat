        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node is designed to extract and process condition data from a given point in time within a schedule, providing a seamless way to analyze and utilize the state of the schedule at that moment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the schedule parameter in the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node?",
        "answer": "The schedule parameter is crucial because it contains the structured data and configuration necessary for the node to determine the condition state at the specified time. It serves as the primary input driving the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the time parameter important in the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node?",
        "answer": "The time parameter is essential as it indicates the specific time at which the node needs to evaluate the schedule. It directly affects the output by determining which set of conditions will be extracted and processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node provide?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node provides a detailed set of condition data reflecting the state of the schedule at the specified time. This information is crucial for further analysis and decision-making processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node?",
        "answer": "The KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node's main function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node's main function is CONDITIONING, which is a tuple containing the detailed condition data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node's main function process the schedule and time inputs?",
        "answer": "The KfGetScheduleConditionAtTime node's main function processes the schedule and time inputs by calling the evaluate_schedule_at_time function with the provided schedule and time parameters, which returns the interpolated condition data at the specified time."
