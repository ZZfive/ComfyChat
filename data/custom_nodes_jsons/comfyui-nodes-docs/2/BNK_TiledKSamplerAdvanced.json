    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter define in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class is crucial for the sampling process as it defines the infrastructure and parameters of the sampling process. It determines the types of data that can be handled and the quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'add_noise' parameter influence the sampling process in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class controls whether noise is introduced into the sampling process, which affects the diversity and randomness of the generated samples. This is crucial for achieving diversified results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'noise_seed' parameter play in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_seed' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class plays a crucial role in ensuring the repeatability of the noise generation process. It allows for consistent results when the same seed is used."

    {
        "question": "How do the 'tile_width' and 'tile_height' parameters affect the sampling process in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_width' and 'tile_height' parameters in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class determine the horizontal and vertical dimensions of each tile, respectively, affecting the granularity of the sampling process. They are key in achieving detailed control over the spatial distribution of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tiling_strategy' parameter determine in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'tiling_strategy' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class determines the method used to divide the sampling space, which can significantly influence the efficiency and consistency of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter influence the output in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class defines the number of iterations the sampling process will undergo. It directly affects the complexity and refinement of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'positive' and 'negative' parameters in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' and 'negative' parameters in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class provide positive and negative conditioning inputs, respectively. These inputs guide the sampling process towards desired results and away from undesired ones, shaping the characteristics of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' parameter contain in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter in the TiledKSamplerAdvanced class contains the latent representation of an image, which is a core input to the sampling process. It directly influences the quality and characteristics of the generated samples."
