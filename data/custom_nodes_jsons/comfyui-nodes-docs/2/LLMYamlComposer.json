        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMYamlComposer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMYamlComposer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate YAML documents from given text inputs by utilizing specified classifiers and any additional provided instructions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the llm_model input in the LLMYamlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The llm_model input specifies the language model to be used for generating the YAML document. It plays a crucial role in interpreting the input text and the classifiers to produce well-structured YAML output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the classifier_list input in the LLMYamlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The classifier_list input is a comma-separated list of classifiers used to guide the language model in structuring the input text into a YAML document, helping to categorize and organize the data more effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the extra_directions input in the LLMYamlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The extra_directions input allows for additional instructions to guide the language model in generating a more customized and specific YAML document."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the yaml_output represent in the LLMYamlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The yaml_output represents the structured and formatted YAML document generated based on the input text, classifiers, and any additional provided instructions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the LLMYamlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the LLMYamlComposer node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMYamlComposer node handle the input data to generate YAML documents?",
        "answer": "The LLMYamlComposer node utilizes a language model specified by llm_model to interpret the input text and classifiers. It then generates a structured YAML document based on the provided data, classifiers, and any additional instructions, ensuring proper formatting and comprehensive data inclusion."
