        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ModelInputSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelInputSwitch node is designed to select between two provided models based on an input value, simplifying the model selection process in workflows without the need for complex branching logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Input' parameter in the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter is crucial for deciding which model to select. It guides the node's logic to choose between 'model1' or 'model2' based on its value, thereby influencing the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "When does the 'model1' parameter become important in the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'model1' parameter becomes important when the 'Input' parameter is set to 1. It is an optional input that represents the first model the node can select."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what condition is the 'model2' parameter considered in the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'model2' parameter is considered when the 'Input' parameter is not equal to 1. In this case, it determines the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'MODEL' output represent in the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'MODEL' output represents the model selected based on the 'Input' parameter. It is the result of the node's decision process about which model to provide."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL to the node's documentation, offering additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infratype used by the CR_ModelInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelInputSwitch node uses the CPU as its infra type."
