        "question": "What is the purpose of the UnaryImageOp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnaryImageOp node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various single-input image operations such as image inversion, averaging, rounding, clamping, and absolute value calculation, which are crucial for image preprocessing and feature extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the UnaryImageOp node?",
        "answer": "The UnaryImageOp node requires two input parameters: 'image', which represents the image data that will undergo the specified unary operation, and 'op', which specifies the type of unary operation to be applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the UnaryImageOp node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the UnaryImageOp node specifies the unary operation to be applied to the input image. It is a key determinant of the node's functionality as it decides the type of transformation to be performed, with options including 'invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', and 'abs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the UnaryImageOp node?",
        "answer": "The output of the UnaryImageOp node is the 'result' parameter, which represents the transformed image data after applying the specified unary operation to the input image. This output is crucial as it lays the foundation for any subsequent image analysis or processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the choice of operation in the UnaryImageOp node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The choice of operation in the UnaryImageOp node can significantly alter the characteristics of the resulting image, thereby influencing downstream processing. For instance, inverting an image will produce a color-inverted result, while averaging will compute the mean color of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the UnaryImageOp node use?",
        "answer": "The UnaryImageOp node uses the GPU infrastructure type for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the UnaryImageOp node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the UnaryImageOp node defines the class structure, including the initialization, input and output types, function category, and the main processing function 'op_image' that performs the specified unary operation on the input image."
