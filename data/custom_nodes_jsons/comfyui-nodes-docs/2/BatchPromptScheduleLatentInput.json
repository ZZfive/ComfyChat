        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node in ComfyUI FizzNodes?",
        "answer": "The BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node in ComfyUI FizzNodes is designed to process and generate animated prompts for creating animated sequences in a batch processing environment. It accepts various parameters such as text, latent quantities, and weights to control the interpolation of prompts across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node are 'text', which is a string containing the base prompt for the animation, and 'num_latents', which specifies the number of latent variables used in the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_output' parameter do in the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_output' parameter is an optional boolean flag. When set to True, it prints the output of the animated prompts to the console, which is useful for debugging purposes or for a visual inspection of the prompts as they are generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_frame' parameter affect the animation sequence in the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_frame' parameter is an optional parameter that determines the starting frame of the animation sequence. It allows customization of the animation's starting point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'pw_a' parameter play in the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The 'pw_a' parameter is a floating-point number representing the weight used for interpolating animated prompts. It influences the transition between frames and helps in smoothing the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node are 'POS', which provides positive conditioning information for each frame of the animation, 'NEG', which provides negative conditioning information, and 'INPUT_LATENTS', which contains the latent variables used in the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput node is CPU."
