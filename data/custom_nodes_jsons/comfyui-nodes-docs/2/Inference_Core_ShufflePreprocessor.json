        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is used to preprocess images by applying a content shuffling operation. This operation aims to detect and possibly rearrange elements within the image to enhance or modify its content, preparing it for further processing steps, especially in tasks that require content manipulation or enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node are: image (the image to be processed), resolution (the resolution the image should be resized to before processing), and seed (the seed for the random number generator used in the shuffling operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the resolution input parameter affect in the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution input parameter specifies the resolution the image should be resized to before processing. It affects the granularity of the shuffling operation, with higher resolutions allowing for more detailed manipulations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the seed input parameter in the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The seed input parameter is used for the random number generator in the shuffling operation. It allows for reproducible shuffling effects across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is an image (the processed image after applying the content shuffling operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type recommended for the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is used for detecting and shuffling content in the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The ContentShuffleDetector class from the controlnet_aux.shuffle module is used for detecting and shuffling content in the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node."
