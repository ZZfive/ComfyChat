        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node is to enhance the contrast of regions within each mask of a set of masks by applying histogram equalization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node requires an input type of 'masks', which is a set of masks that need to be processed for contrast enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskHistogramEqualizationRegion node is 'MASKS', which represents the set of masks after contrast enhancement through histogram equalization."
