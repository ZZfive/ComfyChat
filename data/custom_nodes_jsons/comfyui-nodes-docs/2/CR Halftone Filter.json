        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_HalftoneFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_HalftoneFilter node in ComfyUI is used to apply a halftone effect to images, simulating the appearance of print dots. It provides customization options for dot shape, size, and resolution to create various halftone styles and enhance visual effects in graphic design and artistic applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_HalftoneFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_HalftoneFilter node are: image (the input image to apply the halftone effect), dot_size (the size of the dots used in the halftone effect), dot_shape (the shape of the dots, either ellipse or rectangle), resolution (the resolution of the halftone effect), angle_c (the angle for the cyan channel in CMYK color space), angle_m (the angle for the magenta channel), angle_y (the angle for the yellow channel), angle_k (the angle for the key/black channel), greyscale (a flag indicating if the input image should be processed as greyscale), antialias (enables or disables anti-aliasing), and border_blending (enables smoothing of transitions between halftone dots near image edges)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dot_size' parameter control in the CR_HalftoneFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'dot_size' parameter in the CR_HalftoneFilter node controls the size of the dots used in the halftone effect. Larger dot sizes result in a coarser appearance, while smaller sizes provide more detailed details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'antialias' parameter in the CR_HalftoneFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'antialias' parameter in the CR_HalftoneFilter node enables or disables anti-aliasing, which smooths the edges of halftone dots and reduces visual artifacts. This can make the final image appearance more natural and refined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_HalftoneFilter node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_HalftoneFilter node are an IMAGE (the output image with the applied halftone effect) and a show_help string (providing a link to documentation or help page for further guidance on using the node)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'greyscale' parameter affect the processing of the input image in the CR_HalftoneFilter node?",
        "answer": "When the 'greyscale' parameter is enabled in the CR_HalftoneFilter node, the input image is processed as greyscale, applying the halftone effect only to the luminance channel and simplifying the output to monochrome tones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_HalftoneFilter node use for processing?",
        "answer": "The CR_HalftoneFilter node uses the CPU infra type for processing."
