        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Remove_Background node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Remove_Background node in ComfyUI is designed to process images by removing the background, effectively extracting the foreground. It works by converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and using a binary threshold to create a mask that isolates the desired elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Remove_Background node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Remove_Background node include 'images', which are the input images that the node will process to remove the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in WAS_Remove_Background node do?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Remove_Background node determines whether the node will remove the background or the foreground of the image. It's an optional parameter that allows for flexibility in processing different types of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'threshold' parameter affect the background removal process in the WAS_Remove_Background node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter is crucial in controlling the sensitivity of the background removal process. It sets the level at which grayscale values are considered background or foreground, directly impacting the node's ability to differentiate between the two."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'threshold_tolerance' parameter play in the WAS_Remove_Background node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold_tolerance' parameter defines the radius of the Gaussian blur used to smooth the image before applying the threshold. It influences the node's ability to handle noise and detail in the image, playing an important part in the quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WAS_Remove_Background node output?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Remove_Background node outputs 'images' which are the processed images with the background removed. This output represents the main result of the node's image processing task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Remove_Background node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Remove_Background node is CPU."
