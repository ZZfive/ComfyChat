        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node is designed to generate and manage animated keyframes with camera control, creating dynamic and complex camera movements within the AnimateDiff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node is 'start_percent', which specifies the starting percentage of the animation, allowing precise control over the timing of camera movements and effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node include 'prev_ad_keyframes', 'scale_multival', 'effect_multival', 'cameractrl_multival', 'inherit_missing', and 'guarantee_steps'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prev_ad_keyframes' input allow in the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_ad_keyframes' input allows the inclusion of previously defined AnimateDiff keyframes, enabling more complex sequencing and layering of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'inherit_missing' input in the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'inherit_missing' input determines whether missing values in the current keyframe should be inherited from the previous keyframe, ensuring continuity in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node is 'ad_keyframes', which generates a series of AnimateDiff keyframes with complex camera movements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node use?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiff+CameraCtrl Keyframe node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
