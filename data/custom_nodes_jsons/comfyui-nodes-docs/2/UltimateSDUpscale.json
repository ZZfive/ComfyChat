    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_by' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_by' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node determines the magnification factor of the image, directly affecting the size and level of detail of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'tile_width' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node affect the magnification process?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_width' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node sets the width of the tiles used during processing, which can affect the efficiency and quality of the magnification process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seam_fix_mode' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'seam_fix_mode' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node determines the method used to fix seams between tiles, which can improve the visual continuity and overall quality of the magnified image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'force_uniform_tiles' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node ensure?",
        "answer": "The 'force_uniform_tiles' parameter in the UltimateSDUpscale node ensures that all tiles have the same size, which can simplify processing and improve the uniformity of the magnified image."
