        "question": "What is MiDaS_Depth_Approx?",
        "answer": "MiDaS_Depth_Approx is a custom node in ComfyUI that is designed to approximate the depth of an image using the MiDaS model. It is categorized under the \"WAS Suite/Image/AI\" category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the input parameter `image`?",
        "answer": "The `image` parameter is a required input for the MiDaS_Depth_Approx node. It represents the input image that the node will process to generate an estimated depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output does the MiDaS_Depth_Approx node produce?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS_Depth_Approx node produces the output `images`, which is the depth estimation generated by the node. This output is crucial for downstream tasks that require understanding the scene's spatial dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `midas_approx` method?",
        "answer": "The `midas_approx` method is used to estimate the depth of an image using the MiDaS model. It accepts parameters such as `image`, `use_cpu`, `midas_type`, `invert_depth`, and `midas_model`, which control aspects like the type of CPU/GPU usage, the MiDaS model architecture, and whether to invert the depth values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MiDaS_Depth_Approx node handle optional parameters?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS_Depth_Approx node can accept optional parameters such as `use_cpu`, `midas_type`, `invert_depth`, and `midas_model`. These parameters enable users to configure how the node should process the input image, the type of MiDaS model it should use, and whether to invert the depth values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `midas_model` parameter?",
        "answer": "The `midas_model` parameter is optional and allows users to provide a preloaded MiDaS model. This can simplify the processing workflow, especially when the same model needs to be used repeatedly, as it eliminates the need to load the model within the node itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the installation process for the MiDaS model?",
        "answer": "The `install_midas` method is used to install the MiDaS model if it is not already installed. It checks for the presence of the `timm` package and if it is not found, it installs it. It then marks the `MIDAS_INSTALLED` flag as True to indicate that the model is installed."
