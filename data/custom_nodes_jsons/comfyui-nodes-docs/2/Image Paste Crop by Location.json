        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node in ComfyUI is designed to operate on and integrate images by pasting one image onto another at a specified location, then cropping the result. It allows for fine-tuning the blending and sharpness of the pasted image, providing seamless integration into the target image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node are 'image' and 'crop_image'. 'image' is the main image onto which 'crop_image' will be pasted. Both are of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype PIL.Image.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input parameters are available in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node includes optional input parameters such as 'top', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'crop_blending', and 'crop_sharpening'. These parameters allow for precise control over the positioning, blending, and sharpness of the pasted image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'crop_blending' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_blending' parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node controls the blending factor of the pasted image, affecting how much it blends with the main image, which in turn influences the final visual appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node produce?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node produces two output types: 'result_image' and 'result_mask'. 'result_image' is the final image after the pasting and cropping process, and 'result_mask' is a mask image generated by the blending process, which can be used for further image operations or as a transparency mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'crop_sharpening' parameter do in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_sharpening' parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop_Location node controls the sharpening level of the pasted image. Increasing this value enhances the sharpness of the pasted image, making it more distinct."
