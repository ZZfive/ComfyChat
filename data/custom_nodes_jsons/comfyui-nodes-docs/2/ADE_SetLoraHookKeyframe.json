        "question": "What is the purpose of the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node is used to assign a set of LoRA hook keyframes to a specific LoRA hook group, allowing for customization and dynamic adjustment of LoRA hook behavior on the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node are 'lora_hook' (Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK, Python dtype: LoraHookGroup) and 'hook_kf' (Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES, Python dtype: LoraHookKeyframeGroup)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_hook' input parameter represent in the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_hook' input parameter represents the LoRA hook group to which the keyframes will be applied. It is crucial for identifying the target hook group that will receive the new keyframe settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'hook_kf' input parameter represent in the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The 'hook_kf' input parameter represents the set of LoRA hook keyframes that will be assigned to the specified LoRA hook group. It defines the timing, strength, and other characteristics of the LoRA hooks on the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node is 'lora_hook' (Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK, Python dtype: LoraHookGroup), which represents the updated LoRA hook group with the new keyframe set applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node use?",
        "answer": "The Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'set_hook_keyframes' method in the Set LoRA Hook Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The 'set_hook_keyframes' method takes a LoRA hook group and a set of LoRA hook keyframes as input, creates a new LoRA hook group by cloning the original one, applies the keyframes to the new hook group, and returns the updated LoRA hook group."
