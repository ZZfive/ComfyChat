        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstantID Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Settings node in ComfyUI is used to configure the settings for generating an InstantID, allowing customization of various parameters such as influence weight, strength, noise level, and the start and end points of the ID generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ip_weight' parameter in the InstantID Settings node define?",
        "answer": "The 'ip_weight' parameter in the InstantID Settings node defines the influence weight of the InstantID, affecting its overall role in the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'cn_strength' parameter in the InstantID Settings node affect the generated InstantID?",
        "answer": "The 'cn_strength' parameter in the InstantID Settings node sets the strength of the content noise, influencing the variability and uniqueness of the generated InstantID."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noise' parameter in the InstantID Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' parameter in the InstantID Settings node specifies the level of noise to be added to the InstantID, increasing its randomness and complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'start' and 'end' parameters in the InstantID Settings node affect the InstantID generation process?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter determines the starting point of the InstantID generation, allowing for phased or progressive application, while the 'end' parameter defines the ending point, marking the completion of its application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InstantID Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InstantID Settings node in ComfyUI is BASIC_PIPE, which represents the configured InstantID settings in the form of a tuple that can be directly used in the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the InstantID Settings node use?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Settings node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
