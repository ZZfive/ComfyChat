        "question": "What is the purpose of the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI is used for preprocessing images by detecting faces and generating corresponding masks, enhancing the segmentation of the input image by focusing on facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_faces' parameter control in the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_faces' parameter determines the maximum number of faces the model should detect in the input image. It controls the granularity of face detection and affects the balance between performance and accuracy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'min_confidence' parameter affect face detection in the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_confidence' parameter sets the minimum confidence threshold for face detection. It filters out detections below this confidence level, which helps ensure the quality of the generated segmentation masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'resolution_upscale_by' parameter in the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution_upscale_by' parameter scales the resolution of the input image by a factor. Upscaling the image can improve detection accuracy but may increase computational demands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is SEGS_PREPROCESSOR, which represents a preprocessed image with detected faces and segmentation masks, used as input for downstream semantic segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe_FaceMesh_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is located in the InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet category within ComfyUI."
