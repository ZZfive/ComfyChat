        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMQueryEngine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMQueryEngine node in ComfyUI is designed to process and execute queries using language models, combining vector indexing and similarity post-processing to retrieve relevant responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMQueryEngine node are llm_model, which represents the language model used to process queries, and llm_index, which is used to retrieve vector embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the llm_model input in the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The llm_model input in the LLMQueryEngine node is crucial for executing queries as it determines the engine's understanding and generation capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the llm_index input do in the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The llm_index input in the LLMQueryEngine node is essential for identifying relevant documents or entries based on the query by retrieving vector embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the LLMQueryEngine node are query, which is the user's query input to be processed by the engine, and llm_message, which is an optional list of messages that can be included in the query context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMQueryEngine node is results, which encapsulates the relevance and context of the information retrieved by the engine."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LLMQueryEngine node is GPU."
