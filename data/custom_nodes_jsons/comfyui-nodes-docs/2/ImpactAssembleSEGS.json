        "question": "What is the purpose of the AssembleSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AssembleSEGS node is used to combine seg headers and elements into a coherent structure, playing a key role in aggregating segmentation data and ensuring that headers and elements are properly assembled into a complete segmentation set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'seg_header' parameter in the AssembleSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_header' parameter is crucial for defining the metadata of the segmentation process, determining how the segmented elements will be interpreted and structured in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seg_elt' parameter in the AssembleSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_elt' parameter contains the actual data elements that need to be segmented, influencing the execution of the node by determining what the final segmentation will contain."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AssembleSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the AssembleSEGS node is a structured segmentation set, which is the result of combining the segmentation headers and elements, representing the final form of the segmented data ready for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the AssembleSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the AssembleSEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the AssembleSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the AssembleSEGS node is SEGS, which is a tuple containing a list of strings and a list of any data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the AssembleSEGS node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AssembleSEGS node belongs to the ImpactPack/Util category in ComfyUI."
