        "question": "What is the purpose of the SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree) node is to provide a simplified version of the SDXL Power Prompt designed for scenarios requiring negative prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'rgthree' refer to in the documentation?",
        "answer": "In the context of the provided documentation, 'rgthree' appears to be a category for the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'output node' being set to False?",
        "answer": "Setting the 'output node' to False in the feature description suggests that the node does not have a direct output, or it outputs in a way that is not captured in this documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input required for the node?",
        "answer": "The input required for the node includes a 'prompt_g' (a global prompt) and a 'prompt_l' (a local prompt), both of which are mandatory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the node includes a 'CONDITIONING' output, which helps guide the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Choose the correct description for the SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree) node.",
        "answer": "The SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree) node is a simplified version of the SDXL Power Prompt designed for scenarios requiring negative prompts. It does not handle Loras, which means it simplifies the process by not loading this feature, making it more efficient for specific use cases."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the typical way to use the SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree)?",
        "answer": "Typically, the SDXL Power Prompt - Simple Negative (rgthree) is used by providing a global prompt and a local prompt through the 'prompt_g' and 'prompt_l' inputs, respectively. Additional options like setting the output node, opt_clip, target width, height, crop width, and height can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the generation process."
