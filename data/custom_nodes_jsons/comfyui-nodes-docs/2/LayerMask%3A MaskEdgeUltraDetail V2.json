        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node in ComfyUI is used to process relatively rough masks to obtain ultra-fine edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two methods available in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 for processing edges?",
        "answer": "The two methods available in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 for processing edges are PyMatting and OpenCV-GuidedFilter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_grow' parameter do in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_grow' parameter in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 controls the expansion amplitude of the mask. Positive values expand the mask outwards, while negative values shrink the edge inwards."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'fix_gap' parameter be used in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2?",
        "answer": "In MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2, the 'fix_gap' parameter can be used to fill gaps in the mask. If there are obvious gaps in the mask, increasing this value appropriately can help."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'detail_range' parameter control in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2?",
        "answer": "The 'detail_range' parameter in MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 controls the range of edge details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node?",
        "answer": "The MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node outputs two types of data: 'image' which is the processed image, and 'mask' which is the processed mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node use?",
        "answer": "The MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2 node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
