        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurveFromString node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurveFromString node is designed to interpret and convert a string representation of a mathematical curve into a format that can be used for further processing. It encapsulates the logic for parsing Chigozie strings, which is a compact way of describing keyframed curves, and outputs a curve object that can be used for visualization or various mathematical and graphical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfCurveFromString node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfCurveFromString node is a chigozie_string, which is a string that defines a curve using Chigozie notation. This input is crucial for the node to generate the corresponding curve object and directly affects the shape and characteristics of the output curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfCurveFromString node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfCurveFromString node is a curve object, which represents the mathematical curve defined by the input string. This curve object is the main result of the node's operation and can be used for rendering, analysis, or further processing in keyframe-based workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the KfCurveFromString node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the KfCurveFromString node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the KfCurveFromString node?",
        "answer": "The category of the KfCurveFromString node is defined by the variable CATEGORY in the class definition."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the KfCurveFromString node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the KfCurveFromString node is not an output node. It is indicated as False in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the KfCurveFromString node's main function?",
        "answer": "The return type of the KfCurveFromString node's main function is a tuple containing a single element, which is the curve object (KEYFRAMED_CURVE)."
