        "question": "What is the purpose of the MultiplicationNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MultiplicationNode in ComfyUI performs arithmetic operations on input values, scaling and adjusting them based on the provided multiplier and addend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MultiplicationNode are: numberA (any_type), multiply_by (FLOAT), and add_by (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiply_by' input do in the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The 'multiply_by' input in the MultiplicationNode is the multiplier applied to the base value, significantly influencing the scale of the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'add_by' input do in the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The 'add_by' input in the MultiplicationNode is the value added to the multiplication result, fine-tuning the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The output types of the MultiplicationNode are: a (FLOAT) and b (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' output represent in the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The 'a' output in the MultiplicationNode represents the floating-point result of the arithmetic operation, a scaled and adjusted version of the input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' output represent in the MultiplicationNode?",
        "answer": "The 'b' output in the MultiplicationNode represents the integer result of the arithmetic operation, providing a discretized version of the input value's transformation."
