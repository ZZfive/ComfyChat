        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_Repeater node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_Repeater node is a utility node designed to repeat the items in a list a specified number of times. It takes a list of items and an integer representing the number of repetitions, then outputs a new list where each item is repeated according to the given count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'input_data' parameter in the CR_Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_data' parameter represents the list of items to be repeated. It is a crucial part of the node's operation as it determines the content of the new list to be generated. The impact of this parameter is direct as it decides what will be repeated, thus influencing the final output list."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'repeats' parameter affect the output in the CR_Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeats' parameter specifies the number of times each item in the 'input_data' list should be repeated. It is a key element as it directly influences the length of the output list. The value of 'repeats' must be a positive integer to ensure the repetition process is meaningful and the output list is correctly formed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'list' output parameter represent in the CR_Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The 'list' output parameter is the result of the repetition process, containing each item from 'input_data' repeated 'repeats' times. It is significant as it represents the transformed version of the original list, which is the main goal of the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the documentation or help page associated with the CR_Repeater node. It serves as a quick reference for users seeking more information or assistance on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_Repeater node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_Repeater node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_Repeater node handle input data that is not a list?",
        "answer": "If the input data is not a list, the CR_Repeater node will create a new list by repeating the single input item 'repeats' times and return this new list along with the 'show_help' URL."
