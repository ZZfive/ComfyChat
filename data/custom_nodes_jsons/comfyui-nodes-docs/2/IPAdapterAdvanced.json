        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterAdvanced node is designed to apply advanced image processing techniques using an IPAdapter model. It intelligently combines different embeddings and weights to enhance the model's performance in tasks such as style and composition transfer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IPAdapterAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IPAdapterAdvanced node are: model (base model for applying image processing), ipadapter (adapter and configuration for image processing tasks), and image (input image to be processed)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'weight' parameter in the IPAdapterAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'weight' parameter allows users to adjust the influence of image processing on the model. It is important for fine-tuning the node's performance to achieve the desired balance between the original and processed images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IPAdapterAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IPAdapterAdvanced node is a processed model that incorporates advanced image processing techniques. It represents the final state of the model after all transformations have been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the IPAdapterAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the IPAdapterAdvanced node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the IPAdapterAdvanced node support style and composition transfer for non-SDXL models?",
        "answer": "No, the IPAdapterAdvanced node currently only supports style and composition transfer for SDXL models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'clip_vision' parameter is not provided when using the IPAdapterAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "If the 'clip_vision' parameter is not provided when using the IPAdapterAdvanced node, an exception will be raised, indicating that the CLIPVision model is missing."
