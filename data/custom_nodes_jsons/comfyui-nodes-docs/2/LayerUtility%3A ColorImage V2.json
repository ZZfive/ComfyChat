        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight 'x' and two seeds. It generates the noise based on 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)'."

    {
        "question": "How is the noise generated by cg-noise calculated in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The noise generated by cg-noise is calculated based on 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)' in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What is the role of the weight 'x' in cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The weight 'x' in cg-noise is used to control the balance between the variation seed and the original seed when generating noise in ComfyUI."
