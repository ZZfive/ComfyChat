        "question": "What is the purpose of the Saw Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve node in ComfyUI is used to generate a linear ramp wave that loops over a specified period, creating a sawtooth wave animation based on the frame count and time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Saw Curve node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Saw Curve node are: frame_counter, max_value, min_value, periodicity_seconds, and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_value' parameter represent in the Saw Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter in the Saw Curve node represents the maximum value that the sawtooth curve can reach within its period, defining the peak of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'periodicity_seconds' parameter control in the Saw Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'periodicity_seconds' parameter in the Saw Curve node determines the duration of a complete cycle of the sawtooth curve in seconds, which controls its frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'phase' parameter in the Saw Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the Saw Curve node allows for phase shifting of the sawtooth curve, enabling the waveform to be advanced or delayed within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Saw Curve node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Saw Curve node are FLOAT and INT. FLOAT represents the calculated floating-point value of the sawtooth curve for the current frame, while INT represents the integer value of the sawtooth curve, obtained by rounding the calculated floating-point result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Saw Curve node use?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
