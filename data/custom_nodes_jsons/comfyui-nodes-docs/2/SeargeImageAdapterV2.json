        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeImageAdapterV2 class in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the conversion and adaptation of image data for use in user interface prompting purposes. It plays a key role in integrating source images, image masks, and uploaded masks into a structured data stream that UI components can effectively utilize."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the source_image parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class?",
        "answer": "The source_image parameter is crucial for the operation of the SeargeImageAdapterV2 node as it represents the raw image data that needs to be processed. It significantly influences how the node transforms and constructs data for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the image_mask parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class define?",
        "answer": "The image_mask parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class defines a mask to be applied to the source image. It is important to the node because it determines the regions of the image that will be processed or highlighted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the uploaded_mask parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class?",
        "answer": "The uploaded_mask parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class allows the inclusion of a user-uploaded mask in the image processing pipeline. Its presence can alter the behavior of the node by providing additional context for image operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the data parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class?",
        "answer": "The data parameter in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class serves as a container for additional data that may be required for the node's operation. It is optional and can be used to pass supplementary information to the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the data output in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class?",
        "answer": "The data output in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class is a structured data stream that encapsulates the processed image and mask information. It is important because it provides the necessary input for subsequent UI components or downstream processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the S_IMAGE_INPUTS output in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class contain?",
        "answer": "The S_IMAGE_INPUTS output in the SeargeImageAdapterV2 class contains image inputs that have been adapted for use in UI prompting. It is crucial for correct display and interaction within the user interface."
