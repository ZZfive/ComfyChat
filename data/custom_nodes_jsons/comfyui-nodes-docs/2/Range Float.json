        "question": "What is the purpose of RangeFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RangeFloat node in ComfyUI is designed to create a sequence of floating-point numbers within a specified range. It generates a list of numbers from a starting point to an ending point with a given step size, and then selects a number from this list based on a seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' parameter define in the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter in the RangeFloat node defines the beginning of the range for generating numbers. It is crucial as it sets the initial point of the sequence and determines the direction of the range (whether increasing or decreasing). This parameter directly impacts the output numbers and the overall behavior of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end' parameter specify in the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'end' parameter in the RangeFloat node specifies the endpoint of the range. It is essential as it determines the final value in the generated sequence of numbers. The 'end' value is used in conjunction with the 'start' and 'step' parameters to determine the total number of numbers generated within the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'step' parameter affect the output of the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter in the RangeFloat node determines the increment between each consecutive number in the generated sequence. It is important as it controls the density of numbers within the range. A smaller step size will result in a finer-grained output, while a larger step size will result in a coarser distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'seed' parameter play in the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the RangeFloat node introduces a controllable element of randomness when selecting a number from the generated list. It is important as it ensures that the selection process is repeatable and can be adjusted to achieve different results without changing the underlying range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'selected_number' represent in the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The output 'selected_number' in the RangeFloat node represents the floating-point number selected from the generated sequence. It is important as it is the primary result of the node's operation and can be used for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the output 'representation' in the RangeFloat node?",
        "answer": "The output 'representation' in the RangeFloat node provides a string representation of the selected number, which is useful for scenarios that require text format, such as logging or display."
