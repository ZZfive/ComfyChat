        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: VAE node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: VAE node in ComfyUI is designed to simplify the integration and operation of VAE (Variational Autoencoder) models in the generative art workflow. It specifically generates or converts images based on VAE features, abstracting the complexity of handling VAE models, including loading, encoding, and decoding operations, to streamline the creation of visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the XY Input: VAE node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the XY Input: VAE node include input_mode, batch_path, subdirectories, batch_sort, batch_max, vae_count, and vae_name_i. These inputs specify the mode of operation, file system paths, processing order, and the number and names of VAE models to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_mode' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'input_mode' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node specifies the input mode, determining whether the VAE model is loaded individually or processed in batches. This influences how VAE files are handled and used in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'batch_sort' parameter affect the processing of VAE files in the XY Input: VAE node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_sort' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node decides the processing order of VAE files in batch mode, supporting ascending or descending sorting. This affects the order in which VAE models are used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'vae_count' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae_count' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node specifies the number of individual VAE models to be loaded and processed in non-batch mode, guiding the node on the expected number of VAE models to handle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae_name_i' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'vae_name_i' parameter in the XY Input: VAE node identifies each individual VAE model by name in non-batch mode, allowing the selection and loading of specific VAE models for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the XY Input: VAE node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the XY Input: VAE node is an XY tuple, representing the 'X' or 'Y' value associated with the data or features of the processed VAE model."
