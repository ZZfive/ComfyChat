        "subject": "ComfyUI-Noise",
        "question": "What can be adjusted in the noisyphere custom node?",
        "answer": "The noisyphere custom node allows for complete control over noise settings, including noise properties, amplitude, and corner radius."

        "question": "What are the noise mouse modes in the noisyphere custom node?",
        "answer": "The noisyphere custom node provides two noise mouse modes: \"turbulent noise\" and \"gradual noise\"."

        "question": "What are the seeded noise and unchecked seeds in the noisyphere custom node?",
        "answer": "The noisyphere custom node gives the option to use seeded noise or unchecked seeds. If seeded noise is selected, it uses the seeds for control object generation, otherwise, the seeder uses all computational results of the node to set its seeds."
