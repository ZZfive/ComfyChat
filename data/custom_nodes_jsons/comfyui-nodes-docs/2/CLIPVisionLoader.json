        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPVisionLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPVisionLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently load and process visual data from CLIP models. It abstracts the complexity of file handling and provides a simplified interface for accessing visual representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'clip_name' parameter in the CLIPVisionLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_name' parameter is crucial for specifying the unique identifier of the visual data to be loaded. It plays a key role in the node's operation as it guides the retrieval process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPVisionLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPVisionLoader node is 'CLIP_VISION', which represents the loaded visual data in tensor form, essential for further processing and analysis within the model pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'CLIP_VISION' output in the CLIPVisionLoader node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'CLIP_VISION' output in the CLIPVisionLoader node is torch.Tensor in both Comfy and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CLIPVisionLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CLIPVisionLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CLIPVisionLoader node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPVisionLoader node belongs to the 'loaders' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIPVisionLoader node load the visual data?",
        "answer": "The CLIPVisionLoader node loads the visual data using the 'load_clip' function, which takes the 'clip_name' as input and retrieves the corresponding visual data using the 'folder_paths.get_full_path' and 'comfy.clip_vision.load' functions."
