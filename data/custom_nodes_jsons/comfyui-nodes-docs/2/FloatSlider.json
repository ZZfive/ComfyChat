        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatSlider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatSlider node in ComfyUI is designed to normalize a given number within a specified range, ensuring it falls between a minimum and maximum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'number' parameter represent in the FloatSlider node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' parameter represents the value to be normalized within the specified range. It is crucial as it directly affects the output of the node, determining the position of the normalized number on a standard scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'min_value' parameter function in the FloatSlider node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter defines the lower limit of the normalization range. It plays a key role in ensuring the output value is within the expected constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'max_value' parameter play in the FloatSlider node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter sets the upper limit for the normalization range. It is essential in scaling the input number to ensure it does not exceed the specified maximum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'step' parameter in the FloatSlider node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter is used to control the granularity of the number normalization. It influences how the number is adjusted within the range, affecting the precision of the normalized value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'scaled_number' represent in the FloatSlider node?",
        "answer": "The 'scaled_number' output represents the normalized value of the input number, scaled to fit within the specified range. It is important as it provides a standardized measure that can be used for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type does the FloatSlider node use?",
        "answer": "The FloatSlider node uses the CPU infra type."
