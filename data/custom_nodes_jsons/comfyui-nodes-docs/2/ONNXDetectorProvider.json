        "question": "What is the purpose of the ONNXDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ONNXDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the loading and provisioning of ONNX models for detection tasks. It serves as an interface for integrating ONNX-based detection models into workflows, abstracting the complexities of model loading and setup."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the model_name parameter in the ONNXDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The model_name parameter is crucial for identifying the specific ONNX model to be loaded. It ensures that the correct model is used for detection tasks, which affects the execution of the node and the accuracy of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ONNXDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ONNXDetectorProvider node is BBOX_DETECTOR, which provides a configured ONNXDetector object for performing object detection tasks. This object encapsulates the functionality of the ONNX model and is a core component in the detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the ONNXDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the ONNXDetectorProvider node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ONNXDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ONNXDetectorProvider node is ImpactPack."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ONNXDetectorProvider node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the ONNXDetectorProvider node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the load_onnx function in the ONNXDetectorProvider class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the load_onnx function in the ONNXDetectorProvider class is a tuple containing a single element of type core.ONNXDetector."
