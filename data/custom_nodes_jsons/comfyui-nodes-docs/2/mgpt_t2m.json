        "question": "What is the purpose of the mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI utilizes the MotionGPT model to convert text descriptions into motion data sequences, enabling the generation of motion sequences based on natural language input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the mgpt_t2m node are: mgpt_model (MotionGPT model), motion_length (expected length of the generated motion sequence), seed (random seed value), and text (text description as creative input)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the motion_length parameter in the mgpt_t2m node control?",
        "answer": "The motion_length parameter in the mgpt_t2m node specifies the expected length of the generated motion sequence, influencing the granularity of motion details and the overall time span of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the seed parameter important in the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter in the mgpt_t2m node ensures the reproducibility of the generated motion sequences under the same input conditions, which is crucial for consistency in experiments and verifiability of results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The output of the mgpt_t2m node is motion_data, which is a sequence of motion data generated based on the text description, represented as changes in joint positions over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the mgpt_t2m node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the mgpt_t2m node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_t2m node is classified under the MotionDiff/mGPT category in ComfyUI."
