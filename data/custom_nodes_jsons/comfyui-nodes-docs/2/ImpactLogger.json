        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactLogger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogger node is designed to provide logging functionality for capturing and outputting information about the data being processed. It is especially useful for debugging purposes, allowing developers to inspect the shape and content of data at different stages of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'data' parameter in the ImpactLogger node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter is essential for the logging process as it represents the core data that the ImpactLogger node is designed to record. It is through this parameter that the node captures and prints the shape and content of the data for debugging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'prompt' parameter in the ImpactLogger node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter serves as an optional descriptor that can be used to provide additional context or specific identifiers for the data being logged. This can be particularly useful when tracking multiple data points or when log outputs are used for further analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the ImpactLogger node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter allows for the inclusion of additional information that may be relevant to the logging process. This could include metadata or any other ancillary details that are not directly related to the core 'data' being logged but are still significant for the debugging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output' of the ImpactLogger node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'output' of the ImpactLogger node is an empty dictionary, indicating that the primary function of the node is to log information rather than produce significant outputs that will be passed on to subsequent nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactLogger node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogger node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactLogger node print the logged information?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogger node prints the logged information by displaying the shape (if available) and the content of the 'data', followed by the 'prompt' on a new line, both preceded by specific identifiers for clarity in the debugging process."
