        "question": "What is the purpose of VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node provides a mechanism to introduce noise variations during the detail enhancement process, generating modified noise patterns based on specified seeds and strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node are 'seed' (of type INT) and 'strength' (of type FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' parameter do in the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is crucial for generating variation-induced noise, ensuring the reproducibility and consistency of the noise pattern across different executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the output in the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter determines the degree of influence of the variation-induced noise on the final noise output, allowing for fine control over the introduced texture variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node is DETAILER_HOOK, which is a detail enhancer hook configured with variation-induced noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node use?",
        "answer": "The VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node belong?",
        "answer": "The VariationNoiseDetailerHookProvider node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Detailer' category."
