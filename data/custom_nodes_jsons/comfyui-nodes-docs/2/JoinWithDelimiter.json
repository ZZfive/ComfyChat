        "question": "What is the purpose of the JoinWithDelimiter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JoinWithDelimiter node is designed to simplify the process of combining text strings from a list into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate each item."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JoinWithDelimiter node?",
        "answer": "The JoinWithDelimiter node requires two input types: a list of text strings (text_list) and a delimiter. The text_list is of Comfy dtype ANY and Python dtype List[str], while the delimiter is of Comfy dtype COMBO and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the delimiter parameter in the JoinWithDelimiter node specify?",
        "answer": "The delimiter parameter specifies the character or string used to separate the elements in the text_list. The choice of delimiter affects the readability and structure of the resulting string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JoinWithDelimiter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JoinWithDelimiter node is a single string (result) that contains all elements from the text_list joined together using the specified delimiter. It is of Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the JoinWithDelimiter node support infrastructure type CPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the JoinWithDelimiter node supports the infrastructure type CPU."

    {
        "question": "In the source code of the JoinWithDelimiter node, what happens if the delimiter is specified as 'newline'?",
        "answer": "In the source code, if the delimiter is specified as 'newline', it is converted to the newline character '\\n'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JoinWithDelimiter an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JoinWithDelimiter node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
