        "question": "What is the purpose of the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the details of image frames by utilizing segmentation information. It processes each segment separately to improve the visual quality of animated differences, focusing on areas defined by bounding boxes or cropping regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image_frames' parameter in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_frames' parameter is crucial as it provides the raw image data that the node will process. It serves as the foundation for applying detail enhancement, and its quality directly affects the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'guide_size' parameter influence the detail enhancement process in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'guide_size' parameter determines the size of the guide image used for detail enhancement. It is a key factor in controlling the level of detail added to the image frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'seed' parameter play in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used for random number generation within the node, ensuring the reproducibility of results. It is an important aspect when consistent results are desired across multiple runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'feather' parameter affect the output in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'feather' parameter is used to soften the edges of the enhanced segments, providing a smoother transition between the detailed areas and the rest of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'basic_pipe' parameter in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'basic_pipe' parameter provides the essential base models and components required for the detail enhancement process. It is a critical input that enables the node to perform its function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output parameter represent in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output parameter represents the final enhanced image frames with improved details. It is the main result of the node's processing and reflects the effectiveness of the applied detail enhancement techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'segs' output parameter provide in the DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' output parameter provides updated segmentation information after the detail enhancement process. It includes new segments that integrate the enhanced details into the original segmentation data."
