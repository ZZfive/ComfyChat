        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageBatchGet node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchGet node is designed to extract specific images from an image batch based on a given index. It simplifies the process of handling image batches and allows for selective retrieval of images, especially when only a subset of the batch is needed for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageBatchGet node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageBatchGet node are 'images' and 'index'. The 'images' parameter represents the image batch from which specific images are to be retrieved, and the 'index' parameter specifies the position of the image to be extracted from the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' parameter in the ImageBatchGet node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter in the ImageBatchGet node specifies the position of the image to be extracted from the batch. It is crucial for precisely locating the desired image within the batch for further operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageBatchGet node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageBatchGet node is 'image'. It is the image extracted from the specified index position in the batch, allowing focused processing or analysis of individual images from large collections."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageBatchGet node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchGet node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImageBatchGet node belong?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchGet node belongs to the 'image/batch' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the ImageBatchGet node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the ImageBatchGet node defines the class 'ImageBatchGet', its input and output types, and the main function 'node' that takes 'images' and 'index' as inputs and returns the image at the specified index position from the batch."
