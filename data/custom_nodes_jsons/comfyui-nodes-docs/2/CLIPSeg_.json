        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPSeg node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSeg node in ComfyUI is designed to perform image segmentation using text prompts and image inputs. It creates segmentation masks consistent with the provided text descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPSeg node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPSeg node are 'image' and 'text'. The 'image' parameter is the main input for segmentation, while the 'text' parameter provides the descriptive prompt guiding the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blur' parameter in the CLIPSeg node control?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' parameter in the CLIPSeg node allows users to adjust the smoothness of the segmentation mask. It helps refine the edges of the mask and improve the overall quality of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'heatmap mask' output of the CLIPSeg node useful?",
        "answer": "The 'heatmap mask' output of the CLIPSeg node is a visual representation of the segmentation mask, where the intensity of colors corresponds to the confidence level of the segmentation. It is suitable for visual analysis and debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'dilation_factor' parameter in the CLIPSeg node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation_factor' parameter in the CLIPSeg node is important for expanding the boundaries of the segmentation mask. It can be used to ensure that the segmented region covers the entirety of the target object."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIPSeg node generate the final segmentation mask?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSeg node generates the final segmentation mask by applying a threshold to convert the continuous segmentation mask into a binary mask. The threshold determines the cutoff point between objects and background in the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the CLIPSeg node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CLIPSeg node is GPU, as indicated in the usage tips."
