        "question": "What is the purpose of the SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SemSegPreprocessor node is designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It uses the UniFormer model to perform semantic segmentation on input images, converting them into segmented outputs where each pixel is classified according to semantic categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the key step performed by the SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The key step performed by the SemSegPreprocessor node is converting input images into semantically segmented images, which is crucial for further analysis or model training in the field of semantic segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SemSegPreprocessor node is an image to be processed for semantic segmentation. This parameter is essential as it represents the raw data that will be converted into a semantically segmented image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SemSegPreprocessor node is the resolution, which specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before performing semantic segmentation. This parameter affects the level of detail in the segmentation output, with higher resolutions potentially yielding more detailed segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SemSegPreprocessor node is the result of the semantic segmentation process. It is a segmented version of the input image, where each pixel is classified according to its semantic category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infratype does the SemSegPreprocessor node require?",
        "answer": "The SemSegPreprocessor node requires a GPU infratype for operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SemSegPreprocessor node perform semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "The SemSegPreprocessor node performs semantic segmentation by utilizing the UniFormer model. It preprocesses the input image, runs it through the UniFormer model, and produces a semantically segmented output image."
