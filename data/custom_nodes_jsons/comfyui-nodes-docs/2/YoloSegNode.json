        "question": "What is the purpose of the YoloSegNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The YoloSegNode is designed to perform semantic segmentation using a YOLO-based model, identifying and masking instances of specific categories in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the YoloSegNode?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the YoloSegNode are an input image and a model_name parameter that determines the specific YOLO model used for segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the class_id parameter in the YoloSegNode do?",
        "answer": "The class_id parameter allows users to specify which category should be segmented in the image, focusing the node's output on the desired category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the YoloSegNode produce?",
        "answer": "The YoloSegNode outputs a segmented image (SEG_IMAGE) highlighting the identified category instances and a corresponding mask (SEG_MASK) that is a binary representation of the segmented category instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEG_MASK output in the YoloSegNode?",
        "answer": "The SEG_MASK output serves as a precise tool for further analysis or manipulation of the identified categories in the image, providing a binary representation of the segmented instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the YoloSegNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the YoloSegNode is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the YoloSegNode process the input image to generate the segmented image and mask?",
        "answer": "The YoloSegNode processes the input image by using the specified YOLO model to identify instances of the desired category, generating a segmented image with highlighted instances and a binary mask representing the segmented instances."
