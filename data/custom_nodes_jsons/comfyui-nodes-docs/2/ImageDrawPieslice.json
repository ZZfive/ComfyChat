        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageDrawPieslice node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawPieslice node in ComfyUI is used to draw a pie slice shape on an image canvas. It allows customization of the pie slice's dimensions, start and end angles, outline, and fill color, providing a way to visually represent data portions or create graphical elements in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageDrawPieslice node include width, height, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, start, end, outline_size, outline_red, outline_green, outline_blue, outline_alpha, fill_red, fill_green, fill_blue, fill_alpha, SSAA, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' parameter represent in the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageDrawPieslice node, the 'start' parameter represents the starting angle of the pie slice, measured in degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'outline_alpha' parameter control in the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "The 'outline_alpha' parameter in the ImageDrawPieslice node controls the transparency component of the outline color of the pie slice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'SSAA' parameter in the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "The 'SSAA' parameter in the ImageDrawPieslice node represents the supersampling anti-aliasing factor, which is used to improve the rendering quality of the pie slice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available methods for resizing the image after drawing the pie slice in the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "The available methods for resizing the image after drawing the pie slice in the ImageDrawPieslice node are lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageDrawPieslice node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageDrawPieslice node is an image tensor that contains the drawn pie slice."
