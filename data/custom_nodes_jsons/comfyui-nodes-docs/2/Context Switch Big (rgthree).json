        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Switch Big node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node is designed to manage multiple context inputs and select the first non-empty context to output. This functionality allows for dynamic context switching in workflows, ensuring that a valid context is always passed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the Context Switch Big node are ctx_01, ctx_02, ctx_03, ctx_04, and ctx_05. These parameters represent multiple optional context inputs, providing flexibility for dynamic selection and switching of contexts in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node outputs the selected non-empty context, which is its main output used for passing to subsequent nodes in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the output types of the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "Some of the output types of the Context Switch Big node include MODEL, CLIP, VAE, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, LATENT, IMAGE, SEED, STEPS, STEP_REFINER, CFG, CKPT_NAME, SAMPLER, SCHEDULER, CLIP_WIDTH, CLIP_HEIGHT, TEXT_POS_G, TEXT_POS_L, TEXT_NEG_G, TEXT_NEG_L, MASK, and CONTROL_NET."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Context Switch Big node use?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Switch Big node determine which context to output?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node determines which context to output by selecting the first non-empty context from the optional input parameters ctx_01, ctx_02, ctx_03, ctx_04, and ctx_05."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ui output in the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The ui output in the Context Switch Big node is the selected non-empty context from the given inputs. This output is crucial for passing a valid context to subsequent nodes in the workflow."
