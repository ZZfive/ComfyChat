        "question": "What is the purpose of the method `number_input_switch` in Class `WAS_Number_Input_Switch`?",
        "answer": "The method `number_input_switch` in Class `WAS_Number_Input_Switch` offers a flexible way to process numerical input based on a boolean condition. It exemplifies the node's capability to perform conditional logic operations on data and allows for diverse handling of numerical information in a controllable and predictable manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by Class `WAS_Number_Input_Switch`?",
        "answer": "The required input types are `number_a` and `number_b`, both of which are numerical values. Additionally, `boolean` is an optional input that acts as a switch to determine how the numerical inputs are processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types produced by the method `number_input_switch`?",
        "answer": "The output types are a tuple containing the original number, its float representation, and its integer form. This comprehensive output provides multiple perspectives on the processed numerical data, catering to various downstream requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Number_Input_Switch class?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Number_Input_Switch class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the method `number_input_switch` handle numerical inputs when the boolean parameter is True?",
        "answer": "When the boolean parameter is True, the method `number_input_switch` processes the numerical input specified by the 'number_a' parameter. It returns a tuple containing this number, its float representation, and its integer form."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the method `number_input_switch` handle numerical inputs when the boolean parameter is False?",
        "answer": "When the boolean parameter is False, the method `number_input_switch` processes the numerical input specified by the 'number_b' parameter. It returns a tuple containing this number, its float representation, and its integer form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name of the method `number_input_switch`?",
        "answer": "The function name of the method `number_input_switch` is `number_input_switch`."
