        "question": "What is the purpose of easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node is designed to handle negative conditional inputs for XY plots. It dynamically generates values and conditions based on the specified negative inputs, helping create intuitive charts representing negative conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of negative conditions that can be specified in the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node allows specifying up to four negative conditions, represented by 'i' ranging from 1 to 4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node has optional input types: negative_1, negative_2, negative_3, and negative_4, all of which are of Comfy dtype 'C' and Python dtype 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node outputs processed XY values and conditions, encapsulating negative conditions in a format suitable for plotting. The output is of Comfy dtype 'X_Y' and Python dtype 'Dict[str, List]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node belong?",
        "answer": "The easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node belongs to the 'EasyUse/XY Inputs' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are negative conditions processed in the source code of easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of easy XYInputs: NegativeCond node, negative conditions are processed by appending corresponding values and conditions to the 'values' and 'cond' lists if the respective negative inputs are not None."
