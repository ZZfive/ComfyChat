        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSizeAndBatchSize node is designed to extract and return key image attributes such as size and batch dimensions, facilitating further processing and analysis within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node is 'image', which is crucial as it serves as the main input for the node to perform its function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node are 'width', 'height', and 'batch_size', representing the horizontal dimension, vertical dimension, and the number of images in a batch, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node represents the horizontal dimension of the image, which is a fundamental aspect of image analysis and processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'height' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'height' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node represents the vertical dimension of the image, playing a key role in understanding and manipulating image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' output parameter in the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node indicates the number of images in a batch, which is crucial for optimizing computational efficiency and managing resources during image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ImageSizeAndBatchSize node is CPU."
