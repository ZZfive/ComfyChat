        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ClampValue node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ClampValue node in ComfyUI is designed to ensure that a given value stays within a specified range. It operates by clamping the input value 'a' between 'range_min' and 'range_max', thereby ensuring the output is always within user-defined acceptable limits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the input parameter 'a' in the CR_ClampValue node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'a' represents the value to be clamped. It is a crucial input because the primary function of the node is to ensure this value adheres to the specified range limits. The operation of the node is directly influenced by the magnitude of 'a', making it a central component in the clamping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'range_min' parameter function in the CR_ClampValue node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'range_min' defines the lower limit of the acceptable range for the input value 'a'. It plays a significant role in the clamping operation as it sets the minimum constraint that 'a' can reach. This parameter is crucial in preventing the output from falling below a desired threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'range_max' parameter play in the CR_ClampValue node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'range_max' sets the upper limit in the clamping operation for the input value 'a'. It is essential as it determines the maximum value that 'a' can take, thereby preventing the output from exceeding the set constraints and controlling the result of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'a' represent in the CR_ClampValue node?",
        "answer": "The output 'a' represents the clamped value, adjusted to fall within the specified range. It is the direct result of the node's clamping function, representing the value of 'a' after being constrained by 'range_min' and 'range_max'. This output is significant as it is the primary product of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the output 'show_help' in the CR_ClampValue node?",
        "answer": "The output 'show_help' provides a URL link to documentation for further help or information about the node's usage. It serves as a useful resource for users who may need additional guidance to utilize the node effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_ClampValue node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_ClampValue node uses the CPU infra type."
