        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageExtractFromBatch node extracts a single image from a batch of images based on a specified index, allowing for individual image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node are 'images' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'index' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' input represent in the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input represents the batch of images from which a single image will be extracted. It is essential for selecting a specific image for processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' input represent in the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' input represents the index of the image to be extracted from the batch of images. It determines which image is selected for extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node is 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents the single image extracted from the input batch at the specified index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the source code for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node available in the provided documentation?",
        "answer": "No, the source code provided in the documentation is for the JWImageLoadRGB node, not the JWImageExtractFromBatch node."
