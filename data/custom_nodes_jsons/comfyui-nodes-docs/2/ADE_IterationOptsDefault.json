        "question": "What is the purpose of the `create_iter_opts` method in the IterationOptionsNode class?",
        "answer": "The `create_iter_opts` method in the IterationOptionsNode class is designed to configure iteration settings for the sampling process. It allows users to specify the number of iterations as well as batch and seed offsets, which are crucial for controlling the sampling program and ensuring diverse outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'iterations' parameter define in the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter in the IterationOptionsNode defines the number of times the sampling process will repeat. It is a fundamental aspect of the node operation as it directly affects the number of outputs generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'iter_batch_offset' parameter in the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'iter_batch_offset' parameter in the IterationOptionsNode is used to adjust the batch index for each iteration. It plays a role in the sampling process, allowing for variations in the sequence of the generated outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iter_seed_offset' parameter affect the sampling process in the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'iter_seed_offset' parameter in the IterationOptionsNode specifies the offset of the seed used in each iteration. By changing the starting point of the random number generation for each iteration, it can introduce diversity in the sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'ITERATION_OPTS' represent in the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The output 'ITERATION_OPTS' in the IterationOptionsNode represents the configured iteration options for the sampling process. It encapsulates the user-defined settings and is crucial for subsequent steps in the sampling workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the IterationOptionsNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the IterationOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the IterationOptionsNode is 'iterations' of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int. The optional input types are 'iter_batch_offset' and 'iter_seed_offset', both of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int."
