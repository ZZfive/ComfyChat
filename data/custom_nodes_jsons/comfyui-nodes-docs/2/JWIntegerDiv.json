        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWIntegerDiv node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerDiv node in ComfyUI performs a division operation between two integer inputs, producing a floating-point result. It abstracts the mathematical division operation, allowing division functionality to be integrated into data processing flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWIntegerDiv node?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerDiv node requires two input types: 'a' (the dividend, an integer value to be divided) and 'b' (the divisor, an integer value used to divide the dividend)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWIntegerDiv node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWIntegerDiv node is a floating-point number representing the result of the division operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWIntegerDiv node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWIntegerDiv node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWIntegerDiv node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWIntegerDiv node is not an output node. It is indicated as 'False' in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWIntegerDiv node?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWIntegerDiv node is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the JWIntegerDiv node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the JWIntegerDiv node defines the class with the specified identifier and display name, category, input types, return types, output node status, and the execute function that takes the inputs and returns the result of the division operation."
