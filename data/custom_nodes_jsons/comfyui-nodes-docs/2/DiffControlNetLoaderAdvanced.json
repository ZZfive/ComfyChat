        "question": "What is the purpose of the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node is designed to load and manage advanced control nets for complex model operations in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial for the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node as it defines the base model to which the control net will be applied, directly influencing the execution of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'control_net_name' parameter affect the functionality of the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'control_net_name' parameter specifies the name of the control net to be loaded, playing a key role in identifying the correct control net configuration for the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'timestep_keyframe' parameter in the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'timestep_keyframe' parameter allows specifying time-related keyframes in the control net, providing finer control over the behavior of the control net over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output CONTROL_NET from the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node represent?",
        "answer": "The output CONTROL_NET represents the loaded control net, ready to be applied to the model, encapsulating the configuration and weights of the control net."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type does the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node run?",
        "answer": "The DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node runs on the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node do if the loaded control net is an advanced control net?",
        "answer": "If the loaded control net is an advanced control net, the DiffControlNetLoaderAdvanced node verifies all the weights of the control net."
