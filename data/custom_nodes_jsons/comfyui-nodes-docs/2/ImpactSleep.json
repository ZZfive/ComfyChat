        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactSleep node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSleep node in ComfyUI is designed to introduce a delay in the execution flow. It accepts a signal and a duration in seconds, pausing the process for the specified time and allowing other tasks to be scheduled or executed concurrently."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactSleep node are 'signal' and 'seconds'. 'signal' is a generic input used to pass control or state information into the node. 'seconds' specifies the duration of the delay introduced by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'seconds' parameter in the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'seconds' parameter in the ImpactSleep node is 0.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactSleep node is 'signal_opt', which provides the original signal after the delay has been introduced, ensuring the workflow can continue seamlessly with the same control or state information."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImpactSleep node an output node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImpactSleep node is an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImpactSleep node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImpactSleep node is ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test."
