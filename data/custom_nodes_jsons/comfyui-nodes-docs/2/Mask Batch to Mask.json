        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class in ComfyUI is designed to process a batch of mask tensors and extract a single mask tensor based on a specified batch number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'masks' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class is crucial as it represents the collection of mask tensors that the node will process, forming the basis for the node's operation and determining which masks will be considered for extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'batch_number' parameter play in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_number' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class specifies which mask tensor to extract from the batch. It is important because it determines the selection process within the node, ensuring that the correct mask is returned based on the batch index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'single_mask' output represent in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The 'single_mask' output in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class represents the single mask tensor extracted from the batch. It is significant because it is the primary result of the node's operation, providing users with the specific mask they requested."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'batch_number' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'batch_number' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class is 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified 'batch_number' is not found in the masks batch in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class?",
        "answer": "If the specified 'batch_number' is not found in the masks batch in the WAS_Mask_Batch_to_Single_Mask class, an error message is printed, and the last tensor from the masks batch is returned."
