        "question": "What is the purpose of the GeneralSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GeneralSwitch node is designed to manage data flow based on a selection index. It determines the active input by evaluating the provided option index and routes the corresponding input to the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'select' parameter in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter is crucial for determining which input will be processed by the node. It specifies the index of the input that should be considered active."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sel_mode' parameter influence the functioning of the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'sel_mode' parameter decides whether the selection is based on the prompt or the execution context. This can affect how the node interprets the selection and, consequently, the flow of execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'unique_id' parameter play in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is used to identify the node within the workflow. It is crucial for the node's ability to reference its own position and context within a larger system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter contains additional information that the node may require for its operation. It provides specific context details that can enhance the node's operational capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'selected_value' output represent in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_value' output represents the input value that the node has chosen based on the provided option index. It carries the data that will be further processed or used downstream in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'selected_label' output provide in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_label' output provides a label associated with the selected input. It serves to give a human-readable identifier for the selected data, enhancing the interpretability of the node's output."
