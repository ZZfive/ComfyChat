        "question": "What is the primary function of DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode is a node that integrates translation services and CLIP text encoding functionality. It translates text input into different languages and encodes these translations into a format suitable for use with conditioning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'from_translate' parameter in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'from_translate' parameter specifies the source language for translation, supporting a dynamic range of languages based on the selected translation service. This parameter plays a key role in determining the initial language of the text to be translated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the target language for translation specified in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The target language for translation is defined by the 'to_translate' parameter, which allows the text to be converted into multiple languages supported by the selected translation service."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'add_proxies' parameter indicate in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'add_proxies' parameter indicates whether to enable the use of proxies for the translation service, affecting how translation requests are sent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'auth_data' parameter in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'auth_data' parameter contains authorization data required by certain translation services, ensuring secure access to the translation functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the translation service specified in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The translation service is specified by the 'service' parameter, allowing selection among various supported translation providers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip' parameter in DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter is used to encode the translated text into a format compatible with conditioning models. It is a CLIP model instance that is crucial for integrating the translation output with downstream AI processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs of DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The outputs of DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode are 'conditioning' and 'string'. 'conditioning' is the encoded representation of the translated text, formatted for use with conditioning models. 'string' is the translated text itself, providing the direct output of the translation process."
