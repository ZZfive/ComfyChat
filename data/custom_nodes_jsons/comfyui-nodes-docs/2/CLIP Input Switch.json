        "question": "What is the purpose of the `clip_switch` method in the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch class?",
        "answer": "The `clip_switch` method is designed to conditionally select one of two provided CLIP objects based on a boolean flag. It acts as a logical switch in the workflow, directing the flow of data based on the truthiness of the boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node are `clip_a` and `clip_b`, both of which are CLIP objects. `clip_a` is conditionally selected when the boolean parameter is true, while `clip_b` is selected when the boolean parameter is false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'boolean' input in the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'boolean' input is a flag that determines which CLIP object will be returned by the node. It directly influences the output selection logic of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node is a single CLIP object, which can be either `clip_a` or `clip_b` depending on the value of the boolean parameter. This output represents the result of the node's conditional logic."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_CLIP_Input_Switch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what happens when the 'boolean' input is true?",
        "answer": "When the 'boolean' input is true, the `clip_switch` method returns `clip_a`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what happens when the 'boolean' input is false?",
        "answer": "When the 'boolean' input is false, the `clip_switch` method returns `clip_b`."
