        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageToMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageToMask node is designed to extract a single color channel from the input image and convert it into a grayscale representation, which can be used for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the imageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the imageToMask node is an image, which is crucial for the node's operation as it serves as the source from which the desired color channel is extracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the imageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the imageToMask node is the channel parameter, which determines which color channel is extracted from the image, affecting the final result of the grayscale conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the imageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the imageToMask node is a tensor representing the grayscale image derived from the selected color channel, which is essential for subsequent image analysis processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available options for the channel parameter in the imageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The available options for the channel parameter in the imageToMask node are 'red', 'green', and 'blue'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the imageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the imageToMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the imageToMask node handle invalid channel options?",
        "answer": "If an invalid channel option is provided, the imageToMask node raises a ValueError with the message 'Invalid channel option. Please choose 'red', 'green', or 'blue'."
