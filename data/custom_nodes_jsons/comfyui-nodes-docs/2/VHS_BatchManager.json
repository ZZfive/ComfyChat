        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the BatchManager node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the BatchManager node is to efficiently manage and organize frame batches for video processing tasks, ensuring the processing pipeline remains efficient and smooth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'frames_per_batch' parameter in the BatchManager node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames_per_batch' parameter determines the number of frames to be processed in each batch. It is crucial for controlling workload and memory usage, directly impacting the performance and efficiency of the video processing system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'prompt' parameter play in the BatchManager node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter provides additional instructions or context that may be needed for batch processing. It can influence how the BatchManager node interprets and handles input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'unique_id' parameter contribute to the functionality of the BatchManager node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is used to identify specific batches within the system, ensuring that the processing process can be accurately tracked and managed. It plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and organization of the batch processing workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'meta_batch' output provide in the BatchManager node?",
        "answer": "The 'meta_batch' output provides a structured representation of the processed batches, encapsulating results and metadata. It serves as a key checkpoint for further analysis or downstream processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the BatchManager node use?",
        "answer": "The BatchManager node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'reset' method in the BatchManager class?",
        "answer": "The 'reset' method in the BatchManager class is used to close inputs and reinitialize the BatchManager instance with the specified 'frames_per_batch' value, ensuring a clean state for new processing tasks."
