        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatAbsolute node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatAbsolute node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the absolute value of a given floating-point number, effectively removing any negative signs to ensure the result is a non-negative number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the JWFloatAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the JWFloatAbsolute node is a floating-point number, represented by the 'value' parameter, which allows the node to handle both positive and negative numbers and convert them to their corresponding non-negative values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the input 'value' parameter of the JWFloatAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input 'value' parameter of the JWFloatAbsolute node is FLOAT, and the corresponding Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the JWFloatAbsolute node output?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatAbsolute node outputs the non-negative absolute value of the input floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the output of the JWFloatAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the JWFloatAbsolute node is FLOAT, and the corresponding Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is JWFloatAbsolute an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWFloatAbsolute node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWFloatAbsolute node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWFloatAbsolute node is CPU."
