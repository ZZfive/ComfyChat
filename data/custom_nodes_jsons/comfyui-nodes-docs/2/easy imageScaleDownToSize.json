        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageScaleDownToSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageScaleDownToSize node is designed to scale an image to a specified size while maintaining its aspect ratio and ensuring the scaled image fits the desired dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the imageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the imageScaleDownToSize node are 'images' (numpy.ndarray) and 'size' (int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter determine in the imageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter determines the target size to which the input image will be scaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the imageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the imageScaleDownToSize node is 'mode' (boolean)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' parameter affect the scaling in the imageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter affects whether the scaling is based on the maximum or minimum dimension of the image, influencing the final aspect ratio and scaling direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the imageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the imageScaleDownToSize node is 'output_image' (numpy.ndarray), which represents the resized input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the imageScaleDownToSize node use?",
        "answer": "The imageScaleDownToSize node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
