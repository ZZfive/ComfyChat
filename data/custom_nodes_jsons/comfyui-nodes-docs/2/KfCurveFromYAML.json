        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the KfCurveFromYAML node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the KfCurveFromYAML node is to parse a YAML-formatted string to generate a keyframed curve, which is an essential component in animation and simulation workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfCurveFromYAML node simplify the creation process of motion paths?",
        "answer": "The KfCurveFromYAML node simplifies the creation process of motion paths by allowing users to define complex motion paths through a text-based format, making it easier to use and enhancing the modularity of the design process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'yaml' parameter in the KfCurveFromYAML node?",
        "answer": "The 'yaml' parameter in the KfCurveFromYAML node is a string that contains a YAML-formatted description of the curve. It is crucial as it directly defines the structure and characteristics of the curve to be generated, specifying the keyframes and interpolation methods used in the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'yaml' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'yaml' parameter is of the STRING data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the KfCurveFromYAML node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfCurveFromYAML node is a data structure representing the keyframed curve defined by the input YAML. It encapsulates the motion path with keyframes, interpolation, and other attributes, becoming a fundamental element for subsequent operations in an animation or simulation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output 'curve' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the output 'curve' is of the KEYFRAMED_CURVE data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfCurveFromYAML node run on?",
        "answer": "The KfCurveFromYAML node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
