        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN_concat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN_concat node is designed to concatenate three input strings using a specified delimiter, enabling flexible string manipulation and combination in text processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ttN_concat node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ttN_concat node are text1, text2, text3, and delimiter, all of which are of the STRING data type in ComfyUI and str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ttN_concat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ttN_concat node is a single STRING value in ComfyUI and str value in Python, representing the concatenated result of text1, text2, and text3 using the specified delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ttN_concat node support multiline input for the text fields?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ttN_concat node supports multiline input for the text1, text2, and text3 fields, allowing it to handle complex text inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the delimiter input in the ttN_concat node be a newline character?",
        "answer": "Yes, the delimiter input in the ttN_concat node can be a newline character ('\\n'), which will be converted to an actual newline character ('&#92;n') in the output."
