        "question": "What is the primary function of the `load_checkpoint` method in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `load_checkpoint` method is designed to load and manage pretrained models from a specified directory. It intelligently traverses the file system to locate and load the required models, ensuring that necessary components like VAE and CLIP are also available if needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `model_path` parameter in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `model_path` parameter is crucial for identifying the specific model to be loaded from the file system. It guides the node to the correct location, enabling the retrieval and use of the model's data and structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `output_vae` parameter determine in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `output_vae` parameter determines whether the variational autoencoder (VAE) component of the model should be loaded along with the main model. Including or excluding the VAE can be a strategic choice depending on the specific requirements of the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `output_clip` parameter in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `output_clip` parameter controls the loading of the CLIP component, which is typically used for image-text matching tasks. Enabling or disabling this parameter can influence the node's ability to perform such tasks, depending on the application's needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `MODEL` output represent in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `MODEL` output represents the core structure of the loaded model and is the main component for executing machine learning tasks. It encapsulates the model's architecture and learned parameters, making it the fundamental output for any subsequent model-based operations in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `NAME_STRING` output in the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The `NAME_STRING` output provides the basic name of the loaded model, which is useful for logging, identification, or reference within the application. It serves as a human-readable label that can help track and manage the model's usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Diffusers_Loader class is CPU."
