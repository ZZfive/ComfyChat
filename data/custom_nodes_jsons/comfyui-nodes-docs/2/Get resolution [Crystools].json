    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the 'Get resolution' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Get resolution' node requires an input type of 'image', which is the image whose resolution needs to be determined. It serves as the primary data source for extracting dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'Get resolution' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Get resolution' node outputs the 'width' and 'height' of the image in pixels, along with a 'ui' element that displays the image resolution in text format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the 'Get resolution' node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the 'Get resolution' node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
