        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Blank node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Blank node is designed to generate a blank image with specified dimensions and color. It plays a crucial role in creating a visual canvas for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Blank node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Blank node are 'width', 'height', 'red', 'green', and 'blue'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' parameter affect the generated blank image?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter defines the horizontal dimension of the blank image to be generated. It is essential for setting the image's size and influencing the overall composition and layout of any subsequent image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'red' parameter in the WAS_Image_Blank node?",
        "answer": "The 'red' parameter specifies the intensity of the red channel in the blank image. It is a key component in determining the overall color of the image. By adjusting the 'red' value, users can create images with specific red tints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the WAS_Image_Blank node provide?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Blank node provides an 'IMAGE' output, which represents the generated blank image with specified dimensions and color. This output serves as the foundation layer for any subsequent image operations or processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the WAS_Image_Blank node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Image_Blank node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Image_Blank node's source code ensure the generated image dimensions are divisible by 8?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'width' and 'height' values are adjusted to be divisible by 8 using the floor division operator (//) and multiplication (*) before creating the blank image."
