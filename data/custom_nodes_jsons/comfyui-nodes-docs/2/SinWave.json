        "question": "What is the purpose of the SinWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SinWave node in ComfyUI is designed to generate sine wave patterns. It simulates the behavior of waves by calculating the y position for a given frame based on provided parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the phase parameter in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter determines the period of the wave. It is crucial as it dictates the frequency of oscillations, thereby influencing the overall shape and pattern of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the wave in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter sets the peak value of the wave, controlling the height of the oscillations. It is a key parameter that affects the intensity of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the current_frame parameter specify in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter specifies the frame at which to perform the wave calculation. It is essential for determining the y position of the wave at a particular point in time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the x_translation parameter in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The x_translation parameter allows the wave to be moved horizontally along the X-axis. This can be used to adjust the position of the waveform to meet specific design requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the y_translation parameter affect the wave in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The y_translation parameter is responsible for moving the wave vertically along the Y-axis, allowing the starting point of the wave to be adjusted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two output types of the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The SinWave node outputs two values: 'output' which represents the calculated y position of the wave for the current frame, and 'int_output' which is the y position converted to an integer, useful in scenarios requiring discrete values."
