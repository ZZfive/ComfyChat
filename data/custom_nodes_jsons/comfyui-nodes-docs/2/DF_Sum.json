        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Sum node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node in ComfyUI is designed to perform arithmetic addition operations. It takes two floating-point number inputs and returns their sum as the floating-point output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node requires two input values: Value_A and Value_B. Both are of the FLOAT data type in Comfy and float data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Sum node is a float, which represents the sum of the two input values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of Value_A in the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "Value_A represents one of the two values to be added in the DF_Sum node. It is crucial as it directly affects the outcome of the sum calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of Value_B in the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "Value_B serves as the second value to be added to the first value in the DF_Sum node. Its importance lies in its contribution to the total sum, influencing the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the DF_Sum node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node belongs to the Derfuu_Nodes/Math category."
