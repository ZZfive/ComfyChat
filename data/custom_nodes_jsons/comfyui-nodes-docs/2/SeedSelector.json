        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeedSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeedSelector node in ComfyUI is designed to select a seed value for procedural generation tasks, allowing users to switch between random and fixed seed modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the advantage of using a fixed seed in the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "Using a fixed seed in the SeedSelector node ensures the reproducibility of the generated results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the advantage of using a random seed in the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "Using a random seed in the SeedSelector node generates a variety of results in procedural generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeedSelector node are 'mode' (BOOLEAN), 'seed' (INT), and 'fixed_seed' (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input determine in the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the SeedSelector node determines whether the seed selection is random or fixed, affecting the reproducibility and variability of the generated results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeedSelector node is 'seed' (INT), which is the selected seed value used for procedural generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the SeedSelector node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SeedSelector node is CPU."
