        "question": "What is the role of the output_folder parameter in CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The output_folder parameter specifies the directory where the image frames will be saved. This is crucial for organizing the output and ensuring that frames are stored in the correct location."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the current_image parameter used in CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The current_image parameter represents the current frame image to be saved. It is the basic input for the node's operation as it is the actual content that will be written to the file system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the current_frame parameter important in CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter indicates the frame number currently being processed. It is essential for naming and sorting the saved images in a sequence that reflects the processing order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the filename_prefix parameter in CR_OutputFlowFrames do?",
        "answer": "The filename_prefix parameter is used to define the starting part of the filenames of the saved images. It helps create a consistent naming convention for the output files, which can be beneficial for later identification and processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the interpolated_img parameter enhance the functionality of CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The interpolated_img parameter provides the option to include interpolated images in the output. This can enhance the visual transition between frames, providing a smoother animation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What flexibility does the output_path parameter offer in CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The output_path parameter allows specifying an alternative path to save images, overriding the default output directory. It provides flexibility in managing the storage location of output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information is contained in the ui parameter of the output in CR_OutputFlowFrames?",
        "answer": "The ui parameter in the output contains information about the saved images, including their filenames, subfolder locations, and output type. This data can be used for user interface display or further processing."
