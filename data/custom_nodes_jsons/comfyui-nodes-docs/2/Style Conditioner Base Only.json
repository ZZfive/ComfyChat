        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'add_style' method in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'add_style' method in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node is designed to integrate user-defined styles into the conditioning process. It allows applying style preferences by combining positive and negative prompts with base conditioning elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'style' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'style' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node plays a key role in determining the style direction of the conditioning process. It decides the specific positive and negative prompts that will be used to guide the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node influence the conditioning process?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node controls the intensity of the style influence applied to the conditioning process. It is a float value that adjusts the weight of the style influence, allowing for fine-tuning of style elements in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'positive_cond_base' parameter play in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_cond_base' parameter represents the base positive conditioning element that will be affected by the style influence. It is a crucial component in the node operation as it forms the basis for applying style adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'negative_cond_base' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_cond_base' parameter is the base negative conditioning element that will be influenced by the style. It plays an important role in shaping the output by providing a counterbalance to the positive conditioning, thus forming a contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_seed' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'use_seed' parameter determines whether a seed value should be used to select a style from the available options. When set to 'true', it introduces a randomness element into the style selection process, which can be beneficial for diversifying the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seed' parameter in the StyleConditionerBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used in conjunction with the 'use_seed' parameter to control the randomness in style selection. It provides a specific reference point for the random number generator, ensuring a repeatable selection process when randomness is involved."
