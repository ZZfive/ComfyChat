        "question": "What is the purpose of the Text Concatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate node in ComfyUI is designed to merge multiple text inputs into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate the texts. This functionality is essential for creating concatenated strings from various inputs, allowing flexible text manipulation and aggregation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the Text Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Text Concatenate node is the delimiter, which specifies the type of delimiter used to separate the text inputs, such as space or comma. The optional input types are text1, text2, text3, text4, and text5, which are the text inputs to be concatenated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Text Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Text Concatenate node is a string, which is the resulting string after concatenating the given text inputs using the specified delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Text Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Text Concatenate node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Text Concatenate node determine the delimiter to use between text inputs?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate node determines the delimiter to use between text inputs based on the value of the delimiter parameter. If the delimiter is set to 'space', a space character is used. If the delimiter is set to 'comma', a comma followed by a space is used."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Text Concatenate node handle empty or missing text inputs?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate node only concatenates non-empty text inputs. If a text input is empty or missing, it is skipped, and the node continues with the next available text input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Text Concatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Text Concatenate node in ComfyUI is JPS Nodes/Text."
