        "question": "What is the purpose of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is a specialized processor for semantic segmentation tasks. It belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors category and uses the UniformerSegmentor model to process images, aiming to understand and segment the image into different semantic regions based on learned representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image that needs to be semantically segmented. This parameter is crucial as it serves as the main data source for the model to perform the segmentation operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing. This affects the level of detail in the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which is the output of the semantic segmentation process. It is an image that has been segmented into different semantic regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The category of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node perform semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "The UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node performs semantic segmentation by using the UniformerSegmentor model. It calls the 'common_annotator_call' function with the model, image, and resolution as parameters to perform the segmentation operation."
