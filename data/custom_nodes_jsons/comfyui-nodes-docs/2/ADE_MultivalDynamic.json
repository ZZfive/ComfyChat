        "question": "What is the purpose of the MultivalDynamicNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MultivalDynamicNode class is designed to dynamically generate and manipulate multivalued data within animation frameworks. It is a key component in creating complex animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does the 'float_val' parameter accept?",
        "answer": "The 'float_val' parameter can accept either a single floating-point number or an iterable of floating-point numbers, providing flexibility in different aspects of animation scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask_optional' parameter enhance the functionality of the MultivalDynamicNode?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_optional' parameter allows selective application of 'float_val' to different elements of the animation. It enables conditional or partial animation effects, adding depth to the final animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'multival' output in the MultivalDynamicNode?",
        "answer": "The 'multival' output represents the processed multivalued data ready for use in the animation pipeline. It forms the basis for further animation development and can be directly integrated into the rendering process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the MultivalDynamicNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the MultivalDynamicNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'create_multival' method handle different types of 'float_val' inputs?",
        "answer": "The 'create_multival' method intelligently handles both single and iterable 'float_val' inputs, ensuring the output format is suitable for downstream processing. It converts the input into a tensor and applies the 'mask_optional' if provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'RETURN_TYPES' attribute in the MultivalDynamicNode class?",
        "answer": "The 'RETURN_TYPES' attribute specifies the type of output returned by the MultivalDynamicNode, which is 'MULTIVAL' in this case."
