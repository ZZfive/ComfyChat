        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node in ComfyUI filters images based on specified indexes, ensuring that only the required subset of images is processed further, improving the efficiency and focus of image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageSelector node is 'images', which is of Comfy data type IMAGE and Python data type torch.Tensor. This parameter is crucial as it determines the dataset from which the selection will be made."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ImageSelector node is 'selected_indexes', which is of Comfy data type STRING and Python data type str. This parameter allows users to define specific indexes of the images they wish to select, directly influencing the images that will undergo further operations through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageSelector node is 'selected_images', which represents the filtered subset of images based on the provided indexes, now ready for further processing or analysis. It is of Comfy data type IMAGE and Python data type torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageSelector node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageSelector node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageSelector node is not an output node. It is an intermediate node used for processing and filtering images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImageSelector node belong?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node belongs to the 'motionctrl' category."
