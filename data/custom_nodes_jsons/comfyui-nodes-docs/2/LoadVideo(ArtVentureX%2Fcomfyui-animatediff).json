        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadVideo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadVideo node in ComfyUI is designed to extract frames from a video file, allowing for the selection of a specific range of frames based on a starting point and limit. It makes these frames available for further processing in various applications such as animation or difference analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'video' parameter in the LoadVideo node?",
        "answer": "The 'video' parameter is essential as it defines the source from which frames will be extracted. It influences the operation of the node by determining what content and sequence of frames will be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_start' parameter affect the operation of the LoadVideo node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_start' parameter indicates the initial frame number from which extraction should begin. It affects the execution of the node by setting the starting point for frame selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'frame_limit' parameter play in the LoadVideo node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_limit' parameter defines the maximum number of frames to be extracted after the 'frame_start'. It directly influences the number of frames processed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frames' output from the LoadVideo node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' output is a series of extracted video frames converted into tensor format, which is crucial for further analysis or manipulation in downstream processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'frame_count' output from the LoadVideo node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_count' output provides the total number of frames extracted, offering a reference for the amount of data processed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the LoadVideo node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LoadVideo node is CPU."
