        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec3BinaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec3BinaryCondition node in ComfyUI is designed to perform binary operations on two three-dimensional vectors. It evaluates the condition specified by the 'op' parameter and returns a Boolean result indicating whether the condition holds for the given vectors 'a' and 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter define in the Vec3BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec3BinaryCondition node defines the type of binary condition to be evaluated. It is crucial as it determines the specific operation that will be executed on the input vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the Vec3BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec3BinaryCondition node represents the first three-dimensional vector involved in the binary operation. Its values significantly influence the result of the condition evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'b' parameter in the Vec3BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter in the Vec3BinaryCondition node represents the second three-dimensional vector in the binary operation. It works together with 'a' to determine the outcome of the condition check."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the Vec3BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the Vec3BinaryCondition node is a Boolean value indicating whether the binary condition specified by the 'op' parameter is satisfied by the input vectors 'a' and 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec3BinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec3BinaryCondition node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the Vec3BinaryCondition node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The Vec3BinaryCondition node is implemented as a class with methods defining its input and return types, as well as the operation to be performed. The class includes the 'op' function which takes the 'op', 'a', and 'b' parameters and returns a tuple containing the result of the binary condition evaluation."
