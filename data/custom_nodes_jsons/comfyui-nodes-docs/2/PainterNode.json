        "question": "What is the purpose of the PainterNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PainterNode in ComfyUI is designed to process images by applying transformations and generating corresponding masks if applicable. It focuses on preparing images for further processing or visualization, including adjusting image format, orientation, and proportions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the PainterNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the PainterNode is 'image', which specifies the image file to be processed. It is crucial in determining the input image for transformation and potential mask generation, directly affecting the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PainterNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PainterNode in ComfyUI are 'image' and 'mask'. The 'image' output represents a transformed and appropriately formatted version of the input image, prepared for further processing or visualization. The 'mask' output provides a mask related to the input image, useful for various image processing tasks that require distinguishing between the image's foreground and background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Comfy dtype' for the 'image' input parameter in PainterNode?",
        "answer": "The 'Comfy dtype' for the 'image' input parameter in PainterNode is COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Python dtype' for the 'image' output in PainterNode?",
        "answer": "The 'Python dtype' for the 'image' output in PainterNode is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the PainterNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the PainterNode is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with PainterNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with PainterNode in ComfyUI are Image Batch and ImageScale."
