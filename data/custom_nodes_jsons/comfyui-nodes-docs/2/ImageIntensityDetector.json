        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node is used to preprocess images by adjusting their intensity levels through gamma correction, enhancing the overall visibility and contrast of the image before further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the image in the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The input type for the image in the ImageIntensityDetector node is IMAGE (Comfy dtype) or numpy.ndarray (Python dtype)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the gamma_correction parameter do in the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The gamma_correction parameter specifies the gamma correction factor used to adjust the image intensity. Higher values make the image brighter, while lower values make it darker, significantly affecting the visual quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the gamma_correction parameter in the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the gamma_correction parameter in the ImageIntensityDetector node is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the resolution parameter do in the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The resolution parameter determines the resolution at which the image is resized before applying the intensity adjustment, affecting the level of detail in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageIntensityDetector node is an IMAGE (Comfy dtype) or numpy.ndarray (Python dtype), which represents the image with adjusted intensity levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImageIntensityDetector node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category in ComfyUI."
