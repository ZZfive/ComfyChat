        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec3BinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec3BinaryOperation node is designed to perform binary operations on two three-dimensional vectors. It is a fundamental building block for vector math, allowing operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter specify in the Vec3BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter specifies the binary operation to be performed on the input vectors. It is a key from a predefined set of vector operations and is crucial for determining the type of calculation the node will execute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two required input vectors for the Vec3BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The two required input vectors for the Vec3BinaryOperation node are 'a' and 'b'. They are the first and second three-dimensional vectors involved in the binary operation, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Vec3BinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Vec3BinaryOperation node is 'result', which is the three-dimensional vector resulting from the binary operation performed on input vectors 'a' and 'b'. It contains the outcome of the vector calculation and directly reflects the specified operation 'op'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Vec3BinaryOperation node use?",
        "answer": "The Vec3BinaryOperation node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Vec3BinaryOperation node classified?",
        "answer": "The Vec3BinaryOperation node is classified in the 'math/vec3' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Vec3BinaryOperation node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the Vec3BinaryOperation node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
