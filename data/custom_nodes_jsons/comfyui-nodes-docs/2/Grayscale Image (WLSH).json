        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is designed to convert color images to grayscale images, which is a basic operation in image processing. It reduces the complexity of the image by removing color information, allowing focus on the structure and brightness aspects of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is the original image, which is essential for the grayscale conversion process. The quality and resolution of the original image directly affect the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the input for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input of the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is the grayscale version of the input image, processed to focus on brightness and structural details without the interference of color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the output for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node?",
        "answer": "The return type for the WLSH_Image_Grayscale node is IMAGE, and the return name is 'grayscale'."
