        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatToSigmas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatToSigmas node in ComfyUI converts a list of floating-point values into a sigma tensor, which is a format suitable for noise generation and manipulation in neural networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the FloatToSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FloatToSigmas node is a list of floating-point values (float_list), which is essential for defining the specific noise levels to be applied during neural network processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FloatToSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FloatToSigmas node is a sigma tensor (SIGMAS) derived from the input list of floating-point values, which is used for noise generation and manipulation in neural network operations."
