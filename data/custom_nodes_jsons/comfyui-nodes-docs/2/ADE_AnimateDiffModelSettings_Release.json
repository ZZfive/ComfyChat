        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node is designed to configure the motion model settings in the AnimateDiff process, with an emphasis on advanced attention intensity adjustments. It aims to provide users with the ability to fine-tune the animation effects applied through the AnimateDiff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node are min_motion_scale and max_motion_scale, both of which are of Comfy dtype FLOAT and Python dtype float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the min_motion_scale input specify in the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The min_motion_scale input specifies the minimum scale of motion, affecting the subtlety or intensity of the animation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the max_motion_scale input define in the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The max_motion_scale input defines the maximum scale of motion, affecting the range of motion intensity that can be applied to the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node is mask_motion_scale, which is of Comfy dtype MASK and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mask_motion_scale input allow in the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The mask_motion_scale input allows for fine-grained control of motion scaling over different regions of the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node is ad_settings, which is of Comfy dtype AD_SETTINGS and Python dtype AnimateDiffSettings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release node is a configuration set for the AnimateDiff model, containing adjustments to motion scale and potentially other parameters."
