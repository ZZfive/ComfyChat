        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntToNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntToNumber node in ComfyUI converts an integer input into a numerical format suitable for further processing, emphasizing the importance of data type conversion in computational workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the parameter 'a' in the IntToNumber node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'a' in the IntToNumber node expects an INT data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to the int data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IntToNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the IntToNumber node is the numerical representation of the input integer, which is crucial for subsequent operations that require numerical data. The output type is NUMBER in ComfyUI and int in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the IntToNumber node require any specific infrastructure type to run?",
        "answer": "Yes, the IntToNumber node is designated to run on CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the input parameter 'a' in the IntToNumber node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the input parameter 'a' in the IntToNumber node is 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the IntToNumber node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the IntToNumber node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the conversion from integer to number performed in the IntToNumber node?",
        "answer": "The conversion from integer to number in the IntToNumber node is performed by simply returning the input integer 'a' as the result, indicating that the conversion is direct."
