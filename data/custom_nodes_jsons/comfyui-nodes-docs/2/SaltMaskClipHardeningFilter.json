        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node in ComfyUI applies a clipping hardening filter to the mask area, enhancing its edges and details through sharpening processing. It allows adjusting the intensity to control the strength of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node is 'masks', which are the masks to be processed for enhancing their clarity and definition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node is 'strength', which controls the intensity of the sharpening effect applied to the masks. A higher value results in a more pronounced effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node is 'MASKS', which are the masks that have been processed through the clipping hardening filter, with enhanced edges and details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'strength' parameter in the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'strength' parameter in the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node is 1.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node apply the sharpening effect to the masks?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskClipHardeningFilter node applies the sharpening effect to the masks using a kernel matrix and the cv2.filter2D function. The kernel matrix is adjusted based on the 'strength' parameter to control the intensity of the sharpening effect."
