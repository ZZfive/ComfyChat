        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend class in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly blend a source image into a target image within specified boundaries, creating a smooth transition between the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the bounded_image_blend method?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the bounded_image_blend method are the target image, target bounds, and source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be used to adjust the blending in the bounded_image_blend method?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters that can be used to adjust the blending in the bounded_image_blend method are the blend_factor and feathering."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the blend_factor affect the blending of the source and target images?",
        "answer": "The blend_factor determines the degree of transparency of the source image within the blending area, affecting the opacity of the source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does increasing the feathering value do to the blended image?",
        "answer": "Increasing the feathering value results in a more gradual blend between the source and target images at the edges of the blending region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Bounded_Image_Blend node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the bounded_image_blend method?",
        "answer": "The output of the bounded_image_blend method is the resulting image that represents the blended combination of the source and target images within the specified boundaries."
