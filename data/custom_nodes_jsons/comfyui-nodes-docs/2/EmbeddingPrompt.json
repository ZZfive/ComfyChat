        "question": "What is the purpose of the EmbeddingPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EmbeddingPrompt node in ComfyUI is used to generate prompts based on embeddings and their associated weights, allowing users to adjust the influence of specific embeddings in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the EmbeddingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the EmbeddingPrompt node is the 'embedding' parameter, which selects the base context or topic for generating the prompt from a list of available embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight' parameter in the EmbeddingPrompt node control?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in the EmbeddingPrompt node adjusts the influence of the selected embedding on the final prompt, allowing fine control over emphasizing the embedding context in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the EmbeddingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the EmbeddingPrompt node is a 'prompt', which is a string that integrates the selected embedding and its weight into a concise and targeted statement that can be used as input for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the EmbeddingPrompt node utilize?",
        "answer": "The EmbeddingPrompt node utilizes the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the EmbeddingPrompt node classified?",
        "answer": "The EmbeddingPrompt node is classified in the '♾️Mixlab/Prompt' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the EmbeddingPrompt node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the EmbeddingPrompt node is not an output node. It is a node used for generating prompts based on embeddings and weights."
