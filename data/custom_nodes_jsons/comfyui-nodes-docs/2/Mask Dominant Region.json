        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class in ComfyUI is designed to identify and isolate the most prominent region in a given mask image. It processes the input image to highlight the largest contiguous area based on a specified threshold, making it particularly suitable for applications that focus on the main subject or feature in an image, such as image segmentation or feature extraction tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'masks' input parameter in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter is crucial for the operation of the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class as it defines the image data to be processed. The node relies on this input to identify the dominant region in the image, making it a key component that directly affects the execution of the node's functionality and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'threshold' parameter influence the visibility of seams in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter plays an important role in determining the visibility of seams in the image. By adjusting the threshold, users can control the balance between the visibility of seams and the resulting image size, which is crucial for applications that require seamless textures or patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class is the processed image data where the dominant region has been identified and isolated. This output is important as it provides the result of the node's operation, which can be further utilized in downstream processes or applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for running the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for running the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'threshold' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'threshold' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class is 128."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the 'threshold' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'threshold' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Dominant_Region class is 0, and the maximum value is 255."
