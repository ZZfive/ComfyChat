        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node is designed to load AnimateDiff models, facilitating the integration and application of motion models within the AnimateDiff framework for animation purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node is the 'model_name', which specifies the name of the motion model to be loaded. This is crucial as it determines which motion model will be used for animation within the AnimateDiff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node is 'ad_settings', which allows for the inclusion of specific animation settings, providing additional customization and control over the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node is the loaded motion model, ready for further processing and application in the animation pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node in ComfyUI is 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'load_motion_model' function in the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node do?",
        "answer": "The 'load_motion_model' function in the ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel node loads the motion module and motion settings (if included) based on the provided 'model_name' and 'ad_settings' inputs, and returns the loaded motion model."
