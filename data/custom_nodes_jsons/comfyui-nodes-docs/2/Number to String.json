        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Number_To_String node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_To_String node in ComfyUI is designed to convert numeric values into their corresponding string representations. It plays a crucial role in data preprocessing and conversion workflows, enabling numeric data to be seamlessly integrated into systems that require text input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the WAS_Number_To_String node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the WAS_Number_To_String node is 'number'. This parameter is essential for the node's operation as it determines the content of the output string by being the numeric input that needs to be converted into a string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'number' input parameter in the WAS_Number_To_String node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'number' input parameter in the WAS_Number_To_String node is NUMBER."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Number_To_String node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Number_To_String node is 'string'. This output parameter represents the textual form of the input number and is important as it provides the converted data that can be used for various downstream applications or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'string' output parameter in the WAS_Number_To_String node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'string' output parameter in the WAS_Number_To_String node is STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Number_To_String node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Number_To_String node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the number_to_string function in the WAS_Number_To_String node do?",
        "answer": "The number_to_string function in the WAS_Number_To_String node converts the input number into a string and returns it."
