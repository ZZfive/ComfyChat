        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Build_Filename_String node generates a unique filename string by combining a timestamp, model name, seed, and counter into a customizable template, creating recognizable and organized filenames for various applications."

    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node is the 'filename' parameter, which serves as the base name upon which the final filename is built and acts as the template for inserting other parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node include 'modelname' (the name of the model to be incorporated into the filename), 'seed' (a numeric value to increase diversity and uniqueness of the filename), 'counter' (an integer used to create a sequence of filenames when used with the same base filename and parameters), and 'time_format' (defines the format of the timestamp inserted into the filename)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node is a formatted string representing the constructed filename containing all provided parameters."

    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'time_format' parameter in the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'time_format' parameter in the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node is '%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WLSH_Build_Filename_String node create a sequence of filenames?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Build_Filename_String node creates a sequence of filenames by using the 'counter' parameter, which is an integer that helps generate a series of filenames when used with the same base filename and other parameters."
