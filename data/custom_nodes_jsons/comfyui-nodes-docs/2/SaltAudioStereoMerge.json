        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioStereoMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioStereoMerge node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two mono audio inputs into a single stereo audio output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioStereoMerge node ensure the two audio inputs are of the same length?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioStereoMerge node finds the minimum length between the two audio inputs and truncates both inputs to this minimum length before merging them into a stereo track."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltAudioStereoMerge node do if the input audio tracks are not already mono?",
        "answer": "If the input audio tracks are not already mono, the SaltAudioStereoMerge node converts them to mono before merging them into a stereo track."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioStereoMerge node are `audio_a` and `audio_b`, both of which are of the Comfy dtype `AUDIO` and Python dtype `bytes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioStereoMerge node is `audio`, which is of the Comfy dtype `AUDIO` and Python dtype `bytes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltAudioStereoMerge node is `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltAudioStereoMerge node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioStereoMerge node belongs to the `SALT/Audio/Effect` category in ComfyUI."
