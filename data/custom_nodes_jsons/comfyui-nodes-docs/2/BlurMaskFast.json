        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlurMaskFast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BlurMaskFast node is used to apply Gaussian blur to masks in order to soften edges and create a smoother mask appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BlurMaskFast node are: masks (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), radius_x (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and radius_y (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the radius_x parameter determine in the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The radius_x parameter determines the horizontal radius of the Gaussian blur. A larger radius will produce a more noticeable blurring effect in the horizontal direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the radius_y parameter determine in the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The radius_y parameter determines the vertical radius of the Gaussian blur. A larger radius will produce a more noticeable blurring effect in the vertical direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BlurMaskFast node is a mask (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) that has been processed with Gaussian blur, resulting in softer edges compared to the original mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the BlurMaskFast node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BlurMaskFast node do when the sum of radius_x and radius_y is zero?",
        "answer": "When the sum of radius_x and radius_y is zero, the BlurMaskFast node returns the original masks without applying any blurring effect."
