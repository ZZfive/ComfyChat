        "question": "What is the purpose of the `ImageBatchCopy` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchCopy` node is designed to copy specific images within a batch of images a specified number of times, with the aim of adjusting the composition of the image batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the `ImageBatchCopy` node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the `ImageBatchCopy` node are `images`, which specifies the group of images to be processed; `index`, which indicates the position of the image to be copied within the batch; and `quantity`, which defines the number of times the selected image should be replicated within the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `ImageBatchCopy` node output?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchCopy` node outputs data of the `IMAGE` type, returning a new batch of images in which the specific image has been copied the specified number of times, thus altering the composition of the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `ImageBatchCopy` node change the composition of an image batch?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchCopy` node changes the composition of an image batch by increasing the number of specific images within the batch, thereby diversifying or enlarging the dataset for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `index` parameter in the `ImageBatchCopy` node specify?",
        "answer": "The `index` parameter in the `ImageBatchCopy` node specifies the position of the image to be copied within the batch, which is crucial for selecting the specific image that needs to be replicated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `quantity` parameter in the `ImageBatchCopy` node define?",
        "answer": "The `quantity` parameter in the `ImageBatchCopy` node defines the number of times the selected image should be replicated within the batch, directly affecting the size of the output batch by increasing the number of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What hardware type is recommended for running the `ImageBatchCopy` node?",
        "answer": "The recommended hardware type for running the `ImageBatchCopy` node is GPU."
