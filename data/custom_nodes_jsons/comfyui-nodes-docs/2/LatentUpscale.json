        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentUpscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentUpscale node in ComfyUI is designed to improve the quality and detail of generated images by increasing the resolution of input latent samples through different upscaling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LatentUpscale node are 'samples' (of type LATENT), 'upscale_method' (of type COMBO), 'width' (of type INT), 'height' (of type INT), and 'crop' (of type COMBO)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'upscale_method' parameter influence the image upscaling process in LatentUpscale?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_method' parameter determines the algorithm used to upscale the latent samples. It significantly affects the efficiency and visual outcome of the upscaling process, providing varying levels of detail and smoothness to the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do the 'width' and 'height' parameters play in the LatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' and 'height' parameters specify the desired dimensions of the upscaled output. They are crucial in establishing the image's size, which affects the overall aesthetics and composition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'crop' parameter affect the output in LatentUpscale?",
        "answer": "The 'crop' parameter determines how the node handles the centering of the upscaled image. It influences the positioning and framing of the output, ensuring that the generated image is properly aligned and focused."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the LatentUpscale node contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentUpscale node contains the upscaled latent representation, now with a higher resolution and more detail. This output is essential as it serves as the basis for subsequent image processing or analysis steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the LatentUpscale node is GPU."
