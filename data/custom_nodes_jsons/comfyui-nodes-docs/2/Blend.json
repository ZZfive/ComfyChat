        "question": "What is the purpose of the Blend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Blend node in ComfyUI is used to combine two images using different blending modes and adjust the final output based on a specified factor to create composite visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Blend node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Blend node are: image1 (the main image that serves as the base layer), image2 (the secondary image that interacts with the base image), blend_factor (a parameter that controls the influence of the overlay image), and blend_mode (determines the blending mode used to combine the images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blend_factor parameter control in the Blend node?",
        "answer": "The blend_factor parameter in the Blend node controls the influence of the overlay image in the final blend. Higher values make the overlay image more dominant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available blending modes in the Blend node?",
        "answer": "The available blending modes in the Blend node are: normal, multiply, screen, overlay, and soft_light."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Blend node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Blend node is a blended_image, which represents the harmonious fusion of the input images according to the specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Blend node handle images with different shapes?",
        "answer": "If the two input images have different shapes, the Blend node crops and resizes the second image to match the shape of the first image using the crop_and_resize function."
    },
