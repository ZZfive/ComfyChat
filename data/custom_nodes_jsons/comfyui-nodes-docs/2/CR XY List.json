        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_XYList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYList node in ComfyUI is designed to perform a cross-join operation on two lists, generating a combined grid. It allows adding prefix and suffix strings to list elements, enhancing output flexibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_XYList node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_XYList node are 'index' (INT), 'list1' (STRING), and 'list2' (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' parameter do in the CR_XYList node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is crucial for determining the position of the current combination in the grid. It influences the node's execution by deciding which elements from the input lists are selected for output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters does the CR_XYList node have?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYList node has optional parameters: 'x_prepend', 'x_append', 'x_annotation_prepend', 'y_prepend', 'y_append', and 'y_annotation_prepend', all of which are of the STRING data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'x_prepend' parameter in the CR_XYList node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_prepend' parameter in the CR_XYList node allows adding a prefix to each element in 'list1'. This can be used to customize the output format or add context to the elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_XYList node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYList node produces the following output types: 'X' (STRING), 'Y' (STRING), 'x_annotation' (STRING), 'y_annotation' (STRING), 'trigger' (BOOLEAN), and 'show_help' (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'trigger' output in the CR_XYList node indicate the completion of grid generation?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger' output in the CR_XYList node is a BOOLEAN data type that indicates when the grid generation is complete, marking the end of the cross-join process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_XYList node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYList node uses the CPU infra type."
