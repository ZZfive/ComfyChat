        "question": "What is the purpose of the Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Float node in ComfyUI is specifically used to handle numeric input, especially floating-point numbers, allowing precise control of decimal values in logical operations or calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Float node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Float node is 'value', which defines the floating-point number to be processed. This input is crucial for determining the node's operation and affects the accuracy and result of the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'value' input in the Float node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'value' input in the Float node is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'value' input in the Float node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'value' input in the Float node is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Float node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Float node is FLOAT, which outputs the processed floating-point number, maintaining the precision specified in the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the Float node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the Float node include SVD_img2vid_Conditioning, ezMath, KSampler Adv. (Efficient), Reroute, and workflow/IP Adapter full bundle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Float node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Float node is CPU."
