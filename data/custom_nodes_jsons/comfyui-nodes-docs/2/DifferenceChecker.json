        "question": "What is the purpose of the DifferenceChecker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DifferenceChecker node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the absolute difference between two sets of images and scale it by a specified multiplier, which is useful for highlighting differences or changes between two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DifferenceChecker node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DifferenceChecker node are 'images1' and 'images2' of Comfy dtype IMAGE, and 'multiplier' of Comfy dtype FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiplier' input do in the DifferenceChecker node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' input in the DifferenceChecker node is a scaling factor applied to the calculated difference, allowing for adjustment of the intensity of the differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DifferenceChecker node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DifferenceChecker node is an image or set of images representing the scaled absolute difference between the input images, with a Comfy dtype of IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DifferenceChecker node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DifferenceChecker node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DifferenceChecker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DifferenceChecker node belongs to the 'image/filters' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DifferenceChecker node calculate the difference between two images?",
        "answer": "The DifferenceChecker node calculates the absolute difference between two images using the formula `torch.abs(images1 - images2) * multiplier`, and then clamps the result between 0 and 1."
