        "question": "What is the purpose of the Automatic CFG - Negative node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG - Negative node in ComfyUI is used to apply dynamic configuration to the model for content generation, with a focus on enhancing the generation process by adjusting the model's behavior based on negative prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Automatic CFG - Negative node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Automatic CFG - Negative node are: model (MODEL), boost (BOOLEAN), and negative_strength (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boost' parameter do in the Automatic CFG - Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost' parameter in the Automatic CFG - Negative node determines whether to skip the unconditional generation step, effectively changing the model's generation process to focus more on the specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'negative_strength' parameter affect the model's behavior in the Automatic CFG - Negative node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_strength' parameter in the Automatic CFG - Negative node controls the strength of the negative condition, allowing fine-tuning of how the model should mitigate or ignore the specified negative aspects during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Automatic CFG - Negative node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Automatic CFG - Negative node is a modified model (MODEL) with applied dynamic configuration, specifically designed to enhance content generation by considering negative prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infratype is commonly used with the Automatic CFG - Negative node?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG - Negative node commonly uses the 'GPU' infratype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Automatic CFG - Negative node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Automatic CFG - Negative node in ComfyUI is 'model_patches/automatic_cfg/presets'."
