        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBilateralBlur node in ComfyUI applies a bilateral filter to an image, which is a process that reduces noise while keeping edges sharp. It achieves this effect by considering both spatial proximity and pixel value differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node are 'images', 'size', 'sigma_color', and 'sigma_intensity'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter control in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node specifies the diameter of the pixel neighborhood used in the filtering process. A larger size means more pixels will be considered for each target pixel, potentially resulting in a stronger smoothing effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sigma_color' parameter influence the bilateral filtering in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma_color' parameter controls the extent to which the color space of the image influences the bilateral filtering. Higher values allow pixels with larger intensity differences to influence each other."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sigma_intensity' parameter in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma_intensity' parameter determines the range of intensity (brightness) differences in the image that affect the bilateral filtering. Higher values result in more pixels influencing each other based on their intensity differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node is the processed image after applying the bilateral blur filter, which aims to reduce noise while preserving edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node run on?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBilateralBlur node runs on the GPU infrastructure type."
