        "question": "What is the purpose of the DPFeelingLucky node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DPFeelingLucky node aims to generate creative and potentially unexpected prompts by utilizing random seeds and the 'feeling lucky' method. It introduces variability and novelty into the sampling process, contributing to the diversity of the output results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' input parameter in the DPFeelingLucky node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input parameter is crucial for generating prompts. It provides context and content to the node, directly influencing the relevance and creativity of the generated prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter affect the output of the DPFeelingLucky node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter controls the randomness of the generated prompts. When the seed is fixed, the same input text will produce consistent results, which is useful for debugging and reproducibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'autorefresh' parameter in the DPFeelingLucky node?",
        "answer": "The 'autorefresh' parameter determines whether the node should automatically generate a new prompt based on changes in the input text. It affects the responsiveness of the node and the dynamics of the content generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'prompt' represent in the DPFeelingLucky node?",
        "answer": "The output 'prompt' is the result of the node's operation. It represents the creative and potentially novel content derived from the input text and the randomness introduced by the seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the DPFeelingLucky node use?",
        "answer": "The DPFeelingLucky node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'get_prompt' method in the DPFeelingLucky node?",
        "answer": "The 'get_prompt' method is the main entry point for the DPFeelingLucky node. It generates a new prompt using the sampling context, considering the input text, seed, and autorefresh parameters."
