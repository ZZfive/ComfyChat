        "question": "What is the purpose of the DynamicDelayProcessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DynamicDelayProcessor node is designed to introduce controllable delays into processes, allowing for adjustment of execution time based on input parameters. This provides flexibility for operations sensitive to processing time, especially in scenarios requiring synchronization of output generation with external events or controlling to match specific speeds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'delay_seconds' parameter in the DynamicDelayProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'delay_seconds' parameter determines the basic duration of the delay introduced before the node processes the input. It is a fundamental aspect of the node's operation as it directly affects the timing of node execution and the moment of output generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'delay_by_text' parameter enhance the functionality of the DynamicDelayProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'delay_by_text' parameter allows for adjustment of the delay based on the length of provided text. This optional feature adds a layer of customization to the node's delay capability, enabling it to accommodate various text-based inputs and their associated delays."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'words_per_seconds' parameter in conjunction with 'delay_by_text' in the DynamicDelayProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'words_per_seconds' parameter, used in conjunction with 'delay_by_text', calculates additional delay based on the length of the text. It plays a key role in fine-tuning the delay behavior of the node to cater to different text lengths and pacing requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'replace_output' parameter affect the output of the DynamicDelayProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'replace_output' parameter determines whether the output of the node after the delay should be replaced with a specified value. This feature provides an additional level of control over the output, allowing the node to either pass through the original input or replace it with a predefined value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'replace_value' parameter in the DynamicDelayProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'replace_value' parameter specifies the value to be used if the 'replace_output' parameter is set to 'enable'. It is crucial for implementing the replacement feature, ensuring the output is accurately modified according to the user's specifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output' parameter in the DynamicDelayProcessor node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'output' parameter represents the result of the node's operation. Depending on the configuration, it can either be a pass-through of the original input or a replacement value as specified by the 'replace_output' and 'replace_value' parameters. It encapsulates the final outcome of the node's delay processing."
