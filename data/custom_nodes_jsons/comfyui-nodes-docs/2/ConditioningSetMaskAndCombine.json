        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node in ComfyUI is designed to apply masks to conditioning data and adjust the conditioning based on the specified masks and their strengths. It combines the functionality of setting masks and merging condition data, allowing dynamic changes to the conditioned areas within a given dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are positive_i, negative_i, mask_i, mask_i_strength, and set_cond_area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the positive_i input represent in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The positive_i input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node specifies a set of conditioning data that is positively influenced by the corresponding mask, playing a key role in customizing the conditions to specific areas or aspects of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mask_i input represent in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The mask_i input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node represents the mask applied to the corresponding conditioning data, determining the areas of influence for the positive or negative conditional adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mask_i_strength input control in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The mask_i_strength input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node defines the strength of the mask's influence on the conditioning, allowing for fine control over how significantly the mask affects the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are combined_positive and combined_negative."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the combined_positive output represent in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The combined_positive output in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node represents the combined result of all positively conditioned data after the mask is applied, reflecting the cumulative effect of the positive adjustments."
