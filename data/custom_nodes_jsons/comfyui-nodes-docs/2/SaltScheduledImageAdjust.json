        "question": "What is the primary function of the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageAdjust node is designed to apply scheduled adjustments to a batch of images, allowing for dynamic changes over time in brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, Gaussian blur, and edge enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node is 'images', which is the collection of images to be adjusted. It is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype List[Image]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input allows for selective application of adjustments to specific areas of an image in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The optional input 'masks' allows for selective application of adjustments to specific areas of an image in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node. It is of Comfy dtype MASK and Python dtype List[Image]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which schedule adjusts the intensity of colors in images over time in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The 'saturation_schedule' adjusts the intensity of colors in images over time in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node. It is of Comfy dtype LIST and Python dtype List[float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node enhance the edges of an image?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageAdjust node enhances the edges of an image by using the 'edge_enhance_schedule', which defines the enhancement of edges within the image over time, allowing for highlighting of details or creation of a more graphical appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node is 'image', which represents the images after the scheduled adjustments have been applied, showing dynamic changes over time. It is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype List[Image]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node is 'CPU'."
