        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Image_scale_to_side node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Image_scale_to_side node in ComfyUI is designed to scale an image to a specified side length while maintaining its aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DF_Image_scale_to_side node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the DF_Image_scale_to_side node are: image, side_length, side, upscale_method, and crop."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'side' parameter in the DF_Image_scale_to_side node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'side' parameter in the DF_Image_scale_to_side node determines which side of the image (width, height, longest side, or shortest side) will be scaled to the specified side length, affecting the direction of the scaling and the final aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'crop' parameter affect the output of the DF_Image_scale_to_side node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop' parameter in the DF_Image_scale_to_side node indicates whether and how the scaled image will be cropped, affecting the final composition and dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Image_scale_to_side node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Image_scale_to_side node is an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which is the scaled image adjusted to the specified side length while maintaining the original aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the DF_Image_scale_to_side node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the DF_Image_scale_to_side node are Reroute, ImpactImageInfo, and VAEEncode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the DF_Image_scale_to_side node use?",
        "answer": "The DF_Image_scale_to_side node uses the GPU infra type."
