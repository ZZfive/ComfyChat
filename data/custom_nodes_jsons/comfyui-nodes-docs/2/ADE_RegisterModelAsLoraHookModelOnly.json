        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node is used to register a model as a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) hook, focusing only on modifying the model. It allows integrating LoRA technology into specific models to enhance their adaptability and performance for executing specific tasks without affecting other components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node are: model (the model to be adapted using LoRA technology), ckpt_name (the checkpoint name from which to apply the LoRA configuration), and strength_model (a float value determining the strength of the LoRA adaptation on the model)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength_model' parameter do in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength_model' parameter is a float value that determines the strength of the LoRA adaptation on the model. It adjusts the influence of the LoRA parameters on the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node are: model (the enhanced model after applying the specified LoRA adaptation) and lora_hook (a reference to the LoRA hook integrated into the model, providing access to the applied LoRA adaptation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which category does the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node falls under the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/register lora hooks' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ckpt_name' input parameter in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' input parameter specifies the checkpoint name from which to apply the LoRA configuration. It determines the LoRA adaptation set to be used, guiding the customization of the model's behavior."
