        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Prompt_Weight node is designed to adjust the influence of a prompt by applying weights, which is crucial for fine-tuning the output of the generation model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prompt' parameter represent in the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter is a text input that guides the output of the generation model. It is essential because it sets the context and subject for the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'weight' parameter affect the prompt in the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter adjusts the influence of the prompt, allowing for subtle control over the model's response. It affects how prominently the prompt is reflected in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node output?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Prompt_Weight node outputs a modified prompt with the applied weight, which can be used as input for subsequent nodes or models, now carrying the adjusted influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'weight' parameter in the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'weight' parameter is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the 'weight' parameter in the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'weight' parameter is 0.1, and the maximum value is 5.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the step size for the 'weight' parameter in the WLSH_Prompt_Weight node?",
        "answer": "The step size for the 'weight' parameter is 0.1."
