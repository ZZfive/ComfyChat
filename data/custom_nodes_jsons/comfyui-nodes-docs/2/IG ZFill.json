        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG ZFill node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG ZFill node provides a simple and effective way to add leading zeros to a given integer value until it reaches a specified length, which is important for formatting numbers to ensure consistent digits, especially suitable for data presentation and string manipulation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IG ZFill node are 'value', which specifies the integer value to be padded with leading zeros, and 'fill', which determines the total length of the output string after padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IG ZFill node is 'string', which is the result string obtained after padding the input value with leading zeros to the specified length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the IG ZFill node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the IG ZFill node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the IG ZFill node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the IG ZFill node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the IG ZFill node in ComfyUI is 'üêì IG Nodes/Primitives'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the IG ZFill node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the IG ZFill node defines the class 'IG_ZFill', its input and output types, and the main function that performs the zero-filling operation on the input value based on the specified fill length."
