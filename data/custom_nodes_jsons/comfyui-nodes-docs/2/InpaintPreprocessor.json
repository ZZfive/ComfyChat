        "question": "What is the purpose of the InpaintPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node is designed to prepare images for inpainting tasks by applying a mask to the input image, marking the areas that need to be inpainted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node requires two inputs: an image parameter representing the input image to be inpainted, and a mask parameter specifying the areas of the image that need to be inpainted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the InpaintPreprocessor node is a modified version of the input image, with the areas specified by the mask marked as needing inpainting, ready for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the InpaintPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which common nodes are often used with the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node is commonly used with the ControlNetApplyAdvanced and ImageScale nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the InpaintPreprocessor node modify the input image?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node modifies the input image by setting the pixels in the areas specified by the mask to -1.0, marking them as masked pixels that need to be inpainted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the InpaintPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/others' category in ComfyUI."
