        "question": "What is the purpose of the AlphaChanelAsMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AlphaChanelAsMask node in ComfyUI is used to process images to extract or invert their alpha channel, effectively converting the alpha channel into a mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AlphaChanelAsMask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the AlphaChanelAsMask node are 'images' (the input image to process) and 'method' (the processing mode for the alpha channel, either standard extraction or inversion)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' parameter in AlphaChanelAsMask node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in the AlphaChanelAsMask node specifies the processing mode for the alpha channel, allowing for either standard alpha channel extraction or its inversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AlphaChanelAsMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AlphaChanelAsMask node is 'mask', which is the mask extracted from the alpha channel of the input image, either representing the direct alpha channel or its inversion based on the selected processing method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the hardware type recommended for the AlphaChanelAsMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended hardware type for the AlphaChanelAsMask node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What error will be raised if the input image does not have an alpha channel?",
        "answer": "If the input image does not have an alpha channel, a ValueError will be raised with the message 'Alpha chanel not exist.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if an unexpected method is provided to the AlphaChanelAsMask node?",
        "answer": "If an unexpected method is provided to the AlphaChanelAsMask node, a ValueError will be raised with the message 'Unexpected method.'"
