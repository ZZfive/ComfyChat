        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToImageList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToImageList node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a set of images into a standardized list format, which is crucial for handling multiple images in a unified way and making it easier to perform operations, analysis, and apply image processing on the entire image collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ToImageList node is 'inputs_len', which represents the image collection to be converted into a list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter represent in the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToImageList node represents the image collection that will be converted into a list format. This input is essential for the node's operation as it determines the image collection that will undergo the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToImageList node is 'image', which is a list of images converted from the input collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ToImageList node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' input in the ToImageList node is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type for the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type for the ToImageList node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code for the ToImageList node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the ToImageList node is: ```python class ToImageList(metaclass=MakeListMeta): TYPE = \"IMAGE\" ```"
