        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateRectMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateRectMask node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a rectangular mask based on specified parameters, allowing for customization of the mask's position and size relative to the applied image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CreateRectMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CreateRectMask node include mode, origin, x, y, width, height, image_width, and image_height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in CreateRectMask determine?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in CreateRectMask determines the unit of measurement for the mask dimensions. It can be 'percent' for percentage-based coordinates or 'pixels' for absolute pixel values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'origin' parameter affect the mask's position in CreateRectMask?",
        "answer": "The 'origin' parameter in CreateRectMask determines the reference point for calculating the mask's position. It can be one of 'topleft', 'bottomleft', 'topleft', or 'bottomright'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the optional 'copy_image_size' parameter in CreateRectMask?",
        "answer": "The optional 'copy_image_size' parameter in CreateRectMask allows the mask to adopt the dimensions of the provided image, enabling the creation of masks with dynamic sizes based on the applied image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CreateRectMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CreateRectMask node is a binary image representing the rectangular region defined by the input parameters, which is a key component for various image processing tasks such as object segmentation or masking."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CreateRectMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CreateRectMask node is CPU."
