        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageToMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node is designed to extract specific color channels from an input image to create a mask, which can be used for various image processing tasks, playing a key role in segmenting and isolating specific features within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageToMask node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'channel' (Comfy dtype: COMBO['red', 'green', 'blue', 'alpha'], Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'channel' parameter specify in the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'channel' parameter specifies which color channel is to be extracted from the image. It is a crucial input as it determines the specific aspects of the image that will be represented in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageToMask node is 'mask' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which is a single-channel representation of the selected color channel from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageToMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageToMask node is 'mask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function is used by the ImageToMask node to perform its operation?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node uses the 'image_to_mask' function to perform its operation."
