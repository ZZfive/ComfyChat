        "question": "What is the purpose of the Compare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Compare node in ComfyUI is designed to evaluate the relationship between two inputs based on a specified comparison operation, such as equality, inequality, greater than, or less than. It abstracts the comparison logic into a simple interface, allowing users to dynamically evaluate and process the conditions of their data or variables."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The Compare node requires three inputs: 'a' (the first input to be compared), 'b' (the second input to be compared), and 'comparison' (the type of comparison to be performed, such as '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', or '>=')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Compare node is BOOLEAN, which represents the result of the comparison operation, indicating whether the specified condition between the two inputs is true or false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Compare node is CPU."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Compare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Compare node belongs to the Logic category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return name of the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The return name of the Compare node is BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used by the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The Compare node uses the function named 'compare' to perform the comparison operation."
