        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMTreeIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMTreeIndex node is designed to build an index structure from a set of language model nodes to enable efficient querying and retrieval of information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMTreeIndex node are 'llm_model' and 'llm_nodes'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'llm_model' input specify in the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'llm_model' input specifies the language model to be used for indexing, serving as the foundation for building the tree index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'llm_nodes' input define in the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'llm_nodes' input defines the set of nodes to be indexed, representing the data structure that the tree index will organize and make searchable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'service_context' input in the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'service_context' input is used to customize the indexing process based on specific service requirements, enhancing the relevance of the index."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'num_children' input affect the tree structure in the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_children' input determines the maximum number of child nodes each node in the tree can have, influencing the width of the tree."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMTreeIndex node is 'llm_index', representing the generated index structure optimized for efficient querying and retrieval within the specified language model context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the LLMTreeIndex node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the LLMTreeIndex node is 'CPU'."
