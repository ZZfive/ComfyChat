        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWLoadImageSequence node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequence node is used to batch load image sequences with a specified stop index in ComfyUI. It allows users to define specific ranges within the sequence for efficient processing and handling of multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the JWLoadImageSequence node are path_pattern, start_index, frame_count, and ignore_missing_images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the path_pattern parameter specify in the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The path_pattern parameter specifies the pattern or path used to locate and load the image sequence. It plays a key role in identifying the files to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the start_index parameter affect the image sequence loading in JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The start_index parameter defines the starting index for loading the image sequence, determining the initial image to be included in the processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frame_count parameter control in the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The frame_count parameter indicates the number of frames to be loaded starting from the start_index, controlling the length of the image sequence to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ignore_missing_images parameter in the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The ignore_missing_images parameter determines whether to ignore missing images within the specified range, allowing for flexible handling of incomplete sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWLoadImageSequence node is an IMAGE, which represents a batch of images loaded based on the specified conditions, suitable for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the JWLoadImageSequence node is CPU."
