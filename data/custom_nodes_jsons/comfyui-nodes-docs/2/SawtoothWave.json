        "question": "What is the purpose of the SawtoothWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SawtoothWave node is used to generate a waveform pattern based on the specified phase, step increment, and displacement. This helps with signal processing or waveform generation tasks within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input parameters of the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The input parameters of the SawtoothWave node are phase, step_increment, x_translation, start_value, and current_frame. Each of these parameters has a specified Comfy dtype and Python dtype, and they control different aspects of the waveform generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SawtoothWave node calculate the output?",
        "answer": "The SawtoothWave node calculates the output by adding the start_value to the product of the step_increment and the current_frame modulo phase, minus the x_translation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The SawtoothWave node provides two output types: output, which is the calculated value of the waveform at the current frame, and int_output, which is an integer representation of the output, suitable for discrete operations or numeric analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the SawtoothWave node typically used?",
        "answer": "The SawtoothWave node is typically used for signal processing tasks in systems where waveform generation is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What default values do the input parameters of the SawtoothWave node have?",
        "answer": "The input parameters of the SawtoothWave node have default values as follows: phase=1.0, step_increment=0.5, x_translation=0.0, start_value=0.5, and current_frame=1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the respective dtypes for each input parameter of the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The respective dtypes for each input parameter of the SawtoothWave node are as follows: phase=FLOAT, step_increment=FLOAT, x_translation=FLOAT, start_value=FLOAT, and current_frame=INT."
