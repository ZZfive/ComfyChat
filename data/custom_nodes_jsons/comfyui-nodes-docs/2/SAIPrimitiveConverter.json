        "question": "What is the purpose of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAIPrimitiveConverter node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the conversion between different primitive data types, handling multiple formats such as strings, lists, and dictionaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The SAIPrimitiveConverter node requires two inputs: 'input_value', which is the original input value to be converted, and 'output_type', which specifies the desired output data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does the SAIPrimitiveConverter node accept?",
        "answer": "The SAIPrimitiveConverter node accepts two optional inputs: 'sub_data_type', which defines the sub-type for conversion, and 'index_or_key', which allows indexing into lists or accessing values in dictionaries by key."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'process_input_value' function in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node do?",
        "answer": "The 'process_input_value' function processes the input value based on its type and structure, applying necessary conversions according to the specified sub-data type, and handling complex data structures like lists and dictionaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SAIPrimitiveConverter node handle unsupported output types?",
        "answer": "If an unsupported output type is specified, the SAIPrimitiveConverter node defaults to converting the processed input into a list, while also printing an error message indicating the issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the conversion process in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node fails?",
        "answer": "If the conversion process fails due to a ValueError or TypeError, the SAIPrimitiveConverter node defaults to a base value for the specified output type and prints an error message."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node is the converted data, presented in the specified output type, reflecting the result of the conversion applied to the input value."
