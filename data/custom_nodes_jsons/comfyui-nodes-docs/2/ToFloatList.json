        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToFloatList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToFloatList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate individual floating-point values into a list, facilitating scenarios where multiple floating-point entries need to be collectively processed or manipulated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ToFloatList node is 'inputs_len', which specifies the number of floating-point inputs to be aggregated into the list. This parameter determines the size of the resulting float list, allowing for dynamic list creation based on the number of inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToFloatList node is 'float', which generates a list composed of the aggregated floating-point inputs. This list serves as a structured collection of floating-point values that can be further processed or operated upon in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output 'float' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the output 'float' is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output 'float' in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the output 'float' is List[float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ToFloatList node is CPU."
