        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS custom node provides a Canny edge detection preprocessor for SEGS (Semantic Edge Guided Synthesis) to enhance image edges and achieve better segmentation and synthesis results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of Canny edge detection in image processing?",
        "answer": "Canny edge detection is a popular edge detection algorithm that effectively identifies edge features in images, which is important for subsequent image segmentation and processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'low_threshold' parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node control?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' parameter specifies the lower limit of the hysteresis thresholding step in the Canny edge detection algorithm, affecting the detection of weaker edges. A lower threshold value leads to the detection of more edges, including some faint edges that may be noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'high_threshold' parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'high_threshold' parameter defines the upper limit of the hysteresis thresholding step, determining the detection of the most significant edges. A higher threshold value results in detecting only the strongest edges, potentially ignoring some important but less prominent edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessor object configured for Canny edge detection, which can be directly used in the SEGS workflow. This preprocessor applies the specified low and high threshold parameters to perform Canny edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is located in the 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' category within ComfyUI."
