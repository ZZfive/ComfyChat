        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node generates a sinusoidal curve with customizable wavelength, phase, and amplitude, making it easy to create periodic waveforms for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the wavelength parameter control in the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The wavelength parameter determines the period of the sinusoidal curve, affecting its overall length and the spacing between its peaks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the phase parameter affect the sinusoidal curve in the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter moves the sinusoidal curve along the timeline, changing the timing of its peaks and troughs relative to the starting point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the amplitude parameter in the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter controls the size of the peaks and troughs of the sinusoidal curve, affecting the extent of its oscillation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node outputs a keyframed curve object representing the sinusoidal waveform and a sinusoidal curve derived from the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the wavelength parameter in the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the wavelength parameter in the KfSinusoidalWithWavelength node is 12."
