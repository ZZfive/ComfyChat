        "question": "What is the purpose of the SDXLResolution node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SDXLResolution node is to parse a resolution string and convert it into corresponding integer values for width and height, ensuring graphical outputs adhere to specified dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected format for the 'resolution' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The expected format for the 'resolution' input parameter is a string in the format of 'widthxheight', which the node then breaks down into individual width and height values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SDXLResolution node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SDXLResolution node are 'width' and 'height', both of which are integers representing the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the graphical resolution, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' output parameter affect visual content in an application or display?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output parameter directly impacts the scaling and layout of visual content in an application or display as it represents the horizontal dimension of the graphical resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'height' output parameter play in determining visual content's vertical range?",
        "answer": "The 'height' output parameter is crucial in determining the vertical range of visual content and ensuring appropriate display formatting as it represents the vertical dimension of the graphical resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SDXLResolution node use?",
        "answer": "The SDXLResolution node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SDXLResolution node's 'op' function process the 'resolution' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The SDXLResolution node's 'op' function processes the 'resolution' input parameter by splitting the string at 'x' to separate the width and height values and then converting them to integers before returning them as a tuple."
