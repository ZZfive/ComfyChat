    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the ckpt_name parameter in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The ckpt_name parameter is crucial for specifying the pre-trained model to be used for image generation. It guides the node in locating and loading the appropriate model weights and configuration, which is essential for the subsequent generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the positive parameter influence the image generation process in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The positive parameter serves as a text prompt, guiding the image generation process. Its importance lies in setting the thematic direction for the output, influencing the overall style and content of the synthesized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the negative parameter play in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The negative parameter acts as an exclusionary filter for image generation, steering the output away from certain elements or themes. It refines the creative direction by specifying aspects to be avoided in the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the width and height parameters affect the image generation in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The width and height parameters determine the horizontal and vertical resolution of the generated image, respectively. They play a key role in defining the canvas size for the output, influencing the overall detail and quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the inference_steps parameter in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The inference_steps parameter controls the number of iterations used in the diffusion process, directly impacting the complexity and intricacy of the generated image. It is a crucial factor in achieving the desired level of detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cfg parameter influence the image generation process in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The cfg parameter adjusts the model's configuration settings, fine-tuning the generation process to achieve specific visual effects. It affects the output's style consistency and adherence to the desired aesthetic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the seed parameter play in the DemofusionFromSingleFile node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter ensures reproducibility of results by initializing the random number generator with a fixed value. It is crucial for consistent experimentation and result comparison across different runs."
