        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskFromSegmentation+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromSegmentation+ node is designed to generate masks based on image segmentation. It identifies and isolates specific features or objects in an image through segmentation techniques, facilitating feature extraction and object recognition in image processing and computer vision tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MaskFromSegmentation+ node are: an input image that serves as the basis for segmentation and mask generation, segments that specify the parts of the image to be used for creating the mask, a boolean flag 'remove_isolated_pixels' to remove isolated pixels from the generated mask, a boolean flag 'remove_small_masks' to remove small masks from the generated mask, and a boolean flag 'fill_holes' to fill holes in the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segments' input specify in the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'segments' input in the MaskFromSegmentation+ node specifies the parts of the image that are used to create the mask, allowing targeted extraction within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'remove_isolated_pixels' input in the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'remove_isolated_pixels' input is a boolean flag that, when set, removes isolated pixels from the generated mask, improving the mask quality by eliminating noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'remove_small_masks' input affect the output of the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'remove_small_masks' input is a boolean flag that, when set, removes small masks from the generated mask, focusing on important segmentations by filtering out minor parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'fill_holes' input in the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'fill_holes' input is a boolean flag that, when set, fills holes in the generated mask, ensuring a more continuous and coherent output mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskFromSegmentation+ node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskFromSegmentation+ node is a mask generated from the specified image segmentation, which is used to isolate the desired features or objects."
