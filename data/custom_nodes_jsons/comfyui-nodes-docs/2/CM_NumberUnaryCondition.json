        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberUnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberUnaryCondition node is designed to evaluate the relationship between a single operand and a set of unary conditions to determine the validity of the conditions in a mathematical context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the NumberUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the NumberUnaryCondition node are 'op' (defining the unary condition to be applied to the operand 'a') and 'a' (representing the operand to which the unary condition will be applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the NumberUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the NumberUnaryCondition node is 'result', which represents the result of the unary condition check. It is a boolean value indicating whether the operand 'a' satisfies the condition defined by 'op'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the NumberUnaryCondition node use?",
        "answer": "The NumberUnaryCondition node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the NumberUnaryCondition node classified?",
        "answer": "The NumberUnaryCondition node is classified under the 'math/number' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'op' parameter in the NumberUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the NumberUnaryCondition node defines the unary condition to be applied to the operand 'a'. It is crucial as it determines the type of mathematical condition check to be performed, directly affecting the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'a' parameter in the NumberUnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the NumberUnaryCondition node represents the operand to which the unary condition will be applied. Its value is essential as it is the subject of the condition check, determining the result of the node's evaluation."
