        "question": "What is the purpose of the SetLatentNoiseMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SetLatentNoiseMask node is designed to apply a noise mask to a set of latent samples, playing a crucial role in the inpainting process by allowing selective manipulation of the latent space representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SetLatentNoiseMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SetLatentNoiseMask node are 'samples' and 'mask'. 'samples' is a collection of latent representations that will be modified through the noise mask, and 'mask' defines the areas of the latent samples that need to be masked."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'samples' parameter in the SetLatentNoiseMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it determines the data that will undergo the masking process, directly influencing the execution of the node and the final visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the SetLatentNoiseMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is essential for the node as it defines the portions of the latent space that will be altered. The shape of the mask must be compatible with the latent samples for the node to function correctly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SetLatentNoiseMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SetLatentNoiseMask node is 'modified_samples', which consists of latent samples that have had the noise mask applied. This output is important as it represents the primary result of the node, to be used in subsequent stages of the inpainting workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the SetLatentNoiseMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the SetLatentNoiseMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'set_mask' function in the SetLatentNoiseMask node do?",
        "answer": "The 'set_mask' function in the SetLatentNoiseMask node applies the noise mask to the latent samples, modifying them according to the provided mask. This function is central to the node's operation, enabling selective alterations in the latent space."
