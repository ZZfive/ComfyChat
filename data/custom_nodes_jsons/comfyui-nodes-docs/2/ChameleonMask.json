        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChameleonMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChameleonMask node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically adjust or modify image masks based on specific criteria or inputs, enabling flexible and context-sensitive mask processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ChameleonMask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ChameleonMask node include dst (target image), src (source image), thresh_blur (threshold blur value), close_dist (closing operation distance), open_dist (opening operation distance), size_dist (size distribution adjustment), mask_blur (mask blur amount), contrast_adjust (contrast adjustment), mode (operation mode), and output_format (output image format)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the ChameleonMask node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the ChameleonMask node specifies the operation mode for mask generation, providing different strategies for creating masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'optional_roi_mask' input in the ChameleonMask node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'optional_roi_mask' input in the ChameleonMask node allows for further optimization of the mask generation process by specifying a region of interest mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ChameleonMask node?",
        "answer": "The ChameleonMask node outputs an image with the mask applied, demonstrating the result of the mask operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChameleonMask node handle different color modes when computing the difference between images?",
        "answer": "The ChameleonMask node uses predefined functions in the mode_func_map dictionary to convert the source and destination images to the specified color mode before computing the difference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'size_dist' parameter in the ChameleonMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'size_dist' parameter in the ChameleonMask node controls the size distribution adjustment of the mask, affecting the overall mask structure. A positive value applies dilation, while a negative value applies erosion."
