        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec3UnaryOperation class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec3UnaryOperation class in ComfyUI is designed to perform unary operations on three-dimensional vectors. It encapsulates the logic of various vector operations and provides a flexible interface for mathematical operations in three-dimensional space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter specify in the Vec3UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec3UnaryOperation class specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector. It is crucial because it determines the type of mathematical function that will be applied to each component of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the Vec3UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec3UnaryOperation class represents the three-dimensional vector on which the unary operation will be performed. It is a necessary input because it is the object of the mathematical operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'result' output in the Vec3UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the Vec3UnaryOperation class is the transformed three-dimensional vector after applying the specified unary operation. It is important because it represents the result of the mathematical process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec3UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec3UnaryOperation class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Vec3UnaryOperation class?",
        "answer": "The category of the Vec3UnaryOperation class is 'math/vec3'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the Vec3UnaryOperation class define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Vec3UnaryOperation class defines the input types, return types, function, category, and the operation method 'op' that performs the unary operation on the input vector 'a' and returns the resulting vector."
