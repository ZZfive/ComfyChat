        "question": "What is the purpose of the Unsampler class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unsampler class in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the process of generating high-fidelity samples from a given model by iteratively refining the latent space. It aims to improve the quality of generated images through a controlled sampling process and allows for the use of conditional inputs to guide the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Unsampler class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Unsampler class include: model, steps, cfg, sampler_name, positive, negative, and latent_image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter affect the Unsampler operation?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter is crucial for the sampling process as it determines the number of iterations the Unsampler will perform to refine the latent space and generate the final sample."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'positive' and 'negative' parameters in the Unsampler?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' parameter serves as the positive conditional input for the Unsampler, guiding the generation process towards desired features or characteristics in the output sample. The 'negative' parameter, on the other hand, helps the Unsampler avoid undesired features or characteristics in the generated sample."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' parameter represent in the Unsampler?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter is essential as it provides the initial point in the latent space from which the Unsampler begins its refinement process, significantly influencing the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Unsampler class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Unsampler class is 'samples', which represents the final refined points in the latent space, resulting from the Unsampler's iterative process. These points are crucial for generating high-quality images that meet the desired conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the Unsampler class?",
        "answer": "The Unsampler class is recommended to be run on a GPU infrastructure for optimal performance."
