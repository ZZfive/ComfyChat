        "question": "What is the purpose of the TEEDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images using the TEED (TEDDetector) model to extract soft edge lines, enhancing the input image for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the TEEDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the TEEDPreprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to undergo soft edge line extraction processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the TEEDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the TEEDPreprocessor node are 'safe_steps', which defines the number of safety steps to be taken during the line extraction process, and 'resolution', which specifies the resolution at which the image should be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the TEEDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the TEEDPreprocessor node is an image, which is an image that has undergone line extraction processing, highlighting soft edges and making it more suitable for tasks requiring detailed line information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the TEEDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the TEEDPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the TEEDPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TEEDPreprocessor node execute the line extraction process?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor node executes the line extraction process by using the TEDDetector model, which is loaded from a pre-trained state, and applying it to the input image with specified resolution and safety steps."
