        "question": "What is the purpose of the SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load and process SMPL model data from a specified file, facilitating the integration of SMPL models into motion analysis and synthesis workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SMPLLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SMPLLoader node are 'smpl' and 'smpl_model'. 'smpl' specifies the SMPL model filename to load, while 'smpl_model' determines the specific SMPL model to use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'smpl' output type of the SMPLLoader node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'smpl' output type of the SMPLLoader node contains a tuple with the SMPL model's path, pose parameters (thetas), and metadata, which can be used for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SMPLLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SMPLLoader node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'load_smpl' method in the SMPLLoader class?",
        "answer": "The 'load_smpl' method in the SMPLLoader class loads the specified SMPL model file, extracts the pose parameters (thetas) and metadata, and returns a tuple containing the SMPL model path, thetas, and metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SMPLLoader node determine the available SMPL models?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node determines the available SMPL models by accessing a global dictionary called 'smpl_model_dicts', which is obtained using the 'get_smpl_models_dict()' function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI is 'MotionDiff/smpl'."
