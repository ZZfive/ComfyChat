        "question": "What is the purpose of the TextCombinations3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations3 node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a set of text manipulations that combine input texts in various ways. It provides a method to mix and transform text strings based on predefined operations and specified delimiters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the TextCombinations3 node are 'text1', 'text2', 'text3', and 'operation'. These parameters represent the input text strings and the specific text combination operation to be performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'delimiter' parameter specify in the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'delimiter' parameter in the TextCombinations3 node specifies the character or string used to separate the components of the combined text. It is important for defining the format of the final output and ensuring that the mixed text is presented coherently."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_seed' parameter affect the text combination process in the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_seed' parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether a seed value should be used to select an operation from a predefined list. It affects the randomness and reproducibility of the text combination process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the TextCombinations3 node are 'output1', 'output2', and 'output3'. These parameters represent the mixed text outputs generated by the node, showcasing the combination and transformation of the input texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TextCombinations3 node handle the 'seed' parameter when 'use_seed' is set to true?",
        "answer": "When 'use_seed' is set to true, the TextCombinations3 node uses the 'seed' parameter as the random seed for operation selection. It ensures a consistent starting point for generating text combinations, which is crucial for obtaining reproducible results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the TextCombinations3 node is CPU."
