        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various integer binary operations. It takes two integers and a string representing the operation to be performed, and returns the result of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'op' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node is a string that specifies the binary operation to be performed on the two integers. It is crucial as it determines the type of arithmetic operation to be executed, directly influencing the result of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'a' parameter play in the IntBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node represents the first operand in the binary operation. As an integral part of the operation, it plays a significant role in the mathematical computation. The value of 'a' directly affects the final result of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How important is the 'b' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node is equally important as 'a'. It represents the second operand in the binary operation and is essential for completing the computation and obtaining the correct result. The value of 'b' significantly impacts the outcome of the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' parameter in the IntBinaryOperation node is the outcome of the binary operation performed by the node. It contains the final value computed based on the input operands and the specified operation, serving as the primary output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the IntBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the IntBinaryOperation node is CPU, indicating that the node is executed using the processing power of the central processing unit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used to implement the IntBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The IntBinaryOperation node is implemented using Python, as evidenced by the source code provided in the documentation."
