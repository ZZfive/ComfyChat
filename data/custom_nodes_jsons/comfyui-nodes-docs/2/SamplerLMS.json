        "question": "What is the purpose of the SamplerLMS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLMS node in ComfyUI is designed to generate custom samplers for specific sampling strategies. It encapsulates the functionality of creating and configuring samplers using the 'ksampler' function, which is optimized for different sampling methods such as 'dpm_fast' or 'dpm_adaptive'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'order' parameter in the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The 'order' parameter is crucial for determining the order of the sampling method used by the SamplerLMS node. It directly affects the configuration of the sampler, which in turn influences the quality and characteristics of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SamplerLMS node is a configured sampler object represented by 'sampler'. It is important as it is used in subsequent steps of the sampling process and directly impacts the outcome of the sampling task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the SamplerLMS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The category of the SamplerLMS node is 'sampling/custom_sampling/samplers'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the SamplerLMS node to create samplers?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLMS node uses the 'ksampler' function to create samplers, which is optimized for different sampling methods like 'dpm_fast' or 'dpm_adaptive'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input and output data types of the 'order' parameter and 'sampler' output in the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The 'order' parameter has an input data type of INT in Comfy and int in Python. The 'sampler' output has an output data type of SAMPLER in Comfy and KSAMPLER in Python."
