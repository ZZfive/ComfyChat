        "question": "What is the purpose of PPFNCrossHatchNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PPFNCrossHatchNode is designed to generate complex cross-hatch patterns with power fractal effects, providing an advanced method for creating visually complex and detailed images in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'batch_size' parameter affect the output of PPFNCrossHatchNode?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter determines the number of images generated per operation, directly impacting the scale and throughput of the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'frequency' parameter play in generating cross-hatch patterns?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' parameter controls the density of cross-hatch lines; a higher value results in more complex patterns and greater visual complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'octaves' parameter influence the output of PPFNCrossHatchNode?",
        "answer": "The 'octaves' parameter affects the level of detail and complexity in the fractal generation process; higher octaves produce more detailed and diverse patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'color_tolerance' parameter in PPFNCrossHatchNode?",
        "answer": "The 'color_tolerance' parameter refines the mapping of noise values to colors, ensuring that cross-hatch patterns have a more subtle and varied color palette."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'angle_degrees' parameter contribute to the overall aesthetics of the generated patterns?",
        "answer": "The 'angle_degrees' parameter sets the direction of the cross-hatch lines, which is fundamental in defining the overall aesthetics and directionality of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of PPFNCrossHatchNode?",
        "answer": "PPFNCrossHatchNode outputs two types of data: 'latents', which provide a compressed representation of the generated images, and 'previews', which offer a scaled-down version of the images for quick visual inspection."
