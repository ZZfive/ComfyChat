        "question": "What is the purpose of the SolidMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SolidMask node is designed to generate a solid mask with a uniform value across all its dimensions. It is particularly useful for creating basic masks for further processing or as starting points for more complex mask operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' parameter in the SolidMask node define?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter defines the uniform value that will be used to fill the entire mask. It is crucial because it determines the base color or intensity of the mask, which can significantly impact subsequent operations or analyses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter specify in the SolidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter specifies the width of the mask in pixels. It is an important parameter as it determines the horizontal resolution of the mask, which can influence how the mask is processed or displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'height' parameter set in the SolidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' parameter sets the vertical height of the mask in pixels. It plays a key role in establishing the vertical resolution of the mask, which is essential for the mask's use in different application scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SolidMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SolidMask node is a tensor representing the solid mask generated by the node. It contains the uniform value specified by the 'value' parameter across all its dimensions, serving as a fundamental component for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SolidMask node use?",
        "answer": "The SolidMask node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'value' parameter in the SolidMask node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'value' parameter in the SolidMask node is 1.0."
