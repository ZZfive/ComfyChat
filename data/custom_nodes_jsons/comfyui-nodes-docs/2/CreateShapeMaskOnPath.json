        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI is used to generate shape-based masks along a specified path, creating dynamic and animated masking effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node are: shape, coordinates, grow, frame_width, frame_height, shape_width, and shape_height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'shape' parameter in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'shape' parameter in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node specifies the geometric shape of the mask to be created, such as circle, square, or triangle."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'coordinates' parameter affect the mask creation in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The 'coordinates' parameter in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node defines the center locations of the mask along the path, allowing precise control over the mask's placement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'grow' parameter in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The 'grow' parameter in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node determines the amount by which the shape grows in each frame, enabling the creation of animated masks that change size over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node are: mask and mask_inverted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node generate the final mask output?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node generates the final mask output by creating an image with the specified shape, size, and coordinates for each frame, and then converting the image to a tensor mask."
