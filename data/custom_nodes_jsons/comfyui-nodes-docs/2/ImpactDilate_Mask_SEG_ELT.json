        "question": "What is the purpose of the Dilate_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Dilate_SEG_ELT node is designed to perform morphological dilation on segmentation masks, which is a crucial step in image processing to expand the boundaries of detected objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the seg_elt parameter in the Dilate_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The seg_elt parameter is a critical input that contains the segmentation element to be processed. It includes the cropped image, mask, confidence score, crop region, bounding box, label, and control net wrapper, all of which are essential for correctly executing the dilation operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the dilation parameter in the Dilate_SEG_ELT node control?",
        "answer": "The dilation parameter determines the extent of the dilation effect applied to the mask. Larger values lead to more significant expansions of the mask boundaries, which can be crucial for certain image analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the dilation parameter in the Dilate_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the dilation parameter is set to ensure a balanced dilation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Dilate_SEG_ELT node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Dilate_SEG_ELT node is the processed segmentation element with an updated mask reflecting the dilation operation. This output is crucial as it forms the basis for further analysis or visualization in the image processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Dilate_SEG_ELT node run on?",
        "answer": "The Dilate_SEG_ELT node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Dilate_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Dilate_SEG_ELT node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
