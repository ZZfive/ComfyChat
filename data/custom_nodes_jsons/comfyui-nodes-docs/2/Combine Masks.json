        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskCombineOp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskCombineOp node is designed to perform various operations on two input images, such as union, intersection, and multiplication, to combine them into a single image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MaskCombineOp node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MaskCombineOp node are: image1 (the first image to be combined), image2 (the second image to be combined), op (the operation to be performed on the two images), clamp_result (whether to clamp the result after the operation), and round_result (whether to round the result to the nearest integer)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'op' parameter in the MaskCombineOp node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the MaskCombineOp node defines how the two input images should be combined. It is a key parameter that determines the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clamp_result' parameter do in the MaskCombineOp node?",
        "answer": "The 'clamp_result' parameter in the MaskCombineOp node determines whether the result should be clamped within a certain range after the operation is performed. Clamping can prevent extreme values that may be produced by certain operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'round_result' parameter in the MaskCombineOp node?",
        "answer": "The 'round_result' parameter in the MaskCombineOp node specifies whether the result should be rounded to the nearest integer after the operation is performed. Rounding is useful for certain types of image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskCombineOp node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskCombineOp node is the 'result', which is the combined image produced by the operation performed by the node. It represents the visual result of the combination process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MaskCombineOp node use?",
        "answer": "The MaskCombineOp node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
