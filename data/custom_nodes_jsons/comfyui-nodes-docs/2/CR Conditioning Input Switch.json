        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node is designed to manage data flow based on conditional input. It allows selecting one of two conditional inputs based on the value of the 'Input' parameter, playing a crucial role in complex workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Input' parameter in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter is essential for determining which conditional data will be selected. It acts as a switch, selecting 'conditioning1' when the value is 1, and 'conditioning2' for any other value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the 'Input' parameter in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node equals 1?",
        "answer": "When the 'Input' parameter equals 1, the node selects the 'conditioning1' input, using it as the source of conditional data for the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning1' parameter in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning1' parameter is one of the optional inputs that will be used when the 'Input' parameter equals 1. It represents a set of conditional data that can be integrated into the workflow when specific conditions are met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning2' parameter in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning2' parameter is an alternative to 'conditioning1' and will be invoked when the 'Input' parameter does not equal 1. It allows for different conditional data to be provided based on different conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'CONDITIONING' output represent in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'CONDITIONING' output represents the conditional data selected based on the value of the 'Input' parameter. It is the result of the node's conditional logic and provides necessary information for subsequent steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output in the CR_ConditioningInputSwitch node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, allowing users to quickly access additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node."
