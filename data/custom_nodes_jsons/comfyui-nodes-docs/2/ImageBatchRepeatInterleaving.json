        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node in ComfyUI is designed to expand an image batch by repeating each image in the batch a specified number of times, effectively increasing the batch size through image duplication."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node are 'images', which represents the batch of images to be repeated, and 'repeats', which specifies the number of times each image in the batch should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'repeats' parameter affect the final batch size in the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeats' parameter directly affects the final batch size by determining the factor by which each image is duplicated, thus increasing the overall number of images in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node is a new image batch (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) where each original image has been repeated according to the 'repeats' parameter, effectively enlarging the batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node modify a batch of 5 images with a 'repeats' value of 2?",
        "answer": "With a 'repeats' value of 2, the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node modifies a batch of 5 images (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) into a batch of 10 images (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4) by repeating each image twice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute in the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving class specify?",
        "answer": "The 'FUNCTION' attribute in the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving class specifies the function name as 'repeat', indicating the operation performed by the node."
