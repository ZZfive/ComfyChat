        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactInt node in the ImpactPack/Logic category?",
        "answer": "The ImpactInt node's 'doit' method is designed to execute a basic logic operation. It receives an integer input and returns the same integer value, serving as a basic pass-through function in the ImpactPack suite. This node is crucial in scenarios where the integrity of the input data must be maintained, ensuring that the information flow remains unchanged during the computation process."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'value' parameter in the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter is an integral part of the ImpactInt node's operation. It is the only input required for the node to execute its pass-through function. The node's ability to maintain input integrity depends on the correct provision of this parameter, highlighting its importance in the overall functionality of the node."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'result' output parameter in the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output parameter of the ImpactInt node directly reflects the input 'value'. It signifies the successful execution of the node and the maintenance of input data integrity. This output is important as it provides a reliable and unmodified version of the input integer, ensuring the continuity and accuracy of subsequent operations in the computational workflow."

        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImpactInt node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'value' input parameter in the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'value' input parameter in the ImpactInt node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'result' output parameter in the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'result' output parameter in the ImpactInt node is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'value' input parameter in the ImpactInt node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'value' input parameter in the ImpactInt node is 0."
