        "question": "What is the purpose of WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise node is designed to generate Perlin noise patterns that can be used for creating natural textures in various graphical applications. It generates images with procedural noise based on specified parameters like width, height, scale, octaves, persistence, and an optional random seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter determines the horizontal resolution of the generated noise image. It is a key factor in defining the output size and affects how the noise pattern is displayed and used in graphical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scale' parameter affect the Perlin noise generated by WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter adjusts the size of the Perlin noise cells. It changes the density of the noise pattern, with higher values leading to more complex and smaller noise cells, while lower values produce sparser and larger cells."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'octaves' parameter in WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise?",
        "answer": "The 'octaves' parameter controls the number of frequency levels used to construct the noise pattern. More octaves add complexity and detail to the noise, creating more natural and varied textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'persistence' parameter affect the noise generated by WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise?",
        "answer": "The 'persistence' parameter defines the rate at which the amplitude decreases between successive octaves. It influences the contrast between different noise layers, helping to form the overall texture characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'seed' parameter do in WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is an optional integer used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring reproducible noise patterns. It allows for consistent results when the same seed value is used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise node?",
        "answer": "The output of WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise node is an 'image'. It provides the generated Perlin noise as an image that can be further manipulated or directly used for texturing purposes in graphical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise run on?",
        "answer": "WAS_Image_Perlin_Noise runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
