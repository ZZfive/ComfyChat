        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate image-to-image conversion and inpainting tasks. It accepts parameters that define denoising levels and inpainting mask characteristics and outputs a structured data stream suitable for further processing in image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'denoise' parameter control in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node controls the level of denoising applied to the image. It is crucial for enhancing image quality by reducing unwanted noise while preserving important details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'inpaint_mask_blur' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_mask_blur' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node determines the blur radius of the inpainting mask, which is important for the smoothness of the inpainted areas in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inpaint_mask_mode' parameter select in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_mask_mode' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node selects the operation mode of the inpainting mask, affecting how the inpainting process is applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'data' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node is an optional input that allows users to provide an existing data stream for processing, enhancing the flexibility of the node's application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node is a structured data stream that encapsulates the results of the image-to-image conversion and inpainting process, ready for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node is CPU."
