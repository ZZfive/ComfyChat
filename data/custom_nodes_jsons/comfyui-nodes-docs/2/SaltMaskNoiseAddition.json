        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskNoiseAddition node is designed to introduce noise into mask regions, simulating variations and imperfections that may occur in real scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node is 'masks', which represents the mask regions where noise will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mean' parameter control in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The 'mean' parameter specifies the mean value of the noise distribution, allowing control over the overall brightness or darkness of the added noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'stddev' parameter affect the noise added to the mask in SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The 'stddev' parameter determines the standard deviation of the noise distribution, influencing the degree of variation and intensity of the noise added to the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node is 'MASKS', which contains the modified mask regions with added noise based on the specified mean and standard deviation parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node commonly run?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskNoiseAddition node commonly runs on the 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the noise_addition function in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition class do?",
        "answer": "The noise_addition function in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition class takes the mask regions, mean, and standard deviation as input, generates noise based on the specified parameters, adds the noise to the mask regions, and returns the modified mask regions as a tensor."
