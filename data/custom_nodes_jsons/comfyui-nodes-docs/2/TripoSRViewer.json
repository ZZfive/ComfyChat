        "question": "What is the purpose of the TripoSRViewer class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TripoSRViewer class in ComfyUI is designed to visualize and export 3D meshes. It processes the input mesh through a series of transformations to prepare it for visualization and saves the modified mesh in a specified directory structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the mesh parameter in the display method of TripoSRViewer?",
        "answer": "The mesh parameter is crucial for the display method as it represents the 3D model that needs to be visualized and exported. It directly influences the result of the node execution by determining the object to be processed and displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the TripoSRViewer's display method?",
        "answer": "The output of the display method is the modified and saved 3D model, which provides users with tangible results of the visualization process, allowing for further analysis or usage in downstream applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the TripoSRViewer node use?",
        "answer": "The TripoSRViewer node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TripoSRViewer class save the processed meshes?",
        "answer": "The TripoSRViewer class saves the processed meshes by applying a transformation to each single mesh, exporting it to a specified file path, and appending the file information to a list of saved meshes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the display method in the TripoSRViewer class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the display method in the TripoSRViewer class is a dictionary containing the 'ui' key with a value of another dictionary. This dictionary maps the 'mesh' key to a list of saved mesh information, including the filename, type, and subfolder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the TripoSRViewer node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TripoSRViewer node belongs to the 'Flowty TripoSR' category in ComfyUI."
