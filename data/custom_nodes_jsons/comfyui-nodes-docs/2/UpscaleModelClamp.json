        "question": "What is the purpose of the UpscaleModelClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UpscaleModelClamp node is designed to pass the upsample model without making any modifications. It serves as a placeholder or checkpoint in processing flows involving model operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the UpscaleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the UpscaleModelClamp node is 'upscale_model', which is the upsample model to be passed through the node. It serves as a direct input for potential further processing or utilization in the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the required input 'upscale_model'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the required input 'upscale_model' is UPSCALE_MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the required input 'upscale_model'?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the required input 'upscale_model' is torch.nn.Module."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the UpscaleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the UpscaleModelClamp node is 'upscale_model', which is the unchanged upsample model inputted into the node, allowing for seamless integration into subsequent stages of the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output 'upscale_model'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output 'upscale_model' is UPSCALE_MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output 'upscale_model'?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output 'upscale_model' is torch.nn.Module."
