        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node in ComfyUI is used to extend an image in a specified direction and generate a corresponding mask, enhancing the capability of image manipulation and extension to meet various application scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node are: image (PIL.Image), direction (str), pixels (int), and mask_padding (int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'direction' parameter determine in the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter in the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node determines the direction in which the image will be extended, affecting the overall structure and composition of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'pixels' parameter influence the output of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' parameter in the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node determines the extent to which the image will be extended, directly impacting the final dimensions and the range of inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask_padding' parameter in the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_padding' parameter in the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node is crucial for defining the extended area around the image, ensuring a smooth transition between the original and the new regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node are image (torch.Tensor) and mask (torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output mask of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node represented?",
        "answer": "The output mask of the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node is represented in a binary format, distinguishing between the original and the extended parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the WLSH_Outpaint_To_Image node is CPU."
