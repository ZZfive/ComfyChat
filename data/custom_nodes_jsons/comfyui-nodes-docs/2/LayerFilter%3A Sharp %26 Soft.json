        "question": "What is the purpose of the SharpAndSoft custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SharpAndSoft custom node in ComfyUI is used to enhance or soften details in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SharpAndSoft node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SharpAndSoft node are 'images' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'enhance' (Comfy dtype: STRING_ONEOF, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available options for the 'enhance' parameter in the SharpAndSoft node?",
        "answer": "The available options for the 'enhance' parameter in the SharpAndSoft node are 'very sharp', 'sharp', 'soft', 'very soft', and 'None'."

    {
        "question": "Which infra type does the SharpAndSoft node use?",
        "answer": "The SharpAndSoft node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SharpAndSoft node process the image when the 'enhance' parameter is set to 'very sharp'?",
        "answer": "When the 'enhance' parameter is set to 'very sharp', the SharpAndSoft node sets the filter_radius to 1, denoise to 0.6, and detail_mult to 2.8, and then processes the image using bilateral filtering and guided filtering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'enhance' parameter is set to 'None' in the SharpAndSoft node?",
        "answer": "If the 'enhance' parameter is set to 'None' in the SharpAndSoft node, no processing is applied to the image, and the original image is returned."
