        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_DiamondPanel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_DiamondPanel node is used to create visually appealing diamond-shaped panels from an image, enhancing the layout functionality by providing pattern designs that can be seamlessly integrated into various graphical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_DiamondPanel node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_DiamondPanel node are 'image', which is the core input for generating the diamond-shaped panels, and 'pattern', which determines the type of design applied to the panels, such as 'none' or 'diamond'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'drop_percentage' parameter control in the CR_DiamondPanel node?",
        "answer": "The 'drop_percentage' parameter adjusts the spacing between the diamond-shaped panels. It plays a crucial role in the overall composition by controlling the density and arrangement of the panels in the layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_DiamondPanel node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_DiamondPanel node are 'image', which represents the final diamond pattern layout, and 'show_help', which provides a link to the documentation for further assistance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_DiamondPanel node arrange the diamond-shaped panels when the 'diamond' pattern is selected?",
        "answer": "When the 'diamond' pattern is selected, the CR_DiamondPanel node creates a new image and arranges the diamond-shaped panels based on the input image's dimensions and the specified 'drop_percentage'. It uses a mask to create the diamond shape and pastes it onto the panel image at various positions to achieve the desired layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_DiamondPanel node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a link to the documentation, which is a useful resource for users seeking information on how to use the node or troubleshoot issues."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the CR_DiamondPanel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the CR_DiamondPanel node is CPU."
