        "question": "What is the purpose of the LDSRModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LDSRModelLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load and prepare an LDSR model for use, abstracting away the complexities of model retrieval and initialization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the LDSRModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the LDSRModelLoader node is 'model', which specifies the LDSR model to be loaded. It determines which model's state dictionary and configuration are used for the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LDSRModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LDSRModelLoader node is 'UPSCALE_MODEL', which provides a fully initialized and ready-to-use LDSR model that is essential for further image upscaling tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the LDSRModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LDSRModelLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LDSRModelLoader node prepare the loaded LDSR model?",
        "answer": "The LDSRModelLoader node prepares the loaded LDSR model by transferring it to the appropriate device and setting it to evaluation mode, ensuring that the model is ready for upscaling tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LDSRModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LDSRModelLoader node in ComfyUI is 'Flowty LDSR'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input type in the LDSRModelLoader node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input type in the LDSRModelLoader node specifies the LDSR model to be loaded, determining which model's state dictionary and configuration are used for the upscaling process."
