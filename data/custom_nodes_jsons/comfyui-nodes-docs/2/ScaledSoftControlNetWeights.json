        "question": "What is the purpose of the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class provides a method to generate control weights based on the provided multiplier and flip parameters for scaling and possibly flipping, contributing to the customization of the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of the base_multiplier parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class?",
        "answer": "The range of the base_multiplier parameter is from 0.0 to 1.0, allowing fine-tuning of the influence of the weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the flip_weights parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class?",
        "answer": "The flip_weights parameter is an optional switch that, when enabled, can reverse the direction of the weight application, which may be important for achieving specific effects or correcting unexpected influences in the behavior of the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class are CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS representing the generated set of control weights, and TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME which is a structured representation of the time-based control points within the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class use?",
        "answer": "The ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the base_multiplier parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class?",
        "answer": "The default value of the base_multiplier parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class is 0.825."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the flip_weights parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class?",
        "answer": "The default value of the flip_weights parameter in the ScaledSoftUniversalWeights class is False."
