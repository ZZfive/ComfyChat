        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec3UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec3UnaryCondition node is designed to perform vectorized unary operations on three-dimensional vectors in ComfyUI. It applies a specified condition to each element of the vector and returns a boolean result indicating the outcome of the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter define in the Vec3UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec3UnaryCondition node defines the unary condition to be applied to each element of the vector. It is a key from a predefined set of vector unary conditions. This parameter is crucial because it determines the specific condition that the node will evaluate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the Vec3UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the Vec3UnaryCondition node represents the three-dimensional vector to which the unary condition will be applied. It is a critical input because the operation of the node directly depends on the values within this vector. The node processes each element based on the specified condition to produce a boolean result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the Vec3UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the Vec3UnaryCondition node is a boolean value that represents the result of applying the unary condition to the input vector. It indicates whether the condition holds true for each element of the vector, providing a clear and concise evaluation of the vector's state based on the specified condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec3UnaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec3UnaryCondition node is CPU, indicating that this node is designed to run on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Vec3UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Vec3UnaryCondition node in ComfyUI is 'math/vec3', indicating that it belongs to the mathematical operations related to three-dimensional vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Vec3UnaryCondition node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the Vec3UnaryCondition node is not an output node. It is a processing node that takes inputs, applies a unary condition, and produces a boolean result."
