        "question": "What is the purpose of the DensePose preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DensePose preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to estimate human body poses using the DensePose model and overlay them on an image. It supports different models and color maps for visualization, providing a flexible approach to pose estimation and visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the DensePose preprocessor node is an image, which is the input image on which human body poses will be estimated and visualized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the DensePose preprocessor node include the model, which specifies the DensePose model used for pose estimation, and cmap, which decides the color map used for visualizing pose estimation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'model' parameter affect pose estimation in the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter allows the selection of different DensePose models for pose estimation in the DensePose preprocessor node, which may affect the accuracy and performance of the pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cmap' parameter in the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'cmap' parameter in the DensePose preprocessor node determines the color map used for visualizing pose estimation results, which can enhance the visual distinctiveness of the pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DensePose preprocessor node is an image, which is an image with estimated and visualized human body poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the DensePose preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the DensePose preprocessor node is GPU."
