        "question": "What is the main purpose of the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node in ComfyUI allows for fine-tuning the frequency of a sine curve, providing control over the oscillation speed without altering the overall shape of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input curve parameter used for in the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The input curve parameter is essential in the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node as it defines the base sine curve whose frequency will be adjusted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the adjustment parameter do in the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The adjustment parameter in the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node is used to modify the frequency of the curve by a specified value, affecting the overall oscillation speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node is an adjusted sine curve that reflects the frequency changes based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node calculate the adjusted frequency?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node calculates the adjusted frequency by first calculating the original frequency as the reciprocal of the wavelength, then adding the adjustment value to it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node return as output?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalAdjustFrequency node returns a tuple containing the adjusted curve and the same adjusted curve, both as keyframed curves."
