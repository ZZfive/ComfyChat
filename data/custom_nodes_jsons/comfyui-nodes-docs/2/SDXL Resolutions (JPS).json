        "question": "What is the purpose of the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node is designed to calculate and return width and height dimensions based on predefined resolution sets. It supports various aspect ratios and resolutions, making it convenient to select appropriate sizes for different image orientations and sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node require?",
        "answer": "The SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node requires a mandatory input named 'resolution'. This input is specified as a string from a predefined list that determines the requested resolution. The resolution choice affects both the width and height output dimensions by deciding the aspect ratio and size of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types returned by the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node returns two output types: 'width' and 'height'. These are calculated based on the selected resolution and represent the dimensions of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node calculate the dimensions of an image?",
        "answer": "The SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node calculates image dimensions by selecting an appropriate resolution from the predefined list based on the provided input. The width and height of the image are then determined according to this selected resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes that might be useful with the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that might be used in conjunction with the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node include [CLIPTextEncodeSDXL](../../Comfy/Nodes/CLIPTextEncodeSDXL.md) and [Efficient Loader](../../efficiency-nodes-comfyui/Nodes/Efficient Loader.md)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'width' output from the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output from the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node is of type 'INT', which means it returns an integer value representing the width of the calculated image size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'height' output from the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' output from the SDXL Resolutions (JPS) node is also of type 'INT', indicating it provides an integer value that represents the height of the calculated image size."
