        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'extra_directions' input in the LLMRegexCreator node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_directions' input in the LLMRegexCreator node is an optional input that allows users to provide additional instructions or constraints to guide the language model in generating the regex pattern. These instructions can optimize the output by providing more context or specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LLMRegexCreator node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LLMRegexCreator node is 'regex_pattern', which is the generated regular expression pattern based on the provided description and optional extra instructions."
