        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComposeVec3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec3 node is used to create a Vec3 object from three separate float values, making it convenient to create and manipulate three-dimensional vectors in mathematical or geometric contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "The ComposeVec3 node requires three input types: x, y, and z, all of which are of the FLOAT data type in ComfyUI and float data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the x coordinate represent in the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "In the ComposeVec3 node, the x coordinate represents the position of the vector along the horizontal axis in three-dimensional space, influencing the direction and magnitude of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the y coordinate represent in the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "In the ComposeVec3 node, the y coordinate determines the position of the vector on the vertical axis in three-dimensional space, which is crucial for establishing the direction and influence of the vector in the coordinate system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the z coordinate represent in the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "In the ComposeVec3 node, the z coordinate determines the position of the vector on the depth axis in three-dimensional space, playing a vital role in the overall spatial representation of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ComposeVec3 node is a Vec3 object, which encapsulates the three input values and represents a vector in three-dimensional space that can be used for various mathematical and geometric operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ComposeVec3 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ComposeVec3 node is CPU."
