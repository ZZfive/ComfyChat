        "question": "What is the purpose of the SvgImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SvgImage node in ComfyUI is designed to process SVG images, converting them into a tensor format suitable for further operations and analysis in a neural network framework. It focuses on the conversion and adaptation of SVG data for integration with deep learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'upload' parameter in the SvgImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'upload' parameter is crucial for the SvgImage node's operation. It contains the SVG image data and related metadata, directly influencing the node's ability to process and convert the SVG into a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SvgImage node?",
        "answer": "The SvgImage node has two output types: 'IMAGE' and 'layers'. 'IMAGE' provides a tensor representation of the input SVG image for further processing in a deep learning environment, while 'layers' contains individual components or layers extracted from the SVG data for detailed analysis or manipulation of the image structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the SvgImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the SvgImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'run' function in the SvgImage node do?",
        "answer": "The 'run' function in the SvgImage node takes the 'upload' parameter as input, converts the SVG image to a tensor, extracts layers from the SVG data, and returns both the tensor representation of the image and the extracted layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'IMAGE' output in the SvgImage node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'IMAGE' output in the SvgImage node is Tensor (torch.Tensor in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'layers' output in the SvgImage node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'layers' output in the SvgImage node is List[Any] (List[Any] in Python)."
