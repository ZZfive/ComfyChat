        "question": "What is the purpose of the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node is designed to adjust the aspect ratio of the original pose within the AnimateDiff framework, specifically for camera control applications. It modifies the pose's dimensions to match the new aspect ratio, ensuring accurate rendering of animations and visual effects according to the desired spatial dimensions."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node are: poses (a list of poses to be adjusted, where each pose is a list of floats representing camera control points' spatial and rotation parameters), orig_pose_width (the original width of the pose used for calculating the new aspect ratio), and orig_pose_height (the original height of the pose used for calculating the new aspect ratio)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node is cameractrl_poses, which represents the adjusted poses after applying the new aspect ratio, ready for further processing or animation within the AnimateDiff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node use?",
        "answer": "The Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node is Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/CameraCtrl/poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for orig_pose_width in the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The default value for orig_pose_width in the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node is 1280."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for orig_pose_height in the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The default value for orig_pose_height in the Replace Orig. Pose Aspect Ratio node is 720."
