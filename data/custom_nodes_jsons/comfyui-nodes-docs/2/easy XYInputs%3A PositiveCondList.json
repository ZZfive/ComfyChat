        "question": "What is the purpose of the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node in ComfyUI is designed to process a series of positive conditions and transform them into a structured format suitable for plotting or further analysis. It focuses on identifying and organizing these conditions according to positive attributes, making it convenient to visualize or manipulate data points in a 'positive' context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node is 'positive', which accepts a series of conditions, each representing a positive attribute or criterion. This input is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the conditions to be processed and structured for output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node?",
        "answer": "The output of the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node is a structured representation of the positive conditions, including their indices and corresponding conditions, which can be directly used for plotting or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node in ComfyUI is 'EasyUse/XY Inputs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute in the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node's source code indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'FUNCTION' attribute in the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node's source code indicates the function name, which is 'xy_value'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node process the 'positive' input to generate the output?",
        "answer": "The XYplot_Positive_Cond_List node processes the 'positive' input by iterating over each condition in the input, assigning an index to each condition, and then returning a tuple containing a dictionary with the axis name, the list of indices as values, and the list of conditions. If the values list is empty, it returns None."
