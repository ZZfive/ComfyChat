        "question": "What is the purpose of the GradientImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GradientImage node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a gradient image from a specified start color to an end color. It seamlessly integrates with image processing libraries to create visually appealing gradient effects that can be used for various applications such as backgrounds or design elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the GradientImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the GradientImage node are width, height, start_color_hex, and end_color_hex."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the width parameter affect the generated gradient image?",
        "answer": "The width parameter determines the width of the generated gradient image. It is a key factor in setting the image dimensions, which in turn affects the overall visual layout and design."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the start_color_hex parameter specify?",
        "answer": "The start_color_hex parameter specifies the hexadecimal color code at the beginning of the gradient. It is a basic input that determines the starting point of the color transition in the gradient image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the GradientImage node provide?",
        "answer": "The GradientImage node provides two output types: IMAGE and MASK. The IMAGE output provides the generated gradient image, while the MASK output includes a mask image that can be used for selective editing or applying specific effects to certain areas of the gradient image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the GradientImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the GradientImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the generated gradient image saved and returned by the GradientImage node?",
        "answer": "The generated gradient image is saved as a PNG file with a specific filename and counter in a temporary directory. The image is then converted to a tensor using pil2tensor and returned along with the mask as the result."
