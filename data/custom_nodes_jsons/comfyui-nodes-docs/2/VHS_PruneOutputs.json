        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'prune_outputs' method in the PruneOutputs class?",
        "answer": "The 'prune_outputs' method is designed to manage and clean up intermediate and utility files generated in video processing workflows. It intelligently decides which files to delete based on specified options, ensuring an organized directory structure and retaining only necessary files."

    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'filenames' parameter in the PruneOutputs class?",
        "answer": "The 'filenames' parameter is a list of file names that the node operates on. It plays a crucial role in identifying the files to be pruned. The node uses this list to determine the scope of its operation and execute the file deletion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'options' parameter specify in the PruneOutputs class?",
        "answer": "The 'options' parameter in the PruneOutputs class determines the pruning behavior of the node. It specifies whether to delete intermediate files, utility files, or both. This parameter is essential as it guides the node's decision process regarding which files to remove."

    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'prune_outputs' method in the PruneOutputs class?",
        "answer": "The 'prune_outputs' method does not produce any output because its primary function is to delete files. It is a utility method focused on maintaining cleanliness and organization in the file system rather than generating new data or results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the PruneOutputs class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the PruneOutputs class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the PruneOutputs class belong?",
        "answer": "The PruneOutputs class belongs to the Video Helper Suite category, denoted as 'ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢'."

    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'options' parameter is set to 'All' in the 'prune_outputs' method?",
        "answer": "If the 'options' parameter is set to 'All' in the 'prune_outputs' method, all files in the 'filenames[1]' list will be added to the 'delete_list' and subsequently removed, including intermediate, utility, and other files."
