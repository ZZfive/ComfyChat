        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is designed to simplify the process of loading upscaler models for image enhancement tasks. It abstracts the complexity of model loading, making it possible to seamlessly integrate upscaling functionality into larger workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'upscaler_name' parameter in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscaler_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific upscaler model to be loaded. It plays a core role in the node's operation as it determines which model will be used for image upscaling, directly affecting the quality and characteristics of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'UPSCALE_MODEL' output represent in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'UPSCALE_MODEL' output represents the loaded upscaler model, which is a fundamental component for subsequent image processing tasks. It encapsulates the model's architecture and learned parameters, ready to be applied to image upscaling according to the workflow's requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which upscale model loader is used in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader class?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader class uses the upscale model loader from `comfy_extras.nodes_upscale_model.UpscaleModelLoader()`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'load_upscaler' function in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'load_upscaler' function in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader class is 'UPSCALE_MODEL', which is of type `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node placed?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is placed in the 'Searge/_deprecated_/Files' category."
