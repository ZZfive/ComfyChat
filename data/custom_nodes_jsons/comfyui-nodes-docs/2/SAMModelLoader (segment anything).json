        "question": "What is the purpose of the SAMModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAMModelLoader node is responsible for loading and preparing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for image segmentation tasks in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the model_name parameter in the SAMModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The model_name parameter is crucial for identifying the specific Segment Anything Model to be loaded. It guides the node to the correct model configuration and ensures that appropriate resources are allocated for the task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SAMModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SAMModelLoader node is the loaded Segment Anything Model (SAM_MODEL), which is ready to be used for image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the SAM_MODEL output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the SAM_MODEL output is torch.nn.Module."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the model_name parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the model_name parameter is str (string)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the SAMModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the SAMModelLoader node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SAMModelLoader node load the Segment Anything Model?",
        "answer": "The SAMModelLoader node loads the Segment Anything Model using the load_sam_model function, which takes the model_name as input and returns the loaded model."
