        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWStringToFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWStringToFloat node is designed to convert the string representation of a floating-point number into an actual floating-point value, facilitating the transformation of text data into a numerical format for further processing or calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the JWStringToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the JWStringToFloat node is 'text', which is a string representing a floating-point number. This input is essential for converting the textual representation into a numerical floating-point value."
