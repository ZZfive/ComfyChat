        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateGradientMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateGradientMask node is designed to generate gradient masks that can be used for various image processing tasks. It creates masks by calculating linear gradients over the image width and adjusting the gradients based on the current frame in the frame sequence, allowing for dynamic masking effects that can change over time or across different parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter in CreateGradientMask do?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter determines whether to invert the generated gradient mask. This is useful for creating complementary masks or applying different effects based on the direction of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'frames' parameter in the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter specifies the number of frames for which masks are to be generated. It directly affects the output batch size and is crucial for creating animations or effects that vary over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' parameter affect the gradient mask created by CreateGradientMask?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter sets the width of the gradient mask in pixels. It is essential for defining the spatial resolution of the mask and the granularity of the gradient's influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'height' parameter play in the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' parameter sets the height of the gradient mask in pixels. It works in conjunction with the 'width' parameter to determine the overall size of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CreateGradientMask node is a tensor representing the gradient mask (MASK). It is a key component for subsequent image operations and effect applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CreateGradientMask node is CPU."
