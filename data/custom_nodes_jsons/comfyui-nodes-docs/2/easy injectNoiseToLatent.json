        "question": "What is the purpose of the injectNoiseToLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The injectNoiseToLatent node in ComfyUI is designed to modify latent representations by injecting noise, allowing for the generation of diversified outputs from given inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the injectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the injectNoiseToLatent node are 'strength' ( FLOAT ), 'normalize' ( BOOLEAN ), and 'average' ( BOOLEAN )."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the injectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the injectNoiseToLatent node specifies the intensity of the noise to be injected into the latent space, affecting the strength of the modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the noise be selectively injected into certain areas of the latent space using the injectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The injectNoiseToLatent node allows for selective injection of noise into certain areas of the latent space by using an optional 'mask' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mix_randn_amount' parameter in the injectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'mix_randn_amount' parameter in the injectNoiseToLatent node specifies the amount of random noise to be mixed into the noised latent representation, introducing additional randomness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the injectNoiseToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the injectNoiseToLatent node is 'latent', which represents the modified latent representation after noise injection."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the injectNoiseToLatent node support conditional application of noise based on a mask?",
        "answer": "Yes, the injectNoiseToLatent node supports conditional application of noise based on a mask, allowing for localized modifications in the latent space."
