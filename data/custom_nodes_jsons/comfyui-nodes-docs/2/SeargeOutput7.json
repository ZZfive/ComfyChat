        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeOutput7 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput7 node in ComfyUI is a data demultiplexer interface that separates input data into different streams for further processing. It is designed to enhance the workflow by organizing and prioritizing data streams, ensuring that specific data attributes receive the appropriate attention they require."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'parameters' input in the SeargeOutput7 node?",
        "answer": "The 'parameters' input is crucial in the SeargeOutput7 node because it contains the data that the node will demultiplex, allowing for the separation of different attributes according to a predefined structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeOutput7 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput7 node has two output types: 'parameters' and 'lora_strength'. The 'parameters' output retains the original structure of the input data, ensuring that the demultiplexed data is organized and easily accessible for subsequent operations. The 'lora_strength' output represents a specific attribute demultiplexed from the input data, highlighting its importance in the data processing workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the SeargeOutput7 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput7 node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SeargeOutput7 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput7 node belongs to the 'Searge/_deprecated_/UI/Outputs' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SeargeOutput7 node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the SeargeOutput7 node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names of the SeargeOutput7 node?",
        "answer": "The return types of the SeargeOutput7 node are 'PARAMETERS' and 'FLOAT', and the return names are 'parameters' and 'lora_strength'."
