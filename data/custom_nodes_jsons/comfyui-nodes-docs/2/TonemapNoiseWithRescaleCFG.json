        "question": "What is the purpose of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the visual quality of generated images by applying tone mapping techniques combined with denoising strategies. It adjusts the contrast and brightness of the image through complex rescaling operations to optimize its appearance and reduce noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node requires the 'model' parameter, which represents the generative model that the node will operate on. It is the basis for applying tone mapping and rescaling operations to generate high-quality images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tonemap_multiplier' parameter control in the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The 'tonemap_multiplier' parameter in the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node controls the intensity of the tone mapping effect applied to the image. It is crucial for fine-tuning the visual results to achieve the desired contrast and brightness levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'rescale_multiplier' parameter play in the denoising process of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The 'rescale_multiplier' parameter in the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node determines the balance between the rescaled and original image values during the denoising process. It plays an important role in reducing noise while preserving image details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The output of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node is a modified generative model with an enhanced sampler configuration function that combines tone mapping and denoising techniques to produce visually more appealing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node defines the input types, output types, function category, and the main patch function that applies the tone mapping and rescaling operations to the generative model."
