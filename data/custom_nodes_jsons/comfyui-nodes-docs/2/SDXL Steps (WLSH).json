        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'set_steps' method in WLSH_SDXL_Steps?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the 'set_steps' method is to configure the step length parameters for a weighted least squares problem. It is crucial for determining the sequence and interval of steps, which can significantly influence the results of the numerical process."

    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the 'set_steps' method?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'set_steps' method are: 'precondition' which is an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), 'base' which is also an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and 'total' which is also an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."

        "question": "What are the output types of the 'set_steps' method?",
        "answer": "The output types of the 'set_steps' method are: 'pre' which is an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), 'base' which is also an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and 'total' which is also an integer (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."

        "question": "What is the intended use of the WLSH_SDXL_Steps node?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_SDXL_Steps node is designed for use in the WLSH Nodes category with a number of steps. It is used for processing numbers with the category 'WLSH Nodes/number'."

    {
        "question": "What are the limitations on the 'precondition' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'precondition' parameter can take any integer value between 1 and 10000. By default, it is set to 3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations on the 'base' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'base' parameter can also take any integer value between 1 and 10000. By default, it is set to 12."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations on the 'total' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'total' parameter specifies the maximum number of steps that will be taken. It must be an integer between 1 and 10000. By default, it is set to 20."
