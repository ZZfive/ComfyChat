        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToColorList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToColorList node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a set of color-related data into a structured list format, specifically for handling color information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter represents the color data set to be converted into a list. This parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the content of the generated color list, which in turn affects subsequent processing and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToColorList node is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToColorList node is List[Union[str, Tuple[int, int, int]]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'color' output represent in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The 'color' output represents the structured color data list, organized for efficient processing and manipulation in subsequent color-related computational tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'color' output in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'color' output in the ToColorList node is COLOR."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'color' output in the ToColorList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'color' output in the ToColorList node is List[Union[str, Tuple[int, int, int]]]."
