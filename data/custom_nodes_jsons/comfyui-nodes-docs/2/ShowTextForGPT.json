        "question": "What is the purpose of the ShowTextForGPT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ShowTextForGPT node is designed to process and output text data. It accepts various text inputs and writes them to an output file, ensuring each string is appropriately handled and stored. This node is crucial for tasks that require text generation and subsequent file management, providing a streamlined workflow for text processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'text' input parameter in the ShowTextForGPT node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input parameter is essential as it represents the data that will be processed by the node. It is the main input that determines the content and nature of the output. Without this input, the node would not have any data to process, making it a critical component for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'output_dir' parameter in the ShowTextForGPT node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_dir' parameter is used to specify the location where the processed text will be saved. This impacts the organization and accessibility of the output files, allowing for better management and retrieval of results. This parameter is optional but enhances the functionality of the node when used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ui.text' output parameter represent in the ShowTextForGPT node?",
        "answer": "The 'ui.text' output parameter serves as the representation of the processed text data. It directly reflects the input and showcases the node's ability to effectively process and output text. This output is important for visualizing results within the user interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'result' output parameter in the ShowTextForGPT node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output parameter is the collection of processed text data, indicating the successful completion of the node's operation. It is a crucial output as it provides evidence of the node's functionality and the effectiveness of the text processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the ShowTextForGPT node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the ShowTextForGPT node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the ShowTextForGPT node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the ShowTextForGPT node defines the class 'ShowTextForGPT' and includes methods for specifying input and output types, the main run function for processing text, and the logic for handling input parameters and generating output files based on the processed text."
