        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node in ComfyUI is designed to reconstruct missing or damaged parts of an image by utilizing specific repair techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'img' parameter in the Inpaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'img' parameter represents the image that needs to be repaired. It is crucial because it provides the visual data for performing the repair operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask' parameter assist in the inpainting process?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter specifies the areas in the image that need to be repaired. It plays a key role in guiding the repair process to focus on the target areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'radius' parameter determine in the Inpaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter determines the size of the neighborhood around each point during the repair, affecting the smoothness and range of the repair effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'flag' parameter in the Inpaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'flag' parameter allows selecting the repair algorithm to be used, providing flexibility to choose the method that best suits the specific needs of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inpaint node output after processing?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inpaint node is the repaired image, where the specified areas have been reconstructed using the selected repair technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for running the Inpaint node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the Inpaint node is GPU."
