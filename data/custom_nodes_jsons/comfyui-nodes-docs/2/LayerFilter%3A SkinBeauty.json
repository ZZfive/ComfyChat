        "question": "What is the purpose of the SkinBeauty node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SkinBeauty node in ComfyUI is used to apply a skin smoothing effect to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SkinBeauty node?",
        "answer": "The SkinBeauty node requires four inputs: the image, the smoothness level, the highlight threshold, and the opacity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'image' input in the SkinBeauty node?",
        "answer": "In the SkinBeauty node, the 'image' input is of the Comfy data type IMAGE, which corresponds to a torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the smoothness level controlled in the SkinBeauty node?",
        "answer": "The smoothness level in the SkinBeauty node is controlled by an integer value ranging from 1 to 64, with a default value of 20."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter in the SkinBeauty node control?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in the SkinBeauty node controls the highlight threshold, which is an integer value ranging from -255 to 255 with a default value of -10."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of the 'opacity' parameter in the SkinBeauty node?",
        "answer": "The 'opacity' parameter in the SkinBeauty node is an integer value ranging from 0 to 100, with a default value of 100."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SkinBeauty node?",
        "answer": "The SkinBeauty node outputs two values: the processed image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and a beauty mask (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SkinBeauty node use?",
        "answer": "The SkinBeauty node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
