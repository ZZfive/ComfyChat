        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Seed_and_Int node in ComfyUI generates a pairing of a seed and an integer value based on the given seed, which is used to create and manage unique identifiers in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Seed_and_Int node requires an input type of 'seed' which is an integer (INT) and is crucial for ensuring consistency and reproducibility of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Seed_and_Int node outputs two types: 'seed' which is the original input seed (INT), and 'int_representation' which is a unique output derived from the input seed (Dict[str, int])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seed' output in the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' output in the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node is the original input seed, indicating its role as an identifier in the operation. The integer output is a conversion of the seed, showing its importance in the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'int_representation' output in the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node?",
        "answer": "The 'int_representation' output in the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node is derived from the input seed and serves as a unique output that is indispensable in the functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Seed_and_Int node uses the infra type: CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the WLSH_Seed_and_Int node in ComfyUI is 'WLSH Nodes/number'."
