        "question": "What is the purpose of the SMPLShapeParameters node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SMPLShapeParameters node is designed to adjust the shape parameters of the SMPL model according to various body measurements, such as size, thickness, upper body height, lower body height, muscle mass, legs, chest, waist height, waist width, and arms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the 'smpl' parameter in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The input type for the 'smpl' parameter is 'SMPL' in ComfyUI and 'dict' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the SMPL model in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter represents the overall size of the SMPL model and affects its proportions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SMPLShapeParameters node is 'SMPL' in ComfyUI and 'dict' in Python, representing the modified SMPL model with adjusted shape parameters based on the input measurements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'chest' parameter influence the SMPL model in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'chest' parameter modifies the size of the chest, affecting the width and appearance of the torso."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is theinfra type for the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SMPLShapeParameters node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'muscle_mass' parameter in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'muscle_mass' parameter is 0."
