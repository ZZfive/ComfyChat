        "question": "What is the purpose of the FeatheredMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FeatheredMask node in ComfyUI is designed to process and enhance mask images by applying a feathering effect, making the mask edges blend more naturally and seamlessly with the surrounding image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mask' parameter in the FeatheredMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is the main input of the FeatheredMask node, representing the image mask to be processed. It plays a key role in determining the final output of the node as the feathering effect is directly applied to this mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_offset' parameter affect the feathering effect in the FeatheredMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_offset' parameter controls the initial distance from the mask edge where the feathering effect begins. It is important because it determines the starting point of the smooth transition, thus influencing the overall appearance of the feathered mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'feathering_weight' parameter adjust in the FeatheredMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'feathering_weight' parameter adjusts the strength of the feathering effect in the FeatheredMask node. It is important because it allows fine-tuning the softness and blending of the mask edges, ensuring visually pleasing results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' output contain in the FeatheredMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' output contains the mask images with the feathering effect applied. It is important as it represents the final product of the node's operation, ready for further use or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the FeatheredMask node use?",
        "answer": "The FeatheredMask node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FeatheredMask node apply the feathering effect to the mask images?",
        "answer": "The FeatheredMask node applies the feathering effect to the mask images by using techniques such as edge detection, dilation, and Gaussian blur. It iteratively adjusts the mask based on the 'start_offset' and 'feathering_weight' parameters to achieve the desired feathering effect."
