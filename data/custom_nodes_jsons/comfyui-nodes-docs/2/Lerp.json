        "question": "What is the purpose of the Lerp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node in ComfyUI performs linear interpolation between two values, providing a smooth transition influenced by the strength parameter and the current frame in the image sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'num_Images' parameter define in the Lerp node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_Images' parameter defines the total number of frames or images in the sequence, which affects the step size of the interpolation and is crucial for determining the granularity of the transition between values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the interpolation in the Lerp node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter controls the degree of interpolation between the start and end values. It is a key factor in the speed at which the transition occurs within the image sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'current_frame' parameter in the Lerp node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter specifies the current position within the image sequence. It is essential for calculating the current state of the interpolation at any given point in time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Lerp node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Lerp node represents the result of the linear interpolation, providing a value that indicates the current state of the transition based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'frame_index' output useful in the Lerp node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_index' output indicates the frame number used to calculate the current interpolation state, which is useful for aligning with other sequence-based processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Lerp node use in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node uses the CPU infrastructure type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Lerp node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node belongs to the 'FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/WaveNodes' category in ComfyUI."
