        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node in ComfyUI is used to create a new sigma schedule by calculating the weighted average of two provided sigma schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node are schedule_A (the first sigma schedule to mix), schedule_B (the second sigma schedule to mix), and weight_A (the weighted factor for the first sigma schedule)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the weight_A input determine in the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node?",
        "answer": "The weight_A input in the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node determines the proportion of characteristics from the first sigma schedule in the final mixed schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node is a SIGMA_SCHEDULE, which represents the resulting sigma schedule after mixing the two input schedules based on the specified weighted factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node belongs to the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/sample settings/sigma schedule' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node do in its 'get_sigma_schedule' function?",
        "answer": "In the 'get_sigma_schedule' function, the Sigma Schedule Weighted Mean node validates the compatibility of the two input sigma schedules, calculates the new sigmas using the weighted average formula, creates a clone of the first schedule, sets the new sigmas in the cloned schedule, and returns the resulting combined schedule."
