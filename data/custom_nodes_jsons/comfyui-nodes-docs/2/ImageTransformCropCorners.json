        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageTransformCropCorners node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformCropCorners node is used to crop the corners of an image and apply rounded corners with a specified radius. It supports selective rounding of each corner and uses supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) for higher quality results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageTransformCropCorners node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageTransformCropCorners node are: images (input image for corner cropping), radius (radius of the rounded corners), top_left_corner, top_right_corner, bottom_right_corner, bottom_left_corner (flags indicating whether to round each specific corner), SSAA (supersampling anti-aliasing factor), and method (resizing method used in the SSAA process)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ImageTransformCropCorners node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformCropCorners node outputs an image that has been cropped and rounded at the specified corners."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) in the ImageTransformCropCorners node?",
        "answer": "Supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) is used in the ImageTransformCropCorners node to improve the quality of the rounded corners by reducing aliasing artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available methods for resizing in the SSAA process?",
        "answer": "The available methods for resizing in the SSAA process are: lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageTransformCropCorners node handle selective rounding of corners?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformCropCorners node uses boolean flags (top_left_corner, top_right_corner, bottom_right_corner, bottom_left_corner) to determine whether to apply rounding to each specific corner of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImageTransformCropCorners node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImageTransformCropCorners node is GPU."
