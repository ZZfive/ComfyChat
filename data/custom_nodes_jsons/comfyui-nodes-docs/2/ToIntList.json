        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToIntList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToIntList node in ComfyUI is designed to consolidate multiple integer inputs into a single list. This functionality is crucial in scenarios where multiple integers need to be processed or manipulated as a whole, simplifying the workflow involving multiple integer values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToIntList node specifies the number of integer inputs to be aggregated into the list. This parameter plays a key role in the node's operation by determining the size of the resulting list and dictating the number of integer values to be considered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'inputs_len' parameter is of the data type INT. In Python, it corresponds to the int data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ToIntList node is a list composed of the integer inputs provided to the node. This list serves as a collective set of individual integers, facilitating operations that require multiple integers to be handled as a unified structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output in the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the output data type of the ToIntList node is INT. In Python, it corresponds to the List[int] data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the ToIntList node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code for the ToIntList node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the ToIntList node is as follows: ```python class ToIntList(metaclass=MakeListMeta): TYPE = \"INT\" ```"
