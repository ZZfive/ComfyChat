        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec4ScalarOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4ScalarOperation node in ComfyUI performs scalar operations on a four-dimensional vector, providing a way to manipulate vector data through various mathematical operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'op' parameter in the Vec4ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Vec4ScalarOperation node defines the specific scalar operation to be performed on the vector. It is crucial as it determines the mathematical function applied to each component of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the Vec4ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the four-dimensional vector on which the scalar operation will be performed. It is essential as it serves as the primary input for the node's operation to produce the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'b' parameter in the Vec4ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter is the scalar value, a floating-point number, that will be used together with vector 'a' in the operation defined by 'op'. It plays an important role in the computation as it directly influences the outcome of the vector transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the Vec4ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the Vec4ScalarOperation node represents the result of the scalar operation performed on the input vector 'a'. It contains the outcome of applying the specified mathematical function to each component of the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Vec4ScalarOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Vec4ScalarOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Vec4ScalarOperation node classified?",
        "answer": "The Vec4ScalarOperation node is classified under the 'math/vec4' category."
