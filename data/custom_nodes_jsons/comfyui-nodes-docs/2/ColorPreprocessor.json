        "question": "What is the purpose of the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorPreprocessor node is designed to process images by detecting and annotating colors using a dedicated color detection model. This preprocessing step is crucial for tasks that require color analysis or modification before further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ColorPreprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed for color detection and annotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ColorPreprocessor node is resolution, which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be adjusted before processing. This parameter affects the accuracy and performance of color detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ColorPreprocessor node is an image, which is the image after color detection and annotation processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ColorPreprocessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ColorPreprocessor node belong?",
        "answer": "The ColorPreprocessor node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/T2IAdapter-only category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the execute function of the ColorPreprocessor node do?",
        "answer": "The execute function of the ColorPreprocessor node takes an input image and an optional resolution parameter, and returns the processed image after color detection and annotation using the ColorDetector class from the controlnet_aux.color module."
