        "question": "What is the purpose of the Checkpoint Selector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Selector node in ComfyUI simplifies the process of selecting checkpoint files from a predefined list, abstracting the flow of identifying and selecting appropriate checkpoint files for operations like model loading or initialization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the Checkpoint Selector node?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Selector node requires an input type of 'ckpt_name', which specifies the name of the checkpoint file to be selected. This parameter is crucial for determining which checkpoint file will be used for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the 'ckpt_name' input in the Checkpoint Selector node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the 'ckpt_name' input in the Checkpoint Selector node is COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'ckpt_name' input in the Checkpoint Selector node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'ckpt_name' input in the Checkpoint Selector node is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Checkpoint Selector node produce?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Selector node outputs the selected checkpoint file name ('ckpt_name'), which is essential for downstream tasks that require a specific checkpoint file, such as model loading or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Checkpoint Selector node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Checkpoint Selector node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Checkpoint Selector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Checkpoint Selector node in ComfyUI is ImageSaverTools/utils."
