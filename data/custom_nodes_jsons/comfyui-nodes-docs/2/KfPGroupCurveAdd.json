        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfPGroupCurveAdd node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfPGroupCurveAdd node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the integration of curves into parameter groups, enhancing the overall structure and functionality of the data model. It simplifies the process of combining keyframed animation elements with parameter setups, thereby increasing the efficiency of data manipulation within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfPGroupCurveAdd node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KfPGroupCurveAdd node are 'parameter_group' and 'curve'. The 'parameter_group' is essential as it forms the basis for curve integration, while the 'curve' input is crucial for introducing dynamic variation into the parameter group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfPGroupCurveAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfPGroupCurveAdd node is 'result', which represents the merged output of the parameter group and curve, signifying successful integration. It encapsulates the combined properties and behaviors of the two inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfPGroupCurveAdd node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfPGroupCurveAdd node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the main function of the KfPGroupCurveAdd node work?",
        "answer": "The main function of the KfPGroupCurveAdd node takes two inputs: 'parameter_group' and 'curve'. It creates deep copies of both inputs and returns a tuple containing the sum of the parameter group and curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the main function in the KfPGroupCurveAdd node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the main function in the KfPGroupCurveAdd node is a tuple containing the merged output of the parameter group and curve, denoted as ('PARAMETER_GROUP',)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the KfPGroupCurveAdd node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the KfPGroupCurveAdd node is not an output node. It is used for integrating curves into parameter groups within the ComfyUI system."
