        "question": "What is the purpose of the Load image with metadata node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load image with metadata node in ComfyUI is designed to load an image along with its associated metadata, facilitating the integration and manipulation of image data in broader data processing or analysis workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the Load image with metadata node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the Load image with metadata node represents the target image file to be loaded. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it determines the source of the visual content and associated metadata, which is essential for subsequent processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' output represent in the Load image with metadata node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output in the Load image with metadata node represents a mask generated from the image, used for operations that require differentiation of image regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'prompt' output in the Load image with metadata node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' output in the Load image with metadata node provides contextual or instructional information related to the image, extracted from the image's metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Metadata RAW' output in the Load image with metadata node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'Metadata RAW' output in the Load image with metadata node contains comprehensive metadata associated with the image, encapsulating all contextual information extracted during the loading process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Load image with metadata node handle image transparency?",
        "answer": "If the image contains an alpha channel ('A' in the image bands), the Load image with metadata node generates a mask based on the alpha channel. Otherwise, it creates a mask filled with zeros."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the 'image' in the Load image with metadata node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the Load image with metadata node is a torch.Tensor representing the loaded image, with pixel values normalized between 0 and 1."
