        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node in ComfyUI is designed to color specific facial parts in pose keypoint data, allowing for the use of custom colors for each facial part."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node are pose_kps (POSE_KEYPOINT), mode (COMBO[STRING]), and colors for various facial parts such as skin, left_eye, right_eye, nose, upper_lip, inner_mouth, and lower_lip (all STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node is an image (IMAGE), which is a tensor representation of the pose frame with colored facial parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node handle different drawing modes?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node handles different drawing modes by either drawing circles for each keypoint or filling polygons for specific facial parts based on the selected mode (point or polygon)."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/Pose Keypoint Postprocess category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node process the pose_kps input data?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node processes the pose_kps input data by iterating through each person and facial part in the pose frame, applying the specified colors to the corresponding keypoints, and generating a colored output image."
