    {
        "question": "What are the configuration options for cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The configuration options for cg-noise include 'cg_noise_weight', which is the weight 'x' determining the influence of the variation on the initial noise, and 'cg_variation_seed', which is the seed used for the variation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for 'cg_noise_weight' in cg-noise?",
        "answer": "The default value for 'cg_noise_weight' in cg-noise is 0.15."
