        "question": "What is the purpose of the DensePosePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DensePosePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to estimate dense human poses from an image. It preprocesses the image using a selected DensePose model and color map to generate detailed body pose estimates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the DensePosePreprocessor node is an image that needs to be processed to estimate dense poses. This is the main input image for performing pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be specified for the DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters that can be specified for the DensePosePreprocessor node include the DensePose model, color map, and resolution. The model selection may affect the accuracy and performance of pose estimation, the color map determines the visualization of the pose estimation results, and the resolution is the size to which the input image will be resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DensePosePreprocessor node is an image visualizing the dense pose estimate according to the selected color map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for running the DensePosePreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the DensePosePreprocessor node be used in a ComfyUI workflow?",
        "answer": "The DensePosePreprocessor node can be used in a ComfyUI workflow by connecting an image input node to its image input, specifying the desired DensePose model, color map, and resolution, and then connecting its output to subsequent nodes for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available options for the 'model' parameter in the DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The available options for the 'model' parameter in the DensePosePreprocessor node are 'densepose_r50_fpn_dl.torchscript' and 'densepose_r101_fpn_dl.torchscript', with 'densepose_r50_fpn_dl.torchscript' being the default model."
