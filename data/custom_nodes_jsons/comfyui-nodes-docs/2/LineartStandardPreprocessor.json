        "question": "What is the purpose of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LineartStandardPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to extract line art from an image using standard methods. It pre-processes the image to highlight and refine line details, making it suitable for applications that require clear line depiction, such as digital art and animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the LineartStandardPreprocessor node is an image that needs to be processed for line art extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'guassian_sigma' parameter control in the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'guassian_sigma' parameter in the LineartStandardPreprocessor node specifies the sigma value for the Gaussian blur applied to the image, which affects the smoothness of the extracted lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'intensity_threshold' parameter affect the output of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity_threshold' parameter in the LineartStandardPreprocessor node determines the threshold for intensity differences, which influences the differentiation between the line art and the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'resolution' parameter in the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the LineartStandardPreprocessor node determines the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, which affects the level of detail in the extracted line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node is an image with enhanced and refined lines, suitable for further processing or direct use in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LineartStandardPreprocessor node run on?",
        "answer": "The LineartStandardPreprocessor node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
