        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node is designed to process and manipulate text tokens. It enhances input text by adding custom tokens, which can be used for various purposes such as timestamps, user identification, or device information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality of the 'tokens' parameter in the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node?",
        "answer": "The 'tokens' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it defines the custom tokens to be added to the text. These tokens can represent dynamic data such as current time, hostname, or other system-specific information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_current_tokens' parameter in the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node do?",
        "answer": "The 'print_current_tokens' parameter is an optional switch that, when set to 'true', instructs the node to print the current state of the custom tokens. This feature is very useful for debugging and verifying the tokens being applied to the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'tokens' parameter in the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node represent?",
        "answer": "The output 'tokens' parameter represents the modified text with newly added or updated custom tokens. This output can be used for further processing or analysis in downstream tasks, allowing seamless integration of dynamic text elements into various workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node falls under the 'WAS Suite/Text/Tokens' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the WAS_Text_Add_Tokens node is an output node in ComfyUI."
