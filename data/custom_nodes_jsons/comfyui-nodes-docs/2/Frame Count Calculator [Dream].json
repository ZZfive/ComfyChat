        "question": "What is the purpose of the Frame Count Calculator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Frame Count Calculator node is used to calculate the total number of frames based on a given time duration and frame rate. It takes into account hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to provide an accurate frame count calculation, which is essential for time-sensitive animation and video processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Frame Count Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Count Calculator node are: hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, and frames_per_second. All of these inputs are of the INT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frames_per_second' input affect the total frame count calculation?",
        "answer": "The 'frames_per_second' input sets the frame rate per second, which is used to calculate the total number of frames based on the provided time duration. This parameter is crucial for determining the smoothness and quality of the animation or video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Frame Count Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Frame Count Calculator node is INT, representing the total number of frames calculated based on the input time duration and frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Frame Count Calculator node belong?",
        "answer": "The Frame Count Calculator node belongs to the Animation category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'seconds' input in the Frame Count Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'seconds' input in the Frame Count Calculator node is 10."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Frame Count Calculator node calculate the total number of frames?",
        "answer": "The Frame Count Calculator node calculates the total number of frames by first converting the input time duration (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) into total seconds. Then, it multiplies the total seconds by the frames_per_second input to obtain the total frame count."
