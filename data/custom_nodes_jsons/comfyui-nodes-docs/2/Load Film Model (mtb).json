        "question": "What is the purpose of the MTB_LoadFilmModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MTB_LoadFilmModel node in ComfyUI is designed to load the FILM model for frame interpolation tasks. It supports various model formats and ensures that the model is properly loaded for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the MTB_LoadFilmModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MTB_LoadFilmModel node is 'film_model', which specifies the FILM model to be loaded, affecting which specific model file is accessed and used for the frame interpolation task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MTB_LoadFilmModel node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MTB_LoadFilmModel node is 'film_model', which returns the loaded FILM model instance that can be directly used for frame interpolation operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MTB_LoadFilmModel node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MTB_LoadFilmModel node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the MTB_LoadFilmModel node?",
        "answer": "The category of the MTB_LoadFilmModel node is 'mtb/frame iterpolation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'load_model' function in the MTB_LoadFilmModel node do?",
        "answer": "The 'load_model' function in the MTB_LoadFilmModel node loads the specified FILM model and returns an instance of the interpolator.Interpolator class, which can be used for frame interpolation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified FILM model path does not exist?",
        "answer": "If the specified FILM model path does not exist, the MTB_LoadFilmModel node will raise a ValueError with a message indicating that the model does not exist."
