        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskListComposite node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskListComposite node in ComfyUI is designed to perform specified logical or arithmetic operations on a series of binary masks. It processes input masks sequentially, applying the selected operation to combine them into a single resulting mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskListComposite node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MaskListComposite node are 'mask' and 'operation'. The 'mask' parameter is a collection of binary masks to be combined, and the 'operation' parameter specifies the type of operation to be performed on the input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'operation' parameter in the MaskListComposite node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'operation' parameter in the MaskListComposite node are 'multiply', 'add', 'and', 'or', and 'xor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MaskListComposite node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MaskListComposite node is 'result', which represents the combined mask after applying the specified operation on the input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskListComposite node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskListComposite node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the MaskListComposite node belong?",
        "answer": "The MaskListComposite node belongs to the 'face_parsing' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'main' function in the MaskListComposite node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'main' function in the MaskListComposite node is a tuple containing a torch.Tensor representing the combined mask."
