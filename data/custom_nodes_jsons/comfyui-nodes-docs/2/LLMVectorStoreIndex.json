        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMVectorStoreIndex node in ComfyUI is designed to create an index from a collection of documents using a language model, generating embedding vectors. This process includes tokenizing the documents, optionally applying metadata, and utilizing the embedding capabilities of the language model to enable efficient retrieval and similarity search between documents."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node are 'llm_model', which specifies the language model used to generate embedding vectors, and 'document', which is the collection of documents to be indexed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is 'optional_llm_context', which provides optional context to the language model, allowing customization of the embedding process according to specific needs or scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is 'llm_index', which is the index created from the documents, structured for efficient retrieval and similarity search."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the ' splitter' in the source code of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node, the 'splitter' is used to split the text of the documents into chunks of a specified size with a specified overlap."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'tokenizer' in the source code of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node, the 'tokenizer' is used to count and truncate the metadata of the documents to ensure it does not exceed a specified maximum token count."
