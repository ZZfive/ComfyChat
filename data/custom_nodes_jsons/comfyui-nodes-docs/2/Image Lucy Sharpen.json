        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node is to enhance the clarity and detail of images by applying a sharpening filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' parameter specify in the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter specifies the input images that need to be sharpened, which is crucial for the node's operation and directly affects the quality of the sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'iterations' parameter influence the sharpening process in the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter determines the number of times the sharpening process is applied to each image channel. More iterations can lead to a more pronounced sharpening effect but also increase computational load."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'kernel_size' parameter in the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_size' parameter defines the size of the convolution kernel used in the sharpening process. A larger kernel size can capture more context but may also introduce more blur, affecting the balance between sharpness and smoothness in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sharpened_images' output parameter represent in the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpened_images' output parameter contains the image results after applying the sharpening process, expected to have better clarity and detail compared to the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the lucy_sharpen function in the WAS_Lucy_Sharpen node work?",
        "answer": "The lucy_sharpen function applies an iterative process to refine the image, making edges and details more pronounced without introducing significant artifacts, thereby enhancing the visual quality of potentially blurred or softened images."
