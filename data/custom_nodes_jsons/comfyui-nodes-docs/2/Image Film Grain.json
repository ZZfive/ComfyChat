        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Film_Grain node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Film_Grain node is designed to add a film grain effect to images, enhancing their visual texture and creating an aesthetic appeal similar to traditional film photography."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Film_Grain node include: image (the input image to which the film grain effect will be applied), density (which controls the concentration of noise applied to the image), intensity (which determines the strength of the film grain overlay), highlights (which adjusts the brightness of the image, particularly targeting brighter areas), and supersample_factor (which increases the resolution of the image before applying noise)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the density parameter control in the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The density parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node controls the concentration of noise applied to the image. It is essential for adjusting the intensity of the film grain effect, allowing for fine-tuning to suit different visual preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the intensity parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The intensity parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node determines the strength of the film grain overlay on the original image. It is a crucial factor in achieving a balanced effect, ensuring that the grain is noticeable but not overwhelming the details of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the highlights parameter influence the image in the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The highlights parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node adjusts the brightness of the image, specifically targeting the brighter areas. It plays an important role in enhancing contrast and making the film grain effect more pronounced in the brighter parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the supersample_factor parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The supersample_factor parameter in the WAS_Film_Grain node increases the resolution of the image before applying noise, which can result in a more detailed and higher quality film grain effect. It is an optional setting for users seeking greater control over the final output appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the film_grain_image output parameter represent in the WAS_Film_Grain node?",
        "answer": "The film_grain_image output parameter represents the final image with the film grain effect applied. It is the culmination of all node processing, reflecting the user's settings for density, intensity, and highlights."
