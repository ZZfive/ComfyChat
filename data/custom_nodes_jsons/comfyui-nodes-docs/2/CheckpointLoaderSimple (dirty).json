        "question": "What is the purpose of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node in ComfyUI simplifies the model checkpoint loading process in a less conventional or 'dirty' way. It automates the process of finding and using the appropriate checkpoint files based on a given name, providing a simpler and faster model initialization for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is 'ckpt_name', which specifies the name of the checkpoint file to be loaded. This node automates the process of finding the matching filename, making it easier to load models without specifying the exact file path."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node are 'model', 'clip', and 'vae'. The 'model' output represents the loaded model from the specified checkpoint, the 'clip' output provides the associated CLIP model (if available and requested), and the 'vae' output provides the associated VAE model (if available and requested)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The category of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is 'Bmad/api/dirty loaders'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is not an output node. It is specified as 'False' in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node show?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node shows the implementation of the class, including its input and output types, function, category, and the load_checkpoint method, which uses the DirtyLoaderUtils to find the matching filename and loads the checkpoint using the CheckpointLoaderSimple node."
