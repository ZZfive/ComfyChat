        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Flip class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Flip class in ComfyUI is designed to perform image flipping transformations on a set of images, either horizontally or vertically. This operation is crucial for data augmentation in machine learning tasks, providing diversity in training data to improve the model's robustness and generalization ability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Flip node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Flip node are 'images', which is the collection of images to be flipped, and 'mode', which determines the direction of the flip (either 'horizontal' or 'vertical')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'images' input parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'images' input parameter is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'mode' input parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'mode' input parameter is COMBO, with options 'horizontal' and 'vertical'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Image_Flip node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Image_Flip node is 'images', which represents the transformed images after the flipping operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output 'images' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the output 'images' is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the WAS_Image_Flip node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the WAS_Image_Flip node is CPU."
