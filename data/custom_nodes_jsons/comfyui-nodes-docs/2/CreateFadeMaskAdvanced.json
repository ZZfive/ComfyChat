        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node is used to generate advanced fade-in and fade-out masks with customizable parameters, allowing fine control over the progression, intensity, and spatial distribution of the fade effects in image sequences or animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node are: points_string (STRING), invert (BOOLEAN), frames (INT), width (INT), height (INT), and interpolation (COMBO[STRING])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the points_string input define in the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The points_string input defines a string of points containing specific frame points and their corresponding mask values, which are used to generate the fade-in and fade-out effects in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the invert input in the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The invert input is a boolean flag that allows the mask values to be inverted, enabling the creation of reverse fade-in and fade-out effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the interpolation input in the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node determine?",
        "answer": "The interpolation input determines the method of interpolation between frames for the mask values, affecting the smoothness and style of the fade-in and fade-out effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node is MASK, which represents a batch of generated masks suitable for creating fade-in and fade-out effects in image sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available interpolation methods in the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The available interpolation methods in the CreateFadeMaskAdvanced node are: linear, ease_in, ease_out, and ease_in_out."
