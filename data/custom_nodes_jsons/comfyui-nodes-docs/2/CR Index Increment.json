        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_IncrementIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_IncrementIndex node is designed to perform a simple but crucial operation in data processing and iteration tasks. It takes an initial index and an interval value, then increments the index by the specified interval. This functionality is essential for navigating through positions in lists, arrays, or any sequential data structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'index' parameter in the CR_IncrementIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is the starting point for the increment operation. It is crucial because it determines where the increment begins. This parameter is vital to ensure the correct sequence order and indexing in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interval' parameter define in the CR_IncrementIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'interval' parameter defines the size of the step by which the index will be incremented. It is important because it determines the spacing between the incremental values, influencing how the numerical sequence is generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' output in the CR_IncrementIndex node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'index' output reflects the new position after incrementing the original index by the interval. It is crucial for maintaining the correct progression through a data sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_IncrementIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, offering users a direct reference for more detailed information and guidance on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_IncrementIndex node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_IncrementIndex node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can users find more information about the CR_IncrementIndex node?",
        "answer": "Users can find more information about the CR_IncrementIndex node by visiting the provided URL in the 'show_help' output, which leads to the node's documentation on GitHub."
