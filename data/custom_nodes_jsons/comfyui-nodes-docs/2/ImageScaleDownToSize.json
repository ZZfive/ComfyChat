        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleDownToSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDownToSize node is designed to scale down images to a specific size while maintaining their aspect ratio. It provides modes for scaling based on either the maximum or minimum dimension, ensuring flexibility when reducing image sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScaleDownToSize node are 'images', which represents the collection of images to be scaled down, 'size', which specifies the target size for the images, and 'mode', which determines whether scaling considers the maximum or minimum dimension of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter in the ImageScaleDownToSize node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter in the ImageScaleDownToSize node specifies the target size to which the images will be scaled down. It plays a key role in determining the new dimensions of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' parameter affect the scaling process in the ImageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the ImageScaleDownToSize node determines whether the scaling process considers the maximum or minimum dimension of the images. This choice influences how the aspect ratio is maintained during scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageScaleDownToSize node is a tensor of images that have been scaled down to the specified size while maintaining their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ImageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ImageScaleDownToSize node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageScaleDownToSize node differ from the UtilImageScaleDownBy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDownToSize node differs from the UtilImageScaleDownBy node in that it scales down images based on a specific target size rather than a scaling factor. It also provides a mode for scaling based on either the maximum or minimum dimension of the images."
