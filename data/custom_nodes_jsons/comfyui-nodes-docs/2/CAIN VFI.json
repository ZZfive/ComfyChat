        "question": "What is the purpose of the CAIN_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CAIN_VFI node is designed to perform frame interpolation on a series of images, enhancing the smoothness and continuity of transitions between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which architecture does the CAIN_VFI node utilize for generating intermediate frames?",
        "answer": "The CAIN_VFI node utilizes the CAIN architecture to generate intermediate frames that do not exist in the original sequence, creating a denser and more detailed motion representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' input parameter in the CAIN_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' input parameter is crucial for loading the pretrained model weights required for frame interpolation. It identifies the specific model to be used in the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter affect the output of the CAIN_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter determines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of input frames, directly influencing the density of the output frame sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter in the CAIN_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter determines the frequency of clearing the cache during processing to manage memory usage, impacting the node's performance and memory efficiency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CAIN_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CAIN_VFI node is the 'output_frames' parameter, which contains the interpolated frame sequence, including both the original and newly created intermediate frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for using the CAIN_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the CAIN_VFI node is GPU."
