    {
        "question": "What does the wavelength parameter control in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx7 node?",
        "answer": "The wavelength parameter in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx7 node determines the frequency of the sinusoidal curves, which affects the overall pattern of the generated sequence. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it controls the granularity and periodicity of the binary representation."

    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx7 node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromWavelengthx7 node is a collection of seven sinusoidal curves, with each curve representing a unique phase in the binary sequence. These curves together provide a visual and numerical representation of the entangled zero-one pattern based on the input wavelength."
