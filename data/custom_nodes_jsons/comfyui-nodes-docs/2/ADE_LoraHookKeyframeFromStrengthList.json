        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node in ComfyUI is used to create a series of LoRA hook keyframes based on a strength list, allowing for dynamic adjustment of model behavior over multiple steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node are: strengths_float (FLOAT), start_percent (FLOAT), end_percent (FLOAT), and print_keyframes (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strengths_float' parameter define in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "The 'strengths_float' parameter in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node specifies the strength for each keyframe in the sequence. It can accept either a single float value or a list of float values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start_percent' and 'end_percent' parameters in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' and 'end_percent' parameters in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node define the start and end percentages for the keyframe sequence, setting the beginning and end points for the animation or transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_keyframes' parameter do in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "When the 'print_keyframes' parameter is enabled in the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node, it prints detailed information about each keyframe to the log, which is helpful for debugging and visualizing the keyframe sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node is 'prev_hook_kf' (LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES), which allows for seamless transitions between sequences by continuing from the previous LoRA hook keyframe sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoRA Hook Keyframes From List node is 'HOOK_KF' (LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES), which represents a group of LoRA hook keyframes to be applied to the model."
