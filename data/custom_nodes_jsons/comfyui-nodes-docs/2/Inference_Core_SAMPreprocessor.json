        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to segment images using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture. It processes the input image using a pre-trained SAM model, adjusts the image resolution as needed, and returns the segmented output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be segmented. This is the main data that the SAM preprocessor operates on to determine the regions of interest in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is resolution, which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be scaled before segmentation. This affects the fineness and quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is an image, which is a segmented version of the input image, highlighting the different regions identified by the SAM model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/others category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the execute function of the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node do?",
        "answer": "The execute function of the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node takes an input image and an optional resolution parameter, processes the image using a pre-trained SAM model, and returns the segmented output image."
