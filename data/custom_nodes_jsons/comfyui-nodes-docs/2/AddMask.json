        "question": "What is the purpose of the AddMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddMask node in ComfyUI is used to perform pixel-wise addition of two binary masks. It combines mask images while preserving the integrity of the original masks and creates a new mask representing their union."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The AddMask node requires two input masks: 'mask1' and 'mask2', both of which are of Comfy dtype 'MASK' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask1' input represent in the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask1' input in the AddMask node represents the first mask to be added. It is a crucial component as it helps form the resulting mask and determines the areas that will be included in the final combined mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask2' input represent in the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask2' input in the AddMask node represents the second mask to be added. Like the first mask, it plays an important role in defining the output mask by contributing areas to be included in the combined result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the AddMask node is a new binary mask obtained by adding the input masks. It represents the union of the two input masks, indicating the areas where the two masks overlap."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the output mask in the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The output mask in the AddMask node has a Comfy dtype of 'MASK' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The AddMask node uses the infra type 'CPU' for its operations."
