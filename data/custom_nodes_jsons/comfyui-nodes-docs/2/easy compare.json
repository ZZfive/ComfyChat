        "question": "What is the purpose of the Compare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Compare node in ComfyUI is used to evaluate logical comparisons between two inputs, providing a straightforward method to determine the relationship between values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the Compare node are 'a', 'b', and 'comparison'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the first operand in the comparison operation, setting the baseline value for comparison with the second operand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' parameter represent in the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter is the second operand used for comparison in the Compare node. Its importance lies in its contrast with the first operand, determining the result of the comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'comparison' parameter in the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The 'comparison' parameter defines the logical operation that determines how the two operands are compared, directly influencing the result of the comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Compare node is 'boolean', reflecting the binary result of the logical comparison between the two input operands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Compare node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Compare node is CPU."
