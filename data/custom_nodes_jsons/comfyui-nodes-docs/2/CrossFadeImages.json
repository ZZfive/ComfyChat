        "question": "What is the purpose of the CrossFadeImages node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CrossFadeImages node aims to seamlessly blend two sets of images using crossfade technique. It applies a transition effect that smoothly interpolates between the starting and ending images to create visually appealing morphing sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CrossFadeImages node?",
        "answer": "The CrossFadeImages node requires two sets of images as inputs: images_1 (the first set of images that will gradually fade out during the transition) and images_2 (the second set of images that will gradually appear)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameter determines the rate of change between images in the CrossFadeImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' parameter determines the rate of change between images. It defines the type of easing function used for the crossfade effect, which can significantly influence the visual dynamics of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'transition_start_index' parameter affect the crossfade effect?",
        "answer": "The 'transition_start_index' parameter allows control over the starting point of the fade-in process within the image sequence. It specifies the index at which the crossfade transition begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_level' parameter represent in the CrossFadeImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_level' parameter represents the initial alpha level of the crossfade. It determines the initial opacity of images_2 relative to images_1. A value of 0.0 means images_1 will be completely opaque, while images_2 will be completely transparent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CrossFadeImages node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CrossFadeImages node is a sequence of images representing the crossfade transition. Each image in the sequence is a blend of the input images, with the blend determined by the specified alpha levels and easing function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CrossFadeImages node use?",
        "answer": "The CrossFadeImages node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
