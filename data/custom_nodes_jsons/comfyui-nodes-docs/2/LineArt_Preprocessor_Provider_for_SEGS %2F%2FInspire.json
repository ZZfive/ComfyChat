        "question": "What is the purpose of the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI abstractly represents the process of generating line art from input images by applying stylized transformations, with a focus on enhancing edges and contours to create a more artistic presentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input parameter for the LineArt_Preprocessor_Producer_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'coarse', which controls the level of detail in the generated line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does enabling the 'coarse' parameter do in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'coarse' parameter in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node results in a more detailed and sharper output of the generated line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does disabling the 'coarse' parameter do in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "Disabling the 'coarse' parameter in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node produces a representation with fewer details in the generated line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'SEGS_PREPROCESSOR', which is a processed line art image, refined and stylized based on the input parameters, ready for further segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the corresponding Python dtype for the 'SEGS_PREPROCESSOR' output type in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The corresponding Python dtype for the 'SEGS_PREPROCESSOR' output type in the LineArt_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'LineArtPreprocessor'."
