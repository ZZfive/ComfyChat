        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node allows users to crop an image based on specified inset values, which can be defined in pixels or percentages. It provides precise control over the cropping area, enabling users to adjust the visible portion of the image as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node are: image (the image to be cropped), measurement (specifying the unit of the inset values, either pixels or percentages), left (inset value from the left edge), right (inset value from the right edge), top (inset value from the top edge), and bottom (inset value from the bottom edge)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node handle inset values defined as percentages?",
        "answer": "When the measurement input is set to 'Percentage', the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node calculates the inset values by converting the percentages to pixel values based on the image's width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node do when all inset values are set to zero?",
        "answer": "When all inset values (left, right, top, and bottom) are set to zero, the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node returns the original image without applying any cropping."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node handle invalid cropping dimensions?",
        "answer": "If the inset values result in invalid cropping dimensions, such as the top exceeding the bottom or the left exceeding the right, the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node is an IMAGE, which represents the cropped image based on the specified inset values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Image Inset Crop (rgthree) node is CPU, indicating that it runs on the CPU."
