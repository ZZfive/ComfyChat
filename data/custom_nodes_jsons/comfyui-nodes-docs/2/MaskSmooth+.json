        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskSmooth+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskSmooth+ node in ComfyUI is designed to apply Gaussian blur to a given mask, allowing the user to adjust the intensity of the blur. This process smooths the edges of the mask, creating a more visually appealing and smoother effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskSmooth+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MaskSmooth+ node are 'mask' and 'amount'. The 'mask' input represents the binary or grayscale image to which the Gaussian blur will be applied, and the 'amount' parameter controls the intensity of the Gaussian blur applied to the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MaskSmooth+ node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MaskSmooth+ node is 'mask', which is a modified version of the input mask with smoothed edges after applying Gaussian blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskSmooth+ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskSmooth+ node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'amount' input is an even number in the MaskSmooth+ node?",
        "answer": "If the 'amount' input is an even number in the MaskSmooth+ node, 1 is added to it to make it an odd number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'amount' input in the MaskSmooth+ node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'amount' input in the MaskSmooth+ node is 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MaskSmooth+ node return if the 'amount' input is 0?",
        "answer": "If the 'amount' input is 0, the MaskSmooth+ node returns the original input mask without applying any Gaussian blur."
