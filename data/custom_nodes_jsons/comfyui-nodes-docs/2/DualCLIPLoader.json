        "question": "What is the purpose of the DualCLIPLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DualCLIPLoader node is designed to efficiently load and manage dual CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) models, focusing on the seamless integration of two different CLIP models and facilitating their joint operation within a larger system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the DualCLIPLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the DualCLIPLoader node are 'clip_name1' and 'clip_name2', which specify the names of the two CLIP models to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'CLIP' output represent in the DualCLIPLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'CLIP' output represents the loaded CLIP model, which can be a combination of image and text embeddings. It is important because it enables further processing and analysis in the application, providing a basis for various downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the DualCLIPLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the DualCLIPLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DualCLIPLoader node load the CLIP models?",
        "answer": "The DualCLIPLoader node loads the CLIP models by using the 'load_clip' function, which takes the 'clip_name1' and 'clip_name2' parameters to determine the specific models to load and access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip_name1' parameter in the DualCLIPLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_name1' parameter specifies the first CLIP model to be loaded and plays a key role in determining the specific model to be used in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'clip_name2' parameter in the DualCLIPLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_name2' parameter specifies the second CLIP model to be loaded and is crucial for identifying and loading the required model, working effectively with the 'clip_name1' parameter to load the dual CLIP models."
