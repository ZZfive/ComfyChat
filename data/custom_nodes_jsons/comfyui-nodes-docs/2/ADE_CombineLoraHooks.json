        "question": "What is the purpose of the Combine LoRA Hooks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Combine LoRA Hooks node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple LoRA hook groups into a single unified LoRA hook group, enabling more complex and detailed model conditioning by combining the modifications or enhancements provided by each individual hook."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Combine LoRA Hooks node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Combine LoRA Hooks node are lora_hook_A and lora_hook_B, both of which are of the Comfy dtype LORA_HOOK and Python dtype LoraHookGroup."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does lora_hook_A represent in the Combine LoRA Hooks node?",
        "answer": "lora_hook_A represents the first LoRA hook group to be combined. It plays a key role in the aggregation process, contributing its modifications or enhancements to the final unified LoRA hook group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does lora_hook_B represent in the Combine LoRA Hooks node?",
        "answer": "lora_hook_B represents the second LoRA hook group to be combined. It contributes its unique modifications or enhancements to the unified LoRA hook group, enriching the overall conditioning effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Combine LoRA Hooks node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Combine LoRA Hooks node is a unified LoRA hook group (Comfy dtype: LORA_HOOK, Python dtype: LoraHookGroup) that combines the modifications or enhancements of the input LoRA hook groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Combine LoRA Hooks node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Combine LoRA Hooks node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the combine_lora_hooks method in the CombineLoraHooks class?",
        "answer": "The combine_lora_hooks method in the CombineLoraHooks class takes optional input LoRA hook groups (lora_hook_A and lora_hook_B), combines them using LoraHookGroup.combine_all_lora_hooks(), and returns a single unified LoRA hook group."
