        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMChat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMChat node in ComfyUI facilitates interactive dialogue with language models by processing user input and generating responses. It utilizes document embeddings, message templates, and a query engine to simulate a chat environment, enabling dynamic and context-aware conversations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LLMChat node are 'llm_model', which specifies the language model and its embedding model, and 'prompt', which is the user's input question or content that serves as the basis for generating a response."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types can be provided to the LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the LLMChat node include 'llm_context' for providing additional context to the language model, 'llm_message' for a list of chat messages to enhance the relevance of the generated response, and 'llm_documents' for optional documents to enrich the dialogue context or serve as reference material for the language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMChat node is 'response', which is the generated response from the language model to the user's prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for running the LLMChat node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for running the LLMChat node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMChat node handle the absence of provided documents?",
        "answer": "If no documents are provided to the LLMChat node, it spoofs a null document to allow interaction with the language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LLMChat node do when no prompt is provided?",
        "answer": "If no prompt is provided to the LLMChat node, it sets the prompt to 'null' to ensure the language model can still generate a response."
