        "question": "What is the purpose of the Draw Contour(s) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Draw Contour(s) node is designed to visualize contours by drawing them on the original image, allowing for customization of the visualization effects such as selecting specific contours to draw, adjusting the thickness of the contour lines, and choosing colors, thereby enhancing the interpretability of contour-based analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Draw Contour(s) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Draw Contour(s) node are: the original image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), contours to be drawn (Comfy dtype: CV_CONTOURS, Python dtype: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]), index_to_draw to specify which contour to draw (-1 for all contours), thickness of the contour lines (negative values indicate the contour should be filled), and the color of the contour lines (Comfy dtype: COLOR, Python dtype: Tuple[int, int, int])."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'index_to_draw' parameter work in the Draw Contour(s) node?",
        "answer": "The 'index_to_draw' parameter specifies which contour from the collection should be drawn. A value of -1 indicates that all contours should be drawn."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does a negative value for the 'thickness' parameter indicate in the Draw Contour(s) node?",
        "answer": "A negative value for the 'thickness' parameter indicates that the contour should be filled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Draw Contour(s) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Draw Contour(s) node is an image with the specified contours drawn on it, which enhances visual analysis of the contours (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Draw Contour(s) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Draw Contour(s) node is GPU."

    {
        "question": "In which category does the Draw Contour(s) node belong?",
        "answer": "The Draw Contour(s) node belongs to the Bmad/CV/Contour category."
