        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Integer node in ComfyUI is designed to convert floating-point numbers to integers by rounding down, providing support for operations that require integer values such as indexing or discrete mathematics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the 'Value' parameter in the DF_Integer node?",
        "answer": "The 'Value' parameter in the DF_Integer node accepts a floating-point number, which is then rounded down to the nearest integer for operations that require integers. The Comfy dtype for this input is FLOAT, and the Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Integer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Integer node is an integer, which represents the integer form of the input floating-point number obtained by rounding down to the nearest whole number. The Comfy dtype for this output is INT, and the Python dtype is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type does the DF_Integer node use?",
        "answer": "The DF_Integer node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the DF_Integer node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the DF_Integer node include CLIPTextEncodeSDXL, SVD_img2vid_Conditioning, Image Resize, and KSampler Adv. (Efficient)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DF_Integer node belong to?",
        "answer": "The DF_Integer node belongs to the Derfuu_Nodes/Variables category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Integer node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Integer node is not an output node."
