        "question": "What is the purpose of adding 3D nodes to ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Adding 3D nodes to ComfyUI allows for the creation of more complex and detailed images. These nodes can be used to generate different textures, shading, and lighting effects, enabling the creation of highly realistic 3D scenes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do custom nodes in ComfyUI contribute to its functionality?",
        "answer": "Custom nodes in ComfyUI extend its functionality by allowing users to create and add unique features or capabilities that are not available in the standard package. These nodes can be used to generate custom animations, effects, or other types of visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of using the ColorCNN extension with ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorCNN extension simplifies the color sampling step in ComfyUI, improving the user experience by reducing the time required to set up a scene. With ColorCNN, users can easily change the colors of their images without having to manually adjust each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI-Manager extension help in managing ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-Manager extension provides an intuitive interface for scheduling and managing ComfyUI workflows. It allows users to create, preview, and save animations, as well as set automatic runs and receive notifications when tasks are completed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main features of the Phong shader used in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Phong shader is a custom node in ComfyUI that provides three types of lighting effects: specular reflection, diffuse reflection, and ambient lighting. It allows users to create detailed and realistic 3D scenes by controlling these lighting properties."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI extension 'hidden' improve workflow?",
        "answer": "The 'hidden' extension in ComfyUI ensures that certain nodes are not shown by default in the interface, which helps in reducing visual clutter and making the workspace more organized. This can improve workflow by allowing users to focus on the nodes that are actually needed for their work."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is CGImage in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CGImage is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows users to apply high-quality color displacement techniques to an image. It uses a sample-based approach to generate displacements, enhancing the texture and shading in the final output."
