        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoRA Stacker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoRA Stacker node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate and configure LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) parameters into a structured format, facilitating the manipulation and application of LoRA adjustments across different model components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LoRA Stacker node include input_mode, lora_count, lora_name_i, lora_wt_i, model_str_i, and clip_str_i."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the input_mode parameter in the LoRA Stacker node specify?",
        "answer": "The input_mode parameter in the LoRA Stacker node specifies the input processing mode, which determines how LoRA parameters are aggregated and constructed, affecting the configuration and representation of LoRA parameters in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the lora_wt_i input in the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The lora_wt_i input in the LoRA Stacker node determines the weight of each LoRA parameter, influencing the extent of the adjustment's impact on the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input type does the LoRA Stacker node accept?",
        "answer": "The LoRA Stacker node accepts an optional input type called lora_stack, which is a pre-configured LoRA parameter stack that can be extended or modified with the current configuration, enhancing the flexibility of LoRA parameter management."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoRA Stacker node is LORA_STACK, which returns a structured representation of LoRA parameters that can be used for further processing or application in model components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the LoRA Stacker node include Efficient Loader, Eff. Loader SDXL, CR Apply LoRA Stack, and Reroute."
