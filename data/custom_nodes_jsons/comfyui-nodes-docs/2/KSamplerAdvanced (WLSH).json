        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node is designed to perform advanced sampling operations using a specified model in ComfyUI. It allows customization of the sampling process through parameters such as adding noise, random seeds, and sampling steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial for the operation of the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node as it defines the generative model used to generate samples. The choice of model significantly influences the quality and characteristics of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sampler_name' parameter affect the sampling process in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' parameter selects the specific sampling method to be used. Different sampling methods may result in different sample qualities and characteristics, making this parameter essential for achieving the desired outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'scheduler' parameter play in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' parameter defines the scheduling strategy that will be applied during the sampling process. It is important for controlling the speed of execution of the sampling steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'positive' and 'negative' parameters contribute to the sampling process in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' parameter provides conditioning information to guide the sampling process to generate samples with desired attributes, while the 'negative' parameter provides additional conditioning information to help avoid generating samples with undesirable features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'latent_image' parameter in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter is a key input to the sampling process, representing the initial latent state at which the sampling begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'add_noise' parameter influence the sampling process in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' parameter determines whether noise is added during the sampling process. It affects the diversity of the generated samples and is an important factor in controlling the trade-off between sample quality and noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'return_with_leftover_noise' parameter control in the WLSH_KSamplerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'return_with_leftover_noise' parameter controls whether the sampled image includes the leftover noise from the sampling process. It is useful for further processing or analysis."
