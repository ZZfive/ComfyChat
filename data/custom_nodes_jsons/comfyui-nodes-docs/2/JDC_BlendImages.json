        "question": "What is the purpose of the BlendImages class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BlendImages class in ComfyUI is used to seamlessly blend two images together by adjusting the transparency of one image and overlaying it on top of another, creating a composite image with smooth transitions between the original elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BlendImages class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BlendImages class are IMAGE_A (the base layer image), IMAGE_B (the image to be blended on top of IMAGE_A), and blend (a float value controlling the transparency level of IMAGE_B when overlayed on IMAGE_A)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blend parameter in the BlendImages class control?",
        "answer": "The blend parameter in the BlendImages class controls the transparency level of IMAGE_B when it is overlaid on top of IMAGE_A. It is crucial for balancing the two images and ensuring a natural and visually pleasing blend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BlendImages class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BlendImages class is IMAGE, which represents the final result of the blending process, combining the visual elements of the two input images into a single, coherent image."

        "question": "What infrastructure type does the BlendImages class use?",
        "answer": "The BlendImages class uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BlendImages class handle images with different dimensions?",
        "answer": "If the dimensions of IMAGE_A and IMAGE_B are different, the BlendImages class resizes IMAGE_B to match the dimensions of IMAGE_A using the Lanczos resampling method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the blend parameter in the BlendImages class?",
