        "question": "What is the purpose of the CCSR_Upscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CCSR_Upscale node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the resolution of an image or latent representation using advanced upscaling techniques. It employs custom algorithms and models to enlarge images, aiming to produce outputs with higher fidelity compared to traditional upscaling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CCSR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CCSR_Upscale node include the ccsr_model, image, resize_method, scale_by, steps, t_max, t_min, sampling_method, tile_size, tile_stride, vae_tile_size_encode, vae_tile_size_decode, color_fix_type, keep_model_loaded, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale_by' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_by' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node determines the scaling factor for the upscaling process, which affects the final size of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'color_fix_type' parameter affect the upscaling process in the CCSR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_fix_type' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node specifies the method used for color correction, which is crucial for maintaining the color accuracy of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CCSR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CCSR_Upscale node is an upscaled_image, which provides an enhanced image with higher resolution, quality, and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the CCSR_Upscale node is the random seed for the upscaling process, ensuring the reproducibility of the results."
