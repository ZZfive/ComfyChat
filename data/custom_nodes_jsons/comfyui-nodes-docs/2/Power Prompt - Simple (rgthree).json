        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node in ComfyUI simplifies the process of generating conditions and text outputs based on a given prompt. It can optionally integrate CLIP embeddings and allows the insertion of pre-saved prompts or embeddings, streamlining the creation of customized text inputs for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node is 'prompt', which is a string that serves as the main text input for generating conditions and text outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node include 'opt_clip' for an optional CLIP model input, 'insert_embedding' for inserting pre-saved embeddings by name, and 'insert_saved' for including pre-saved prompts by filename."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node produce?",
        "answer": "The 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node produces two output types: 'CONDITIONING', which is the generated conditioning output based on the prompt, optionally enhanced through a CLIP model, and 'TEXT', which is the raw or modified prompt text that can be used as input for subsequent operations or models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node use?",
        "answer": "The 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'insert_embedding' input in the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node?",
        "answer": "The 'insert_embedding' input in the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node allows the insertion of pre-saved embeddings by name, enabling the customization of the prompt with specific, predefined features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'insert_saved' input in the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node?",
        "answer": "The 'insert_saved' input in the 'Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)' node allows the inclusion of pre-saved prompts by filename, facilitating the reuse of previously crafted prompts in new generations."
