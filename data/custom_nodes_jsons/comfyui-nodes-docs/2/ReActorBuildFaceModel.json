        "question": "What is the purpose of the BuildFaceModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BuildFaceModel node in ComfyUI is designed to synthesize facial models from a set of input images, utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to detect, analyze, and fuse facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BuildFaceModel node are 'images', 'face_model_name', and 'compute_method'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' parameter represent in the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter is crucial for the facial model construction process. It serves as the main input, providing the visual data necessary for facial detection and feature extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'face_model_name' parameter in the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'face_model_name' parameter is essential for identifying and organizing the output facial model. It acts as the unique identifier for each model, facilitating subsequent retrieval and management of the synthesized facial data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'compute_method' parameter influence the output of the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'compute_method' parameter determines the technique used to fuse multiple facial features into a single composite model. It affects the final representation of the facial model, with different methods potentially leading to varying levels of detail and accuracy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the optional 'save_mode' parameter in the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'save_mode' parameter decides whether the synthesized facial model should be saved to the output directory. It allows users to control the node's output, determining whether to preserve the generated models for future use or simply discard them after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'face_model_name' represent in the BuildFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The output 'face_model_name' represents the unique identifier of the synthesized facial model. It is the key information that users use to reference and utilize the generated model in subsequent processes or applications."
