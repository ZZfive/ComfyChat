        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_RandomHexColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_RandomHexColor node is designed to generate random hexadecimal color codes, providing users with a set of unique and randomly generated colors for various graphic design or visual applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'seed' parameter important for the CR_RandomHexColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is crucial because it initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the colors generated are reproducible. This feature is particularly important for maintaining consistency across different runs or for debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'hex_color1' output of the CR_RandomHexColor node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'hex_color1' output provides the first randomly generated hexadecimal color code. It is important as it represents one of the diverse color options that the node can produce, suitable for direct use in applications related to colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'show_help' output assist users of the CR_RandomHexColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to a documentation page for further assistance. This is a useful resource for users who may need additional guidance or information about the node's functionalities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_RandomHexColor node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_RandomHexColor node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many unique hexadecimal color codes does the CR_RandomHexColor node generate?",
        "answer": "The CR_RandomHexColor node generates four unique hexadecimal color codes labeled as 'hex_color1', 'hex_color2', 'hex_color3', and 'hex_color4'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the CR_RandomHexColor node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CR_RandomHexColor node is a Python class definition that includes methods for generating random hexadecimal color codes and returning them along with a help URL. It also specifies input and output types for integration with ComfyUI."
