        "question": "What is the purpose of the Solarize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Solarize node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the colors of an image by inverting colors above a specific threshold, providing a solarized effect to enhance visibility and contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by the Solarize node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the Solarize node is the 'image' parameter, which is crucial as it determines the source material that will undergo color adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter in the Solarize node decide?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in the Solarize node acts as the decision boundary for the solarizing process, determining which color hues are inverted to enhance the image's contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Solarize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Solarize node is the 'solarized_image', which is the image that has undergone the solarizing process to increase its visual appeal and clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Solarize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Solarize node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Solarize node belong?",
        "answer": "The Solarize node belongs to the 'postprocessing/Color Adjustments' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the solarize_image function in the Solarize node do?",
        "answer": "The solarize_image function in the Solarize node inverts the colors above a specific threshold in the input image and clamps the values between 0 and 1 to produce the solarized image."
