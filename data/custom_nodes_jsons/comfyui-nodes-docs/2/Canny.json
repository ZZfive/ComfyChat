        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny node in ComfyUI is designed to detect edges in images using the Canny algorithm, a popular edge detection technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The Canny node requires three inputs: an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), a low_threshold (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float), and a high_threshold (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the low_threshold parameter control in the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The low_threshold parameter is crucial for the initial stage of edge detection, defining the lower limit for edge identification. It works together with the high_threshold to fine-tune the detection process and control the sensitivity of edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the high_threshold parameter control in the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The high_threshold is essential for refining the detected edges, setting the upper limit for edge acceptance. It helps control the number of false edges and ensures that only the most significant edges are retained in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Canny node is an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which is an edge version of the input image where the edges have been detected and highlighted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Canny node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the output image from the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The output image from the Canny node, which is an edge version of the input image, is important for further image analysis or as input for other processing nodes that require edge information."
