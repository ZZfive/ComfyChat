        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetClearSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetClearSEGS node in ComfyUI is designed to process a collection of SEG objects by creating new SEG instances with certain attributes set to None. It plays a key role in preprocessing or modifying segmentation data for further analysis or operations within the ImpactPack utility suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'segs' parameter in the ControlNetClearSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter is the collection of SEG objects that the ControlNetClearSEGS node will process. It is crucial for the node's operation as it defines the input data that will be converted into a new format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ControlNetClearSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ControlNetClearSEGS node is a list of modified SEG objects. Each SEG object in this list has specific attributes set to None, which may be important for certain types of subsequent processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ControlNetClearSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ControlNetClearSEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'doit' method in ControlNetClearSEGS node process the SEG objects?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method in the ControlNetClearSEGS node processes the SEG objects by creating a new SEG instance for each SEG object in the input 'segs' collection, with certain attributes set to None."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ControlNetClearSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ControlNetClearSEGS node is 'ImpactPack/Util'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ControlNetClearSEGS node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the ControlNetClearSEGS node is not an output node. It is an internal node used for processing SEG objects."
