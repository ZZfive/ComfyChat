        "question": "What is the purpose of the Humans4DLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Humans4DLoader node is designed to load and prepare 4D human models for subsequent processing or analysis in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Humans4DLoader node are 'detector' and 'fp16'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'detector' input specify in the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'detector' input in the Humans4DLoader node specifies the detector model used to identify human bodies in images, which may affect the accuracy and performance of human detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fp16' input indicate in the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'fp16' input in the Humans4DLoader node indicates whether to use half-precision floating-point format (FP16) for the model, which may improve performance on compatible hardware."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Humans4DLoader node is 'human4d_model', which is a structured object containing the loaded 4D human model, its configuration, and detector for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Humans4DLoader node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Humans4DLoader node do in its source code?",
        "answer": "In its source code, the Humans4DLoader node downloads the necessary models and configurations, sets up the model for execution, and ensures that the model can be used for tasks such as motion analysis or 3D reconstruction."
