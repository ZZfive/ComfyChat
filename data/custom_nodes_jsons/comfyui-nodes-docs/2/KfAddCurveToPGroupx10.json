        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node in ComfyUI integrates multiple curves into a single parameter group, simplifying the management and application of keyframed curves in projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node?",
        "answer": "The KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node requires two inputs: curve0 (the initial curve) and parameter_group (the container for the curves)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional curves can be added to the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node?",
        "answer": "The KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node allows for up to 9 optional curves (curve1 to curve9) to be added, increasing the complexity and versatility of the parameter group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node is a parameter_group, which represents a unified and structured dataset that can be utilized downstream in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node use?",
        "answer": "The KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no parameter_group is provided as input to the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node?",
        "answer": "If no parameter_group is provided as input, the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node creates a new parameter_group using the input curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node handle an existing parameter_group input?",
        "answer": "If an existing parameter_group is provided as input, the KfAddCurveToPGroupx10 node creates a deep copy of it and adds the input curves to the copied parameter_group."
