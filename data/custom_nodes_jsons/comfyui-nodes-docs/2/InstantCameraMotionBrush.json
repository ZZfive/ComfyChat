        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstantCameraMotionBrush class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantCameraMotionBrush class in ComfyUI is designed to simulate camera motion effects in a virtual environment by generating a motion brush that represents the camera's movement trajectory within a frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the InstantCameraMotionBrush class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the InstantCameraMotionBrush class are model_length, width, height, action, and speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the model_length parameter affect the camera motion sequence?",
        "answer": "The model_length parameter determines the duration of the camera motion sequence. It is crucial for defining the range of the motion brush effect and how it unfolds over time. Longer sequences allow for more complex motion paths, while shorter sequences result in quicker, more abrupt movements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the action parameter specify in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class?",
        "answer": "The action parameter in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class specifies the type of camera motion to be simulated. It influences the motion trajectory and how the motion brush will represent the camera movement, catering to different creative needs and narrative purposes in visual content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InstantCameraMotionBrush class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InstantCameraMotionBrush class is a tensor representing the calculated camera motion trajectory, encapsulating the essence of the camera movement for further processing and integration into visual works."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the action parameter in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the action parameter in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class are 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'zoomin', and 'zoomout'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the speed parameter affect the camera movement in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class?",
        "answer": "The speed parameter in the InstantCameraMotionBrush class adjusts the pace of the camera movement. It directly impacts the intensity and rhythm of the motion effect, allowing for nuanced control over the final visual outcome."
