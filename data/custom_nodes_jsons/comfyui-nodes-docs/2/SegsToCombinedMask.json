        "question": "What is the purpose of the SegsToCombinedMask node?",
        "answer": "The SegsToCombinedMask node is designed to merge multiple segmentations into a single, comprehensive mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' parameter represent in the SegsToCombinedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter represents the collection of segmentation objects that the node will process to create a combined mask. Each segmentation object should contain a crop mask and a crop area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SegsToCombinedMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SegsToCombinedMask node is a 3D binary tensor, representing the combined mask formed from the input segmentations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the output mask in the SegsToCombinedMask node?",
        "answer": "The output mask is significant because it encapsulates the collective segmentations into a single, coherent structure that can be used for downstream tasks such as object detection or segmentation analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the SegsToCombinedMask node use?",
        "answer": "The SegsToCombinedMask node uses CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SegsToCombinedMask node's 'doit' function?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' function of the SegsToCombinedMask node returns a tuple containing a single element, which is the 3D binary tensor representing the combined mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' parameter's Comfy dtype 'COMBO[torch.Tensor]' indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'COMBO[torch.Tensor]' Comfy dtype for the 'segs' parameter indicates that it is a combination or collection of torch.Tensors, each representing a segmentation object."
