        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node in ComfyUI is used to obtain the width and height of an input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node requires an input image, specified by the 'image' parameter, which has the Comfy dtype of IMAGE and Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node outputs the width and height of the image as integers (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and the original size of the image as a list (Comfy dtype: BOX, Python dtype: list)."

        "question": "What is the category of the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node belongs to the 'ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerUtility' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the image size calculated in the source code of the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the GetImageSize node, the image size is calculated by converting the input tensor to a PIL image using 'tensor2pil' and then accessing the 'width' and 'height' attributes of the PIL image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the 'get_image_size' function in the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'get_image_size' function in the GetImageSize node returns a tuple containing the width, height, and original size (as a list) of the input image."
