        "question": "What is the purpose of the SplitLatents node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SplitLatents node is designed to split a given set of latent variables into two different groups according to a specified index, playing a key role in managing and organizing latent data for more refined control and operation of video-related latent information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SplitLatents node are 'latents', which is a dictionary containing 'samples' representing the latent variables to be split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'split_index' parameter define in the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'split_index' parameter defines the position where the latent variables will be split, determining the number of samples allocated to each group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SplitLatents node are 'LATENT_A' (the first group of latent variables after the split), 'A_count' (the number of latent variables in the first group), 'LATENT_B' (the second group of latent variables after the split), and 'B_count' (the number of latent variables in the second group)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'A_count' output in the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'A_count' output represents the number of latent variables in the first group after the split, providing a quantitative measure of the split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'B_count' output in the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'B_count' output represents the number of latent variables in the second group after the split, complementing 'A_count' to provide a complete measure of the split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for using the SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the SplitLatents node is CPU."
