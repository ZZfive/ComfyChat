        "question": "What is the purpose of the LogicNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LogicNode in ComfyUI is used to perform basic logical operations such as comparison operations (greater than, less than, equal to) and Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR). It abstractly supports the decision-making process by evaluating conditions and determining the result based on the specified logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LogicNode are 'Operation' which specifies the logical operation to be performed, and 'CompareValue_A' which is the main value used for comparison or logical operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the LogicNode are 'CompareValue_B' which is the secondary value used for comparison or logical operation along with CompareValue_A, 'OnTrue' which is the value returned if the logical operation results in true, and 'OnFalse' which is the value returned if the logical operation results in false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LogicNode is a wildcard type, meaning it can be any data type. The output is either the OnTrue or OnFalse value, depending on the result of the logical operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the LogicNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The category of the LogicNode is TREE_FUNCTIONS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the LogicNode to perform the logical operation?",
        "answer": "The function used by the LogicNode to perform the logical operation is 'do_logic'."
