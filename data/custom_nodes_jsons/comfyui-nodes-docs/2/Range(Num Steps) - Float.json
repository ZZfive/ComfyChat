    {
        "question": "What is the expected output when using the `build_range` function of the FloatNumStepsRangeNode?",
        "answer": "The `build_range` function is expected to return a tuple containing a list of float values and a list of integers representing the size of each range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the least number of steps one can specify for the `num_steps` input type in the FloatNumStepsRangeNode?",
        "answer": "The least number of steps one can specify for the `num_steps` input type in the FloatNumStepsRangeNode is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the meaning of the `range_sizes` output type in the FloatNumStepsRangeNode?",
        "answer": "The `range_sizes` output type in the FloatNumStepsRangeNode represents the number of digits generated for each range in the `range` output type."

        "question": "What is the difference between a variable type in ComfyUI and its corresponding Python dtype?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, a variable type affecting dtype is referred to as a `Comfy dtype`. In Python, this type is referred to as a `Python dtype`."

        "question": "Assuming a desired output list of `[10.0, 20.0]` from a `num_steps` of `2`, what minimum `start` value should one specify?",
        "answer": "To obtain a list of `[10.0, 20.0]` from a `num_steps` of `2`, the `start` value should be set to a minimum of `-9046`, as this is the minimum value that respects the constraint `-4096 < start < 4096`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one ensure that a floating-point range is evenly spaced using the ` FloatNumStepsRangeNode`?",
        "answer": "To ensure that a floating-point range is evenly spaced using the ` FloatNumStepsRangeNode`, maintain an equal increment or `step`, ensuring each step in the sequence is approximately the same, which can be calculated by dividing the difference between the `start` and `stop` values by the `num_steps` minus one."
