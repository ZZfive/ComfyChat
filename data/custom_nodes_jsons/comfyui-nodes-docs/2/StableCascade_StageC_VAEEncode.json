        "question": "What is the purpose of the StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node in ComfyUI is designed to encode images into latent representations using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It upsamples the input image to the desired resolution and then applies the VAE to generate a compressed latent space representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), 'vae' (Comfy dtype: VAE, Python dtype: torch.nn.Module), and 'compression' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'compression' parameter affect the encoding process in StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode?",
        "answer": "The 'compression' parameter determines the downsampling level of the image before encoding, which is a key factor in balancing the quality of the reconstructed image with the efficiency of the encoding process. It allows for fine-tuning the node's operation according to specific demands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode node are 'stage_c' (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'stage_b' (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'stage_c' output represent in StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode?",
        "answer": "The 'stage_c' output represents the compressed latent representation of the input image generated by the VAE. It is a crucial component in the cascade of image processing stages, serving as input for further refinement or analysis in subsequent stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'stage_b' output in StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode?",
        "answer": "The 'stage_b' output is a placeholder latent representation that complements the 'stage_c' output. It is initialized to zero and can be used in more complex image operation pipelines for extension or additional processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode is GPU."
