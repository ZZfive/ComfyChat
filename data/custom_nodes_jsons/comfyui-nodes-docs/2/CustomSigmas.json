        "question": "What is the purpose of the CustomSigmas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CustomSigmas node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a list of floating-point numbers into a sigma tensor, which can be easily manipulated and applied in noise-related operations within a neural network model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The CustomSigmas node requires two input parameters: sigmas_string, which is a comma-separated string of sigma values, and interpolate_to_steps, which specifies the number of steps to which the sigma values should be interpolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CustomSigmas node is a sigma tensor derived from the input list of floating-point numbers, which is essential for noise operations and applications in neural network models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CustomSigmas node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the loglinear_interp function do in the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The loglinear_interp function in the CustomSigmas node performs log-linear interpolation on a given array of decreasing numbers, which helps in adjusting the length of the sigma tensor to match the required number of steps in the model processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CustomSigmas node handle the case when the length of the sigma tensor does not match the interpolate_to_steps value?",
        "answer": "If the length of the sigma tensor does not match the interpolate_to_steps value, the CustomSigmas node uses the loglinear_interp function to interpolate the sigma tensor to the desired number of steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CustomSigmas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CustomSigmas node belongs to the KJNodes/noise category in ComfyUI."
