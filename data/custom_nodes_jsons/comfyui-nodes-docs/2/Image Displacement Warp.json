        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node in ComfyUI is designed to apply displacement warp effects to a given set of images. It uses displacement maps and an amplitude factor to determine the extent of the warp, resulting in visually distorted outputs that can be used for various creative and technical applications."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node are 'images' (the input images to which the displacement warp effect will be applied) and 'displacement_maps' (which indicate the direction and intensity of the deformation effect to be applied to the input images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node is 'amplitude', which controls the intensity of the displacement effect. The higher the value, the more noticeable the deformation; the lower the value, the more subtle the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node is 'images', which are the result of applying the displacement warp effect to the input images using the specified displacement maps and amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resize_and_crop' function do in the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node?",
        "answer": "The 'resize_and_crop' function in the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node resizes and crops the displacement map image to match the size of the target image, ensuring that the displacement map can be properly applied to the target image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'amplitude' parameter in the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'amplitude' parameter in the WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp node is 25.0."
