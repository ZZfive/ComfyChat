        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetHadamard (manual) node in ComfyUI applies a control network to a set of images, adjusting their conditioning based on provided conditions and specified strength, for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of using Hadamard product in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The Hadamard product is used in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node to modulate the influence of the control network on the images within the context of the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node are 'conds' (conditioning), 'control_net' (control network), 'strength' (float), and 'inputs_len' (int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter determines the intensity of the control network's influence on the images processed by the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter specify in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter specifies the number of images to be processed by the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node, allowing for dynamic adjustment based on the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node is 'conditioning', which represents the modified conditions after applying the control network to the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node is GPU."
