        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoRAScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoRAScheduler node in ComfyUI dynamically modifies the behavior of the model during inference according to predefined prompt schedules, improving the model's adaptability and controllability without changing the basic structure of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LoRAScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LoRAScheduler node are 'model' and 'text'. The 'model' parameter is the machine learning model that will have its behavior modified according to the prompt schedule, and the 'text' parameter contains the prompt schedule that specifies the modifications to be applied to the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter in the LoRAScheduler node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in the LoRAScheduler node represents the machine learning model that will have its behavior modified according to the prompt schedule. It is crucial as it defines the core of the node operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' parameter in the LoRAScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the LoRAScheduler node contains the prompt schedule that specifies the modifications to be applied to the model. It is essential for guiding the node to perform the required transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoRAScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoRAScheduler node is 'model'. It is a modified version of the input model with the prompt schedule applied, allowing for more fine-grained control and behavior during inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the LoRAScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the LoRAScheduler node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'apply' function in the LoRAScheduler node do?",
        "answer": "The 'apply' function in the LoRAScheduler node takes the 'model' and 'text' parameters as input, parses the prompt schedules from the text, and returns a modified version of the model with the prompt schedules applied."
