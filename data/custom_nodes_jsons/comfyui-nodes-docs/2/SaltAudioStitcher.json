    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioStitcher node are 'audio_a' and 'audio_b', which represent the first and second audio files to be stitched together, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the SaltAudioStitcher node is 'silent_transition_seconds', which specifies the duration of silence in seconds to be inserted between the two audio files, allowing for a smooth transition or pause between audio segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioStitcher node is 'stitched_audio', which represents the resulting audio file after stitching the input audio files together, possibly including a silent transition between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SaltAudioStitcher node use?",
