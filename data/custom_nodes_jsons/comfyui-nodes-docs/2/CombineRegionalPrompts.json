        "question": "What is the purpose of the CombineRegionalPrompts node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CombineRegionalPrompts node in ComfyUI is designed to merge multiple sets of regional prompts into a single, unified collection. It plays a key role in simplifying the regional data input process, ensuring that all relevant prompts are efficiently aggregated together without redundancy, thereby facilitating a more coherent and comprehensive analysis of regional information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the regional_prompts1 parameter in the CombineRegionalPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The regional_prompts1 parameter is crucial for the CombineRegionalPrompts node as it is the main input that contains the regional prompts to be merged. It is essential for the execution of the node because the quality and relevance of the aggregated prompts directly impact subsequent analysis and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is expected for the regional_prompts1 parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the regional_prompts1 parameter expects data of the REGIONAL_PROMPTS type, which corresponds to a List[str] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the combined_prompts output parameter represent in the CombineRegionalPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The combined_prompts output parameter represents the result of merging multiple regional prompts into a single, cohesive list. This output is important as it lays the foundation for further processing and analysis within the ImpactPack/Regional category, ensuring that the merged data is available for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected data type for the combined_prompts output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the combined_prompts output is expected to be of the REGIONAL_PROMPTS type, which corresponds to a List[str] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the CombineRegionalPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CombineRegionalPrompts node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CombineRegionalPrompts node merge regional prompts in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the CombineRegionalPrompts node, regional prompts are merged by iterating over the keyword arguments (kwargs) and concatenating their values to form a single list, which is then returned as the result."
