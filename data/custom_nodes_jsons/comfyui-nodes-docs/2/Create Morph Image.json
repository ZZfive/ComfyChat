        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node is designed to create a morph animation between two images in ComfyUI. It smoothly transitions from one image to another over a specified number of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node are image_a and image_b, which are the two images used for the morph animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'transition_frames' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The 'transition_frames' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node controls the number of frames used for the transition between the two images. More frames result in a smoother transition but a longer animation time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'still_image_delay_ms' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The 'still_image_delay_ms' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node sets the delay time in milliseconds for each static frame before the morph transition begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'loops' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node specifies the number of times the animation should loop. A value of 0 indicates that the animation will loop infinitely."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported file formats for the output animation in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node supports 'GIF' and 'APNG' file formats for the output animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node are image_a_pass (the first input image unchanged), image_b_pass (the second input image unchanged), filepath_text (the full path of the created GIF file), and filename_text (the filename of the created GIF)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'max_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'max_size' parameter in the WAS_Image_Morph_GIF node is 512 pixels."
