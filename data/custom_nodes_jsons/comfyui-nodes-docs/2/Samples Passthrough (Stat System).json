        "question": "What is the purpose of the `stat_system` method in the WAS_Samples_Passthrough_Stat_System class?",
        "answer": "The `stat_system` method in the WAS_Samples_Passthrough_Stat_System class is designed to provide a statistical overview of the current state of the system. It captures and records key system metrics such as RAM and VRAM usage, as well as hard disk space utilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'samples' parameter in the `stat_system` method?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is crucial for executing the `stat_system` method because it represents the potential space samples for system operations. These samples are used to evaluate the system's resource utilization, making this parameter an essential part of the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' output parameter represent in the `stat_system` method?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' output parameter represents the raw latent space samples that have been passed through the system. It serves as confirmation that the input has been processed by the system without any changes, ensuring the integrity of the data for further use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Samples_Passthrough_Stat_System class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Samples_Passthrough_Stat_System class uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `stat_system` method output the system statistics?",
        "answer": "The `stat_system` method outputs the system statistics by appending each statistic to a log string, which is then printed using the `cstr` function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the `get_system_stats` method provide?",
        "answer": "The `get_system_stats` method provides information on the used and total RAM, used and total VRAM, and used and total hard drive space in GB."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the `stat_system` method?",
        "answer": "The return type of the `stat_system` method is a tuple containing the 'samples' output parameter, which is of the 'LATENT' Comfy dtype and Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]] Python dtype."
