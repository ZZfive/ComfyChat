    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the XYtoPercent node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the XYtoPercent node are: background_image (the background image), layer_image (the layer image), x (the x-coordinate), and y (the y-coordinate)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the XYtoPercent node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the XYtoPercent node are x_percent (the x percentage coordinate) and y_percent (the y percentage coordinate), both of which are of the FLOAT data type in ComfyUI and float data type in Python."

    {
        "question": "How does the XYtoPercent node calculate the x_percent and y_percent values?",
        "answer": "The XYtoPercent node calculates the x_percent and y_percent values using the following formulas: x_percent = (x + _layer.width / 2) / _canvas.width * 100.0 and y_percent = (y + _layer.height / 2) / _canvas.height * 100.0, where _canvas is the background image and _layer is the layer image."
