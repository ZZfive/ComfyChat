        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'List of strings' node in Crystools?",
        "answer": "The 'List of strings' node in Crystools is designed to aggregate multiple string inputs into either a list or a single concatenated string, allowing easy handling and manipulation of string collections within the Crystools framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many string inputs can the 'List of strings' node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'List of strings' node can accept up to eight possible string inputs (string_1 to string_8)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'delimiter' input play in the 'List of strings' node?",
        "answer": "The 'delimiter' input is used to specify a separator string for joining the provided string inputs into a single concatenated string. Its presence determines whether the output format will be a list or a concatenated string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'List of strings' node?",
        "answer": "The 'List of strings' node has two output types: 'concatenated' and 'list_string'. 'concatenated' is a string resulting from joining the input strings using the specified delimiter. 'list_string' is a list containing the input strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'delimiter' input in the 'List of strings' node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'delimiter' input is a space character (' ')."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the 'List of strings' node require a GPU for execution?",
        "answer": "No, the 'List of strings' node runs on the CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'List of strings' node handle empty or None string inputs?",
        "answer": "The 'List of strings' node only appends non-empty and non-None string inputs to the output list or concatenated string."
