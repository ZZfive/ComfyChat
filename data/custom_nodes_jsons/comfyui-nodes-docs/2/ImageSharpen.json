        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sharpen node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sharpen node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the details of an image by applying a sharpening filter. It generates a sharpening mask using a Gaussian kernel to highlight edges and details in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Sharpen node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), sharpen_radius (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), sigma (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float), and alpha (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the sharpen_radius parameter affect the sharpening effect?",
        "answer": "The sharpen_radius parameter determines the range of the sharpening effect. A larger radius leads to a more pronounced sharpening effect, while a smaller radius provides a more subtle enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sigma parameter control in the Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The sigma parameter controls the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used for sharpening. It affects the smoothness of the sharpening transition and the diffusion of the kernel's influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the alpha parameter influence the sharpening intensity?",
        "answer": "The alpha parameter adjusts the strength of the sharpening effect. Higher values of alpha result in a more intense sharpening effect, while lower values produce a milder effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Sharpen node is sharpened_image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which is the result of applying the sharpening process to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the Sharpen node is CPU."
