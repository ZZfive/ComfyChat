        "question": "What is the purpose of the FindThreshold node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindThreshold node in ComfyUI is designed to identify the optimal threshold value for image segmentation or binarization based on specific conditions, improving the adaptability and precision of image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FindThreshold node are: src (source image), start_at (starting point of the threshold range), end_at (ending point of the threshold range), thresh_type (type of thresholding to apply), downscale_factor (downscaling factor for the image), and condition (condition to be met by the thresholded image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the downscale_factor input do in the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The downscale_factor input in the FindThreshold node determines the scaling down ratio of the image, which helps reduce computational load during the threshold search process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FindThreshold node is an image that represents the segmented or binarized version of the source image after applying the found optimal threshold value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the FindThreshold node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the FindThreshold node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindThreshold node belongs to the Bmad/CV/Thresholding category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FindThreshold node determine the optimal threshold value?",
        "answer": "The FindThreshold node determines the optimal threshold value by dynamically adjusting the threshold parameters within the specified range until the desired condition is met, using the provided condition input to evaluate and select the best threshold value."
