        "question": "What is the purpose of the PPFNPowerLawNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PPFNPowerLawNoise node is designed to generate various types of power law noise that can be applied in texture generation, random processes, and noise-based art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PPFNPowerLawNoise node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PPFNPowerLawNoise node include batch_size, width, height, noise_type, scale, alpha_exponent, and device."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the scale parameter affect the output of the PPFNPowerLawNoise node?",
        "answer": "The scale parameter adjusts the overall amplitude of the noise, controlling the visibility and intensity of the noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the alpha_exponent parameter in shaping the noise generated by PPFNPowerLawNoise?",
        "answer": "The alpha_exponent parameter shapes the power law distribution of the noise, influencing the frequency content and the 'color' of the noise (e.g., from white to brown noise)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the PPFNPowerLawNoise node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the PPFNPowerLawNoise node include resampling, modulator, seed, and optional_vae."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the modulator parameter do in the PPFNPowerLawNoise node?",
        "answer": "The modulator parameter adds modulation to the noise, creating more complex patterns and variations in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PPFNPowerLawNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PPFNPowerLawNoise node are latents, which contain the noise images in latent space representation, and previews, which provide a visual representation of the generated noise."
