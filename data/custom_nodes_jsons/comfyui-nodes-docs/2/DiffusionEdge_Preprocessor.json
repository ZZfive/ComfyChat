        "question": "What is the purpose of the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is designed to preprocess images using a diffusion-based edge detection model to extract edge maps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is the input image that needs to be processed for edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be specified for the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters for the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node include the environment context for the edge detection model ('indoor', 'urban', 'natural'), the patch batch size for processing image chunks, and the resolution to which the input image is resized before edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the environment parameter affect the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The environment parameter specifies the context for the edge detection model, influencing its behavior and output based on the selected environment ('indoor', 'urban', 'natural')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is an image representing the detected edges in the input image, suitable for further processing or visualization."
