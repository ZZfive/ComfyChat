        "question": "What is the purpose of the GreyScale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the GreyScale node is to convert the input color image into a grayscale image, enhancing the clarity of visual details by focusing on brightness changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the GreyScale node?",
        "answer": "The GreyScale node belongs to the 'image/postprocessing' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the IMAGE parameter required for the GreyScale node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the IMAGE parameter is required for the GreyScale node because it provides the raw input for the grayscale conversion process, influencing the overall operation of the node and determining the size and quality of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GreyScale node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GreyScale node is IMAGE, which represents the grayscale processed version of the input image, crucial for subsequent image analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the GreyScale node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type used by the GreyScale node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the GreyScale node?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the GreyScale node is 'process_image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the process_image function in the GreyScale node do?",
        "answer": "The process_image function in the GreyScale node takes the IMAGE input, converts it into a grayscale image using ImageOps.grayscale, creates a new RGB image, pastes the grayscale image onto it, and returns the RGB image."
