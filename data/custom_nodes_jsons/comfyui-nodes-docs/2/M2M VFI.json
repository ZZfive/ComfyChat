        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the M2M_VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The M2M_VFI node is designed to insert frames between two given video frames to enhance the smoothness and continuity of a video sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ckpt_name' parameter in the M2M_VFI node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter specifies the checkpoint name, which is crucial for determining the specific pretrained model used for frame interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the M2M_VFI node, what is the function of the 'frames' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter represents the input video frames that the node will process for interpolation. The quality and resolution of the input frames directly affect the output of the interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter play in the M2M_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' parameter determines the frequency at which the node clears the cache to manage memory usage, which is important for maintaining performance, especially when processing large amounts of video data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'multiplier' parameter affect the output of the M2M_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter influences the number of intermediate frames generated between input frames. A higher value results in more interpolated frames, which can achieve smoother transitions but may also increase computational demands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter serve in the M2M_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_interpolation_states' parameter provides a way to customize the interpolation process by specifying certain states or conditions, allowing for greater control over the output frames to meet specific project requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the M2M_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The output of the M2M_VFI node is represented by the 'output_frames' parameter, which includes both the original frames and the newly generated intermediate frames to provide a complete and enhanced video sequence."
