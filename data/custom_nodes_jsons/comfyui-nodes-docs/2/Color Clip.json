        "question": "What is the purpose of the Color Clip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color Clip node in ComfyUI is designed to modify colors in an image based on specific target and complement operations, possibly using additional color parameters for advanced adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Color Clip node are: image (the image to be processed), target (specifies the target of the color operation), complement (defines the operation complementary to the target), and color (the base color used for the image operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'target' parameter in the Color Clip node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'target' parameter in the Color Clip node specifies the target of the color operation, such as converting to black or white, or making no change. It defines the main operation performed on the image colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'color' parameter play in the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The 'color' parameter in the Color Clip node is the base color used for the image operation. It plays a key role in determining the result of the color clipping operation, as it sets the reference standard for color adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Color Clip node is an image, which is the resulting image after the color operation. It reflects the changes made based on the specified target, complement, and color parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Color Clip node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Color Clip node perform color clipping in the source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the Color Clip node performs color clipping by calling the clip() method with the image, color, target, and complement parameters, and then returns the processed image."
