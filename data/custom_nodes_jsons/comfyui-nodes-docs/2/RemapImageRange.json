        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapImageRange node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapImageRange node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the pixel value range of an input image to a specified new range and optionally clamp the resulting values to ensure they stay within specific limits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the RemapImageRange node are: the input image that needs to be remapped, the minimum and maximum values for the new range of the image pixel values, and a boolean flag indicating whether to clamp the remapped image values within the [0.0, 1.0] range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clamp' parameter do in the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'clamp' parameter in the RemapImageRange node is a boolean flag that indicates whether to limit the remapped image values within the [0.0, 1.0] range, ensuring they stay within the standard image value limits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapImageRange node is an image whose pixel values have been remapped to the specified new range, and possibly clamped within the [0.0, 1.0] range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the RemapImageRange node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'min' parameter in the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'min' parameter in the RemapImageRange node is 0.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'max' parameter in the RemapImageRange node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'max' parameter in the RemapImageRange node is 1.0."
