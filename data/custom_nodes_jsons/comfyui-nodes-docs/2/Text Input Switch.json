        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Input_Switch node is designed to conditionally select between two text inputs based on a boolean flag, guiding the flow of text data in a process or workflow that requires decision making."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Input_Switch node requires three inputs: 'text_a' and 'text_b' which are STRING types, and 'boolean' which is a BOOLEAN type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_a' parameter represent in the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_a' parameter represents the first text input that the node can switch to based on the boolean condition. It is crucial for the node's decision process as it represents one of the possible outcomes when the boolean flag is true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_b' parameter represent in the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_b' parameter represents the alternative text input that the node can choose when the boolean flag is false. It is essential as it defines an alternative path for the text data when the condition is not met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'boolean' parameter play in the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter serves as the flag that decides which text input to return. It is a critical component of the node's functionality as its truth value directly influences the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node is 'output_text', which is a STRING type. It represents the selected text after the node's decision process, either 'text_a' or 'text_b' based on the 'boolean' input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Text_Input_Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Input_Switch node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
