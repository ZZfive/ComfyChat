        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConditioningMultiCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple conditional inputs into a single unified conditional output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ConditioningMultiCombine node determine the number of conditional inputs to process and merge?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node determines the number of conditional inputs to process and merge through the 'inputcount' parameter, which specifies the number of conditional inputs to be combined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'conditioning_i' inputs in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning_i' inputs in the ConditioningMultiCombine node represent a series of conditional inputs to be combined, starting from 'conditioning_1' up to 'conditioning_{inputcount}'. Each input is incrementally added to facilitate the sequential combination process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'combined' output of the ConditioningMultiCombine node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'combined' output of the ConditioningMultiCombine node represents the result of combining the specified conditional inputs into a single conditional output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ConditioningMultiCombine node use?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum number of conditional inputs that can be combined using the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node allows a minimum of 2 conditional inputs to be combined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of conditional inputs that can be combined using the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node allows a maximum of 20 conditional inputs to be combined."
