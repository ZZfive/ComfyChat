    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'filename' parameter in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename' parameter is crucial as it defines the base name of the file where the prompt information will be saved. This is essential for identifying and organizing the saved data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'counter' parameter in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node assist in organizing saved files?",
        "answer": "The 'counter' parameter, an integer, helps distinguish between multiple saves or track the number of experiments conducted. It aids in the organization and indexing of the saved files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'path' parameter play in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node?",
        "answer": "The 'path' parameter specifies the directory where the file will be saved. It plays an important role in organizing the files within the filesystem and ensuring data is stored in the desired location."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_data' output type in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'text_data' output type represents the information compiled from the inputs, including positive and negative prompts, model names, and other metadata. It is the content that will be saved in a text file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'time_format' parameter in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node?",
        "answer": "The 'time_format' parameter determines the format of the timestamp in the filename. It is important for maintaining a consistent and readable structure of the saved files."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'info' parameter in the WLSH_Save_Prompt_File_Info node contribute to the saved data?",
        "answer": "The 'info' parameter contains additional metadata about the experiment, such as configuration settings and other details. It enriches the saved data with more context and aids in comprehensive analysis."
