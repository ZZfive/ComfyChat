        "question": "What is the purpose of the SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node is used for conditioning and generating video frames by processing and adjusting initial images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the essential inputs for the SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The essential inputs are clip_vision (for generating image embeddings), init_image (the starting image for video generation), and vae (the Variational Autoencoder used for encoding)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the input parameters width and height used in the SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The width and height parameters define the resolution of the output video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node output?",
        "answer": "The node outputs positive and negative conditioning samples, as well as an encoded latent representation of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SVD_img2vid_Conditioning node handle potential perturbations to the input images?",
        "answer": "It uses an augmentation_level parameter to potentially scale the pixels of the input image, introducing variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the default settings for motion_bucket_id, fps, and augmentation_level?",
        "answer": "The default settings are motion_bucket_id = 127, fps = 6, and augmentation_level = 0.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required for the video_frames parameter?",
        "answer": "video_frames requires an integer value."
