        "question": "What is the purpose of the BoolBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BoolBinaryOperation node is designed to perform binary operations on boolean values. It takes two boolean inputs and a string representing the operation to be performed, and returns the result of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BoolBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BoolBinaryOperation node are: 'op' (a string specifying the binary operation to be performed on the boolean inputs), 'a' (the first operand for the binary operation), and 'b' (the second operand for the binary operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BoolBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BoolBinaryOperation node is a single boolean value, representing the result of the boolean binary operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the BoolBinaryOperation node use?",
        "answer": "The BoolBinaryOperation node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what does the INPUT_TYPES function return?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the INPUT_TYPES function returns a mapping specifying the required input types: 'op' (a string), 'a' (a boolean), and 'b' (a boolean)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the BoolBinaryOperation node belong to?",
        "answer": "The BoolBinaryOperation node belongs to the 'math/bool' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the op function in the BoolBinaryOperation class do?",
        "answer": "The op function in the BoolBinaryOperation class performs the specified binary operation on the input boolean values 'a' and 'b' and returns a tuple containing the result of the operation."
