        "question": "What is the purpose of the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node in ComfyUI is designed to process and manipulate complex text inputs by replacing wildcards and Lora syntax with specific values or files, enhancing the flexibility and customization of text processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node are: model, clip, text, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input parameter represent in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input parameter represents the core model that the node will use for processing. It is crucial for the node's operation and directly impacts its ability to function properly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' input parameter in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input parameter is important for the randomization process of the node. It ensures that random elements in the text are generated in a reproducible manner, which is crucial for obtaining consistent results across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node are: model, clip, text, and unprocessed_text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' output represent in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' output represents the final processed text after all wildcards and Lora syntax have been replaced. It is the main output of the node and the result of the node's core functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unprocessed_text' output in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'unprocessed_text' output provides the original text input to the node without any modifications made by the node's operations. It serves as a reference for comparison or further analysis."
