        "question": "What is the purpose of the GligenClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GligenClamp node in ComfyUI is designed to pass GLIGEN data as-is, acting as a placeholder or checkpoint in the data processing pipeline. It ensures that the GLIGEN data remains intact as it goes through different stages of processing, serving as a control mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the GligenClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the GligenClamp node is the `gligen` parameter, which represents the GLIGEN data to be clamped. It acts as a transit station, ensuring that the GLIGEN data remains unchanged throughout the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data type does the `gligen` parameter in GligenClamp node accept?",
        "answer": "The `gligen` parameter in the GligenClamp node accepts the Comfy data type `GLIGEN`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the `gligen` parameter in GligenClamp node correspond to?",
        "answer": "The `gligen` parameter in the GligenClamp node corresponds to the Python data type `tuple`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GligenClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GligenClamp node is `gligen`, which returns the unmodified GLIGEN data, ensuring its integrity in the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What hardware type is associated with the GligenClamp node?",
        "answer": "The hardware type associated with the GligenClamp node is `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the GligenClamp node?",
        "answer": "The category of the GligenClamp node is `clamp`."
