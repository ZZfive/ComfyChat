        "question": "What is the category of the ImageFilterMode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImageFilterMode node is image/filter."

        "question": "Is the ImageFilterMode node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageFilterMode node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageFilterMode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageFilterMode node are 'images' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'size' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter determine in the ImageFilterMode node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter determines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel considered when calculating the mode, affecting the extent of filtering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageFilterMode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageFilterMode node is 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageFilterMode node do to the input image?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMode node applies a mode filter to the input image, replacing each pixel's value with the most frequent value in its specified size neighborhood, enhancing image uniformity or reducing noise."
