        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node is designed to process optical flow data by applying a mask to it. This preprocessing step is crucial for tasks that require focusing on analyzing specific regions of the optical flow, improving the accuracy and relevance of the optical flow data in subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node are 'optical_flow' and 'mask'. The 'optical_flow' parameter represents the optical flow data to be processed, while the 'mask' parameter is used to specify the region of interest in the optical flow data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'optical_flow' parameter represent in the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The 'optical_flow' parameter represents the optical flow data to be processed. It is essential for determining the motion between two images or frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is used to specify the region of interest in the optical flow data. It plays a key role in filtering and optimizing the flow data for target analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node are 'OPTICAL_FLOW' and 'PREVIEW_IMAGE'. The 'OPTICAL_FLOW' output is the modified optical flow data after applying the mask, while the 'PREVIEW_IMAGE' output provides a visual representation of the masked optical flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'OPTICAL_FLOW' output represent in the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The 'OPTICAL_FLOW' output represents the modified optical flow data after applying the mask, which can be used for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'PREVIEW_IMAGE' output provide in the Inference_Core_MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The 'PREVIEW_IMAGE' output provides a visual representation of the masked optical flow, giving a preview of how the mask affects the flow data."
