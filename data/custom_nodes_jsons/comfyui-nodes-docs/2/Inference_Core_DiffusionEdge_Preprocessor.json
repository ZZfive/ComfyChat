        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to pre-process images by applying a diffusion edge detection algorithm, enhancing edges in the image based on the specified environment and patch batch size. It is suitable for tasks that require detailed edge information, such as line extraction in ControlNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'image', which is the input image to be processed by the diffusion edge detection algorithm. The optional input types are 'environment', which specifies the environment setting for the edge detection model, 'patch_batch_size', which determines the number of image patches processed simultaneously, and 'resolution', which is the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is 'image', which is the processed image with enhanced edges that can be used for further processing or visualization."

    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'environment' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'environment' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node are 'indoor', 'urban', and 'natural'. The default value is 'indoor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'patch_batch_size' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'patch_batch_size' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is 4, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 16."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is 512."
