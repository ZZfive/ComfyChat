        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is designed to preprocess images for segmentation tasks by applying the Canny edge detection algorithm, which enhances the edges of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the low_threshold parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The low_threshold parameter is crucial for the Canny edge detection algorithm as it determines the lower limit for edge detection. It influences the algorithm's sensitivity to noise and the fineness of the detected edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the high_threshold parameter in the Canny edge detection process?",
        "answer": "The high_threshold parameter plays a key role in the Canny edge detection process by setting the upper limit for edge linking. It defines how strong the evidence for an edge must be to be considered significant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is SEGS_PREPROCESSOR, which is a preprocessed image with enhanced edges suitable for segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required to run the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node requires a CPU infrastructure type to run."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the low_threshold parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the low_threshold parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 0.4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the high_threshold parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the high_threshold parameter in the Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 0.8."
