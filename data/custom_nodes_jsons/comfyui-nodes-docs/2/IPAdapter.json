        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterSimple node is designed to seamlessly integrate image processing adapters into the model's workflow. It applies various transformations and weightings to the model based on the provided image and adapter configuration, enhancing the model's ability to generate or process images according to specific styles or prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IPAdapterSimple node are: model, ipadapter, image, weight, start_at, end_at, and weight_type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter represents the core structure that will be adapted or modified by the IPAdapterSimple node. It is an essential input that determines the node's subsequent processing and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'weight' parameter affect the image processing in the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter adjusts the influence of the image on the model's output. It is a floating-point value that can significantly alter the node's processing based on its magnitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'attn_mask' parameter in the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'attn_mask' parameter is used to specify which parts of the input the model should pay attention to during processing. It is particularly useful for focusing the model's attention on certain regions of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IPAdapterSimple node is 'model', which represents the adapted or modified version of the input model after applying the transformations of the IPAdapterSimple node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the IPAdapterSimple node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the IPAdapterSimple node is GPU."
