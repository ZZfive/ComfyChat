        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSegDetectorProvider node is designed to create a bounding box detector based on the CLIPSeg model. It processes input text and image data to generate bounding boxes around objects of interest within images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the text parameter in the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The text parameter is crucial for guiding the detection process by providing a text description of the objects to be detected. It plays a key role in the accuracy and relevance of the generated bounding boxes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blur parameter in the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node adjust?",
        "answer": "The blur parameter adjusts the amount of blur to be applied to the image, which may affect detection accuracy. It is an optional parameter that allows fine-tuning of the detection process based on the characteristics of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the threshold parameter influence object detection in the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The threshold parameter determines the cut-off point for object detection. It is an optional input that can be used to control the sensitivity of detection, affecting which objects are recognized as relevant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the dilation_factor parameter in the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The dilation_factor is used to expand the boundaries of detected objects. It is an optional parameter that can enhance the detection of larger or more dispersed objects in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CLIPSegDetectorProvider is a BBOX_DETECTOR object, which contains the logic for detecting and generating bounding boxes around objects in images based on the provided text prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node is GPU."
