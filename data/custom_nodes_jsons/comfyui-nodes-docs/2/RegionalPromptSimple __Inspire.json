        "question": "What is the purpose of the RegionalPromptSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalPromptSimple node is used to generate regional prompts based on the given basic pipeline configuration and mask, allowing for precise and targeted control over the content generation process in specific regions of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RegionalPromptSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RegionalPromptSimple node are basic_pipe, mask, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, wildcard_prompt, controlnet_in_pipe, and sigma_factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the basic_pipe input represent in the RegionalPromptSimple node?",
        "answer": "The basic_pipe input represents the base components of the generative model pipeline, including the model, clip, VAE, and positive and negative prompts. It defines the foundation for generating regional prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the mask input in the RegionalPromptSimple node?",
        "answer": "The mask input is a binary mask that specifies the region of interest in the image. It plays a key role in determining where the regional prompts are applied, enabling targeted prompt generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RegionalPromptSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RegionalPromptSimple node is regional_prompts, which are the generated regional prompts customized for the specified region of interest in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the RegionalPromptSimple node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the RegionalPromptSimple node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the RegionalPromptSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the RegionalPromptSimple node in ComfyUI is InspirePack/Regional."
