        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomGeneratorForList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a series of random numbers based on a given seed, ensuring that the same seed will produce the same list of random numbers, which is crucial for reproducibility in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RandomGeneratorForList node are 'signal' which is of Comfy dtype ANY and Python dtype Any, representing the input data that triggers the random number generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' parameter do in the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the RandomGeneratorForList node is crucial for determining the starting point of the random number sequence. It ensures that the same seed will produce the same list of random numbers, which is vital for reproducibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unique_id' parameter in the RandomGeneratorForList node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter in the RandomGeneratorForList node is used to track and manage the random number generation count for each unique instance, ensuring that each instance has a different sequence of random numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the RandomGeneratorForList node produce?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node produces two output types: 'signal' which retains the original input signal indicating the completion of the random number generation process, and 'random_value' which represents the newly generated seed, a random integer that can be used for further random number generation or other purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the RandomGeneratorForList node use?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RandomGeneratorForList node generate a new random seed?",
        "answer": "The RandomGeneratorForList node generates a new random seed by using the 'random' module in Python. It creates a random number generator 'rn', seeds it with the sum of the current seed and count, and then generates a new seed using 'random.randint(0, 1125899906842624)'."
