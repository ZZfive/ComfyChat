        "question": "What is the purpose of the GlobalSeed node in the Inspire package?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSeed node is used to manage and manipulate the global seed value used by various nodes in the workflow. It allows setting the seed value, selecting the operation to modify the seed (such as incrementing, decrementing, randomizing), and controlling the application mode of the seed (before or after generation). This functionality is crucial for ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and variation in the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GlobalSeed node are: value (initial seed value), mode (determines whether the seed operation occurs before or after the generation process), action (defines the operation performed on the seed value), and last_seed (saves the last used seed value)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' input type specify in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input type specifies the initial seed value, which is crucial for initializing the seed operation process and affects the starting point of any seed-based operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input type determine in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input type determines whether the seed operation occurs before or after the generation process, affecting how and when the seed value influences the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'action' input type define in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'action' input type defines the operation performed on the seed value, such as fixing, incrementing, decrementing, or randomizing, determining how the seed changes over time or across nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'last_seed' input type in the GlobalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The 'last_seed' input type saves the last used seed value, allowing tracking and potentially reverting to a previous state."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the GlobalSeed node have any output types?",
        "answer": "No, the GlobalSeed node does not have any output types."
