        "question": "What is the purpose of the Blur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Blur node in ComfyUI is designed to apply Gaussian blur to images, enhancing their smoothness and reducing noise. It is particularly suitable for post-processing tasks when image clarity is not critical or a softening effect is desired."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Blur node is an image, which is the input image that the Blur node will process. It is the basis of the node's operation, and the quality and resolution of the image directly affect the appearance of the output after the blur effect is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blur_radius parameter control in the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The blur_radius parameter determines the extent of the blur effect applied to the image. Larger values result in more noticeable blur, while smaller values produce a more subtle effect. It plays a key role in controlling the visual outcome of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the sigma parameter affect the blur effect in the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The sigma parameter defines the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used for blurring. It controls the sharpness of the transition between blurred and non-blurred areas in the image. Higher sigma values lead to more extensive blurring, while lower values produce a more localized effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Blur node is the blurred_image, which is the result of applying Gaussian blur to the input image. It represents the main outcome of the Blur node and is crucial for subsequent image processing steps or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type for the Blur node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type for the Blur node is GPU, indicating that the node utilizes GPU acceleration for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the Blur node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Blur node defines the initialization, input types, return types, function name, category, and the blur method itself. The blur method takes the input image, blur_radius, and sigma as parameters and applies the Gaussian blur effect to the image using convolution with a Gaussian kernel."
