        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node is used to manually append camera control poses, allowing for customization and extension of camera movements in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node are poses_first and poses_last, both of which are of the Comfy dtype CAMERACTRL_POSES and Python dtype list[list[float]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the poses_first input represent in the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node?",
        "answer": "The poses_first input specifies the initial set of camera control poses to be appended. It plays a key role in determining the starting point of the camera movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the poses_last input define in the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node?",
        "answer": "The poses_last input defines the final set of camera control poses to be appended. It determines the endpoint of the camera movement, allowing for seamless transitions between camera states."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node is cameractrl_poses, which is of the Comfy dtype CAMERACTRL_POSES and Python dtype list[list[float]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node represents the combined camera control poses, integrating the initial and final poses seamlessly to achieve dynamic camera movement in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ADE_CameraManualPoseAppend node is CPU."
