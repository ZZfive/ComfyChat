        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberToInt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberToInt node is designed to convert numeric inputs into integer form, playing a crucial role in scenarios where the precision of floating-point numbers is not required and the simplicity and efficiency of integers are preferred."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'a' parameter in the NumberToInt node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter is the numeric input that the NumberToInt node will convert to an integer. It is essential to the operation of the node as it determines the starting point of the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'a' parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the 'a' parameter is Union[int, float], meaning it can accept either integers or floats as input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' output of the NumberToInt node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'op' output provides the integer conversion of the input parameter 'a'. It is important because it represents the final converted value that can be used for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'op' output in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the 'op' output is int, meaning it will always return an integer value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the NumberToInt node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the NumberToInt node is CPU, indicating that it runs on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the NumberToInt node?",
        "answer": "The category of the NumberToInt node is 'math/conversion', indicating that it performs mathematical conversions."
