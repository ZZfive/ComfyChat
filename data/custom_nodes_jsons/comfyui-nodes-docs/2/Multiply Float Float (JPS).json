        "question": "What is the purpose of the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Float Float (JPS) node performs multiplication of two floating point numbers and returns the result as both an integer and a floating point representation. It is designed to facilitate mathematical operations in broader computational workflows, highlighting flexibility in handling numerical data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node are float_a and float_b, both of which are floating point numbers that will be multiplied together."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype and Python dtype do the inputs float_a and float_b have?",
        "answer": "Both float_a and float_b have a Comfy dtype of FLOAT and a Python dtype of float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node produce?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Float Float (JPS) node produces two output types: int_multiply, which is the result of the multiplication converted to an integer, and float_multiply, which is the result of the multiplication as a floating point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node use?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Float Float (JPS) node uses the infra type CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Multiply Float Float (JPS) node classified?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Float Float (JPS) node is classified in the JPS Nodes/Math category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the get_multiply_float_float function in the source code do?",
        "answer": "The get_multiply_float_float function in the source code multiplies the two input floating point numbers float_a and float_b, and returns the result as both an integer and a floating point number."
