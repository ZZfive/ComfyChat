        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is used to identify and extract the ceiling regions from a given set of masks in ComfyUI. It processes each mask to highlight the ceiling areas, making it easier to analyze or modify these specific regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is 'masks', which are the input masks used for ceiling region identification. The comfy dtype for this input is MASK, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is MASKS, which are the processed masks with the ceiling regions identified and separated from the original input masks. The comfy dtype for this output is MASK, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenarios is the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is particularly useful when dealing with indoor scene images, as it helps isolate ceiling areas for further processing or applying special effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI is SALT/Masking/Filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node to process the masks?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node uses the 'ceiling_region' function to process the masks and identify the ceiling regions."
