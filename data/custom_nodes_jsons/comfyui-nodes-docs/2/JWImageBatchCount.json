        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageBatchCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageBatchCount node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the total number of images in a given batch of images. It provides a simple way to determine the size of an image batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the JWImageBatchCount node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the JWImageBatchCount node is 'images', which is a tensor containing a batch of images. This is the key input for determining the total number of images in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'images' input in the JWImageBatchCount node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'images' input in the JWImageBatchCount node is IMAGE."
