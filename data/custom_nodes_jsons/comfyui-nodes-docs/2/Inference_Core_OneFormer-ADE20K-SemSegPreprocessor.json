    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is an image that needs to be semantically segmented. The image is processed using the OneFormer model and segmented into different semantic categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the Inference_Core_OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the Inference_Core_OneFormer-ADE20K-SemSegPreprocessor node is the resolution, which specifies the resolution of the output image after segmentation. This affects the level of detail and dimensions of the segmentation output."
