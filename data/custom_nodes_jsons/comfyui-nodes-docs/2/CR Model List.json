        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ModelList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelList node is designed to manage and compile a list of models, each associated with a checkpoint file and an alias. It facilitates organizing and retrieving model checkpoints for further processing or animation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_ModelList node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_ModelList node are ckpt_name1 and alias1. ckpt_name1 is crucial for identifying the first checkpoint file associated with the model, while alias1 serves as the alternative name or identifier for the first checkpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the CR_ModelList node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the CR_ModelList node include ckpt_name2, alias2, and model_list. ckpt_name2 allows specifying a second checkpoint file, alias2 provides an alternative name for the second checkpoint, and model_list enables users to input a pre-existing model list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_ModelList node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelList node produces two output types: MODEL_LIST and show_text. MODEL_LIST represents the compiled list of models with their associated checkpoints and aliases, while show_text provides a textual representation of the model list for display or documentation purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_ModelList node enhance model management in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelList node enhances model management by allowing users to specify multiple checkpoints and their corresponding aliases. This key functionality improves the efficiency of the workflow by organizing and managing model checkpoints effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the model_list parameter in the CR_ModelList node?",
        "answer": "The model_list parameter is an optional input that allows users to input a pre-existing model list. It enhances the adaptability of the node by enabling the integration of external model lists into the node's operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_ModelList node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelList node uses the CPU infra type."
