        "question": "What is the purpose of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node in ComfyUI provides a mechanism to switch between two latent representations based on a boolean condition. It abstracts the decision process, allowing for dynamic selection of latent data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node requires three input types: 'on_true' (the latent representation to return if the boolean condition is true), 'on_false' (the latent representation to return if the boolean condition is false), and 'boolean' (the boolean condition that determines which latent representation to return)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node is 'latent', which represents the selected latent representation based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the CSwitchBooleanLatent node classified?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node is classified under the category 'crystools ðŸª›/Switch'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CSwitchBooleanLatent node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the CSwitchBooleanLatent node is not an output node. It is a utility node used for conditional selection of latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'boolean' input in the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' input in the CSwitchBooleanLatent node serves as the boolean condition that determines which latent representation ('on_true' or 'on_false') will be returned as the output."
