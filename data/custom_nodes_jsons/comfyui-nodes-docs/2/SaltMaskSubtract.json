        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskSubtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSubtract node in ComfyUI is specifically designed to perform subtraction operations between two sets of masks, effectively calculating the difference between them to highlight or remove specific regions within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSubtract node requires two input types: masks_a, which serves as the minuend, and masks_b, which acts as the subtrahend. Both inputs are crucial for determining the basis of the subtraction operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskSubtract node is MASKS, which represents the result of subtracting the second set of masks from the first set, generating a new set of masks that highlight the differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskSubtract node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskSubtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltMaskSubtract node in ComfyUI is SALT/Masking/Filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SaltMaskSubtract node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the SaltMaskSubtract node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the subtract_masks function in the SaltMaskSubtract node do?",
        "answer": "The subtract_masks function in the SaltMaskSubtract node takes two sets of masks (masks_a and masks_b) as input, performs a subtraction operation between them, clamps the result between 0 and 255, and returns the subtracted masks."
