        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeCheckpointLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCheckpointLoader node is designed to retrieve and load previously saved model checkpoints, allowing users to resume training or evaluate models from a specific point in time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'ckpt_name' input in the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' input is crucial for identifying the specific model state to be loaded. It directly affects the node's operation by determining which checkpoint to access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCheckpointLoader node outputs three types: MODEL, CLIP, and VAE. MODEL represents the state of the model at the time the checkpoint was saved, CLIP provides additional context and functionality to the loaded model if present, and VAE represents the variational autoencoder associated with the checkpoint if present."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SeargeCheckpointLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SeargeCheckpointLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SeargeCheckpointLoader node in ComfyUI is Searge/_deprecated_/Files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'load_checkpoint' function in the SeargeCheckpointLoader class?",
        "answer": "The 'load_checkpoint' function in the SeargeCheckpointLoader class returns the loaded checkpoint, which consists of the model state, CLIP, and VAE if present."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeCheckpointLoader node load checkpoints?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCheckpointLoader node loads checkpoints using the 'load_checkpoint' function, which takes the 'ckpt_name' as input and returns the loaded checkpoint."
