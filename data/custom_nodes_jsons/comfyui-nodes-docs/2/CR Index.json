        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_Index node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_Index node is designed to manage and retrieve specific indices from a given dataset, providing efficient indexing capabilities for large datasets to meet the needs of various data manipulation and analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'index' parameter in the CR_Index node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is crucial for specifying the location within the dataset from which the node will retrieve information. It directly affects the node's output by determining the exact data point that will be accessed, which is essential for data selection and filtering processes within the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'print_to_console' parameter in the CR_Index node assist users?",
        "answer": "The 'print_to_console' parameter allows users to toggle console output. When set to 'Yes', it enables the node to print the current index value to the console, providing real-time feedback during execution. This feature is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring the progress of data indexing operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INT' output in the CR_Index node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'INT' output provides the index value retrieved from the dataset, which can be further utilized in downstream processes. This output is important as it lays the foundation for subsequent data manipulation and analysis, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'show_help' output in the CR_Index node benefit users?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation, enabling users to access additional information and guidance on how to effectively use the node. This is especially beneficial for new users or when further clarification of the node's functionalities is needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_Index node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_Index node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'index' method in the CR_Index class?",
        "answer": "The 'index' method in the CR_Index class takes the 'index' and 'print_to_console' parameters to perform the indexing operation. If 'print_to_console' is set to 'Yes', it prints the current index value to the console. It returns a tuple containing the index value and a URL link to the node's documentation."
