        "question": "What is the purpose of the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node is an advanced sampler designed for efficient sampling in art creation. It adds a sharpness parameter to enhance the accuracy and detail of the sampling output, resulting in higher refinement in the generated artwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'sharpness' parameter in the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpness' parameter in the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node allows fine-tuning the sharpness level of the sampling output, enhancing the details and clarity in the generated artwork. It plays a key role in achieving the desired level of detail and texture in the artwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node include model, seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, positive, negative, latent_image, denoise, preview_method, and vae_decode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types are available for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node include optional_vae, script, and sharpness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input type specify in the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input type in the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node specifies the model used for sampling, which serves as the basis for generating art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node produce?",
        "answer": "The Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node produces the following output types: MODEL, CONDITIONING+, CONDITIONING-, LATENT, VAE, and IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ' Infra type: `CPU`' specification in the usage tips for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type: `CPU`' specification in the usage tips for the Fooocus_KSamplerEfficientAdvanced node indicates that the node is designed to run on CPU infrastructure."
