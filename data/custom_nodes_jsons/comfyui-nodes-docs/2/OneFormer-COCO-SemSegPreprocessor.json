        "question": "What is the purpose of the OneFormer COCO Segmentor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer COCO Segmentor node in ComfyUI uses a pretrained OneFormer model trained on the COCO dataset to perform semantic segmentation on images. It aims to identify and delineate each semantic object in the image, thereby enhancing the understanding of the image content at the pixel level."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image that needs to be semantically segmented. This parameter is crucial as it directly affects the segmentation output and determines the objects and their boundaries in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before segmentation. This parameter affects the level of detail in the segmentation output, with higher resolutions potentially leading to more accurate segmentation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'image', which represents the output of the semantic segmentation process in the form of an image where each pixel value corresponds to a semantic category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes used with the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node include the 'ImageToMask' node and the 'ControlNetApply' node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "From which file is the pretrained model loaded in the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "In the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node, the pretrained model is loaded from a file named '150_16_swin_l_oneformer_coco_100ep.pth'."
