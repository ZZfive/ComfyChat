        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Logical_OR node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_OR node is designed to perform a logical OR operation on two boolean inputs. It is fundamental in decision-making processes where the presence of either condition is sufficient to trigger an action or result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Logical_OR node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_OR node requires two boolean inputs: boolean_a and boolean_b. Both inputs are equally important in determining the function's result, as either one being true will result in an overall output of true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Logical_OR node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Logical_OR node is a single boolean value named 'result', which represents whether at least one of the input conditions has been met, encapsulating the essence of the OR logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Logical_OR node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Logical_OR node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the logical OR operation performed in the WAS_Logical_OR node's source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the WAS_Logical_OR node, the logical OR operation is performed using the 'or' operator between the two boolean inputs, boolean_a and boolean_b, and the result is returned as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the parent class of the WAS_Logical_OR node?",
        "answer": "The parent class of the WAS_Logical_OR node is WAS_Logical_Comparisons."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the reference repository for the WAS_Logical_OR node be found?",
        "answer": "The reference repository for the WAS_Logical_OR node can be found at https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui."
