        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConversableAgentCreator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConversableAgentCreator node is designed to create conversable agents that can engage in dialogues based on predefined system messages and optionally utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'name' parameter in the ConversableAgentCreator node?",
        "answer": "The 'name' parameter specifies the name of the conversable agent, serving as its unique identifier. This name is crucial for identifying and referencing specific agents within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'system_message' parameter influence the behavior of the conversable agent?",
        "answer": "The 'system_message' parameter defines the initial system message that sets the context or instructions for the conversable agent, guiding its interactive behavior. This message plays a key role in shaping the agent's personality and functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'llm_model' parameter in the ConversableAgentCreator node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'llm_model' parameter allows for the integration of a large language model (LLM) to enhance the conversable agent's dialogue capabilities by generating dynamic responses, thereby improving the quality of interactions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'agent' output represent in the ConversableAgentCreator node?",
        "answer": "The 'agent' output represents the created conversable agent, which is ready to interact, process user inputs, and provide responses. This output signifies a fully functional intelligent dialogue entity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the ConversableAgentCreator node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the ConversableAgentCreator node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what does the 'create_agent' function do?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'create_agent' function creates a conversable agent using the provided 'name', 'system_message', and optional 'llm_model' parameters. It returns the created agent as output."
