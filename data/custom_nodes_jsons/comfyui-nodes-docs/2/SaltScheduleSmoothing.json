        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSmoothing node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a smoothing filter to a schedule list, using a specified smoothing factor to blend consecutive values and create more gradual transitions between points in the schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltScheduleSmoothing node are 'schedule_list' (Comfy dtype: LIST, Python dtype: List[float]) and 'smoothing_factor' (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'smoothing_factor' affect the output of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The 'smoothing_factor' determines the degree of smoothness applied to the schedule list. A higher factor results in smoother transitions between points, directly affecting the smoothness of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node is 'schedule_list' (Comfy dtype: LIST, Python dtype: List[float]), which is a smoothed version of the input schedule list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltScheduleSmoothing node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltScheduleSmoothing node classified?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSmoothing node is classified in the 'SALT/Scheduling/Filter' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used in the source code of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The function used in the source code of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node is 'smooth'."
