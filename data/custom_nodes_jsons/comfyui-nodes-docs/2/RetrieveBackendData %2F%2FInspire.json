        "question": "What is the purpose of the RetrieveBackendData node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RetrieveBackendData node is designed to extract data from the back-end cache system, providing a streamlined method for accessing stored information based on a specified key."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'key' parameter in the RetrieveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific dataset to be retrieved from the back-end cache. It serves as a unique identifier, enabling the node to locate and return the correct information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is the 'key' parameter in the RetrieveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'key' parameter is of the STRING data type, while in Python, it is of the str data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'data' output represent in the RetrieveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' output represents the information retrieved from the back-end cache. It is a critical component of the node's functionality, as it passes the requested data to subsequent stages of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the 'data' output in the RetrieveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'data' output is of the COMBO[any_typ] data type, while in Python, it is of the Any data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the RetrieveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The RetrieveBackendData node requires a CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RetrieveBackendData node determine whether the retrieved data is a list or not?",
        "answer": "The RetrieveBackendData node uses a global cache variable to check if the retrieved data is a list. If it is a list, the node returns the data as is; otherwise, it returns the data wrapped in a list."
