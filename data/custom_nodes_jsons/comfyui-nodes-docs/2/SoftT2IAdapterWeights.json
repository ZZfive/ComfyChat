        "question": "What is the purpose of the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SoftT2IAdapterWeights node is designed to facilitate the adaptation of control network weights, allowing for the conversion of time keyframes into input adapter weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node are weight_00, weight_01, weight_02, and weight_03, which are all of the FLOAT Comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the weight_00 parameter do in the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "The weight_00 parameter is crucial for initializing the base level of control weights, influencing the overall effect of the time keyframe conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the flip_weights parameter in the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "When the flip_weights parameter is enabled, it reverses the effect of the control weights, providing an alternative perspective in the weight distribution and conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node are CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS and TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS output represent in the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "The CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS output represents the appropriately arranged and transformed control weights, ready to be applied to time keyframes for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the SoftT2IAdapterWeights node is CPU."
