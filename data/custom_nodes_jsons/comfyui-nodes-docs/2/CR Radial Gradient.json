        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_RadialGradient node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_RadialGradient node in ComfyUI is designed to generate radial gradient images, providing a seamless way to transition from a start color to an end color within specified width and height, with customizable radial center and gradient distance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_RadialGradient node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_RadialGradient node include width, height, start_color, and end_color. These parameters define the dimensions of the output image and the colors of the radial gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be adjusted in the CR_RadialGradient node?",
        "answer": "The CR_RadialGradient node allows for optional adjustments of radial_center_x, radial_center_y, gradient_distance, start_color_hex, and end_color_hex. These parameters enable fine-tuning the position, spread, and specific colors of the gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the gradient_distance parameter affect the output of CR_RadialGradient?",
        "answer": "The gradient_distance parameter in CR_RadialGradient controls the spread of the gradient, determining the speed of the color transition from the start color to the end color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_RadialGradient node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_RadialGradient node produces two output types: IMAGE, which provides the generated radial gradient image, and show_Help, which offers a link to the documentation for further guidance on using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the CR_RadialGradient node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CR_RadialGradient node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the radial gradient calculated in the CR_RadialGradient node?",
        "answer": "The radial gradient in the CR_RadialGradient node is calculated by determining the distance from each pixel to the radial center, interpolating the color at each pixel based on the start and end colors, and the gradient distance parameter."
