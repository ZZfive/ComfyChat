        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatSub node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatSub node in ComfyUI is designed to perform subtraction operations between two floating-point numbers, providing a simple and straightforward method for calculating numerical differences in computational graphs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatSub node requires two input types: 'a' (the minuend) and 'b' (the subtrahend), both of which are floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' input represent in the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "In the JWFloatSub node, the 'a' input represents the minuend, which is the number from which another number (the subtrahend) will be subtracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' input represent in the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "In the JWFloatSub node, the 'b' input represents the subtrahend, which is the number that will be subtracted from another number (the minuend)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWFloatSub node is a single floating-point number, which is the result of the subtraction operation between the two input floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the JWFloatSub node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWFloatSub node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWFloatSub node is not an output node."
