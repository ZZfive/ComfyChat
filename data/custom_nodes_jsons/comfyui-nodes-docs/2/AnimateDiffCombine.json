        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiffCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffCombine node in ComfyUI is designed to generate animated GIFs from a sequence of images. It processes the input images to create a coherent animation by adjusting the frame rate and loop count, allowing for customization of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'images' parameter in the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter is a sequence of image tensors that the AnimateDiffCombine node uses to generate the frames of the animated GIF. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly influences the content and quality of the output GIF."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_rate' parameter affect the animated GIF in the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_rate' parameter determines the speed at which the animation is played. It is an important factor in setting the pace of the GIF, influencing the transition speed between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'loop_count' parameter specify in the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'loop_count' parameter specifies the number of times the animation should loop. It is important in controlling the behavior of the GIF, especially when determining whether it should loop infinitely or have a set number of loops."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'save_image' parameter in the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'save_image' parameter indicates whether the generated GIF should be saved to the output directory. It plays a role in the functionality of the node, deciding whether the final product is to be saved for future use."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'filename_prefix' parameter contribute to the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter provides a prefix for the filename of the saved GIF. It is crucial for identifying and organizing the output files, ensuring they are easily distinguishable from other files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'pingpong' parameter in the AnimateDiffCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'pingpong' parameter, when set to True, creates a pingpong effect in the animation by reversing the order of the frames, adding a unique visual element to the GIF."
