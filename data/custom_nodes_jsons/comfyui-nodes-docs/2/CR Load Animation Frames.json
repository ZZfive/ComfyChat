        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_LoadAnimationFrames node is used to load and process image sequences from a specified directory, allowing manipulation and analysis of frame data in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the image_sequence_folder parameter in the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node?",
        "answer": "The image_sequence_folder parameter specifies the directory containing the image sequence to be loaded. It is essential for the node to locate and access the correct image sequence for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the start_index parameter affect the loading of image sequences in the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node?",
        "answer": "The start_index parameter determines the starting point of the image sequence to be loaded. It is important for controlling the starting frame of the sequence, allowing selective loading of frames within the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the max_frames parameter play in the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node?",
        "answer": "The max_frames parameter sets the maximum number of frames to be loaded from the image sequence. It plays a crucial role in limiting the amount of data processed, which is important for optimizing resource usage and workflow efficiency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the IMAGE output in the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node?",
        "answer": "The IMAGE output provides the loaded image sequence as a frame stack, allowing for downstream processing and analysis in the workflow. Its Comfy dtype is IMAGE, and the corresponding Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the show_help output in the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node provide?",
        "answer": "The show_help output provides a link to the documentation for further guidance on using the node and understanding its functionality. Its Comfy dtype is STRING, and the corresponding Python dtype is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the CR_LoadAnimationFrames node is CPU."
