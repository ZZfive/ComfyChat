        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Sequence Tweening node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Sequence Tweening node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance animation sequences by inserting additional frames between existing ones, effectively improving the smoothness and fluidity of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the multiplier parameter affect the tweening process in the Image Sequence Tweening node?",
        "answer": "The multiplier parameter determines the number of interpolated frames added between each original frame in the sequence, allowing control over the smoothness of the final animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Sequence Tweening node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Sequence Tweening node are the animation sequence to be processed (Comfy dtype: ANIMATION_SEQUENCE, Python dtype: AnimationSequence) and the multiplier (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Sequence Tweening node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Sequence Tweening node is the enhanced animation sequence with interpolated frames inserted between the original frames (Comfy dtype: ANIMATION_SEQUENCE, Python dtype: AnimationSequence)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Image Sequence Tweening node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the Image Sequence Tweening node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Image Sequence Tweening node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Image Sequence Tweening node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the _generate_extra_frames function do in the Image Sequence Tweening node?",
        "answer": "The _generate_extra_frames function generates additional interpolated frames between two input frames based on the multiplier value, either by duplicating frames in special cases or blending frames in normal cases."
