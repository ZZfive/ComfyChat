        "question": "What is the purpose of the RestoreFace node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RestoreFace node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance and repair facial features in images using advanced facial restoration models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the RestoreFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the facial restoration process as it provides the source material for face repair, directly influencing the quality and accuracy of the restored face."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'facedetection' parameter contribute to the RestoreFace node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'facedetection' parameter specifies the detection model used to identify faces in the input image, which is essential for accurate face localization and effective facial restoration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter in the RestoreFace node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter determines the facial restoration model to be applied, specifying the particular algorithms and techniques used to enhance facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'visibility' parameter affect the output of the RestoreFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'visibility' parameter adjusts the transparency level of the restored face, allowing fine-tuning of the degree to which original and restored features are blended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'codeformer_weight' parameter in the RestoreFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'codeformer_weight' parameter influences the contribution of the CodeFormer model in the restoration process, with higher values emphasizing the model's impact on the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the RestoreFace node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the RestoreFace node represents the final result of the facial restoration, where the faces in the input image have been enhanced and restored to higher quality."
