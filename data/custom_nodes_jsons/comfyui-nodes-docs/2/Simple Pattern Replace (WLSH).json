    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node are: input_string, list_string, pattern, and delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the seed parameter play in the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter initializes the random number generator during the replacement process, ensuring that the replacements are reproducible. It helps with the predictability and consistency of the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node is a string, which is a modified version of the input string with identified patterns replaced by elements from the list_string."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the delimiter parameter function in the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The delimiter parameter is used to split the list_string into separate elements, which can then be selected to replace identified patterns. It plays an important role in organizing the replacement options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the provided pattern is not found in the input_string?",
        "answer": "If the provided pattern is not found in the input_string, the node will return the original input_string without any modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WLSH_Simple_Pattern_Replace node is CPU."
