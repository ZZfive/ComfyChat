    {
        "question": "Under which category does the xy_Tiling_KSampler node belong?",
        "answer": "The xy_Tiling_KSampler node belongs to the Jags_vector/xy_tile_sampler category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the features of the xy_Tiling_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The xy_Tiling_KSampler node features model parameters that define the neural network architecture, a seed for initializing the random number generator, steps for controlling the number of iterations in the sampling process, cfg for adjusting model configurations, a sampler_name for selecting sampling methods, scheduler for controlling the sampling process, positive and negative conditioning parameters, latent_image for providing an initial latent representation, tileX and tileY for specifying tile application in the horizontal and vertical directions, and denoise for controlling the level of denoising."

    {
        "question": "What does the xy_Tiling_KSampler.node.sample function do?",
        "answer": "The xy_Tiling_KSampler.node.sample function applies asymmetric tiling to the model, hijacks the Conv2D methods, samples using the common KSampler, and then restores the Conv2D methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model is used by the xy_Tiling_KSampler node?",
        "answer": "The xy_Tiling_KSampler node uses a model that is crucial for the sampling process, defining the neural network architecture for generating images. The model is of type Comfy dtype: MODEL and Python dtype: torch.nn.Module, and it is the foundation of the node's functionality, determining the quality and characteristics of the generated images."

    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the xy_Tiling_KSampler.node.sample function?",
        "answer": "The xy_Tiling_KSampler.node.sample function accepts the following input types:\n- model: The model parameter (required)\n- seed: The seed parameter (required)\n- tileX: An integer specifying whether to apply a tile in the horizontal direction\n- tileY: An integer specifying whether to apply a tile in the vertical direction"
