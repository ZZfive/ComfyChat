        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentNormalizeShuffle node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentNormalizeShuffle node in ComfyUI is designed to normalize and randomly shuffle the latent representation of images, preparing them for subsequent processing or generation tasks. It adjusts the latent vectors to a standard distribution and rearranges them to introduce variability, thus optimizing the input for diverse image generation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents' input represent in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node represents the latent representation of the image that needs to be normalized and randomly shuffled. This process ensures that the data is standardized and randomized, which is crucial for achieving diverse and high-quality image generation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'flatten' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'flatten' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node specifies whether the latent representation should be flattened as part of the normalization process, which affects the data structure for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'normalize' input determine in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'normalize' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node determines whether the latent representation should be normalized, adjusting its scale and distribution to achieve consistent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'shuffle' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The 'shuffle' input in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node indicates whether the latent representation should be randomly shuffled, introducing randomness and variability to the dataset to enhance the diversity of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'latent' represent in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The output 'latent' in the LatentNormalizeShuffle node represents the normalized and randomly shuffled latent representation, which has been prepared for subsequent image generation tasks. This ensures that the input data is optimized to produce diverse and high-quality images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the LatentNormalizeShuffle node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the LatentNormalizeShuffle node is 'GPU'."
