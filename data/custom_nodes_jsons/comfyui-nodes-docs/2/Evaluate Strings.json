        "question": "What is the purpose of the Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically evaluate Python expressions that contain string variables. It allows for performing simple arithmetic or functional expressions by replacing variables in the expression with corresponding string values from other inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Evaluate Strings node are 'python_expression', which specifies the Python expression to be evaluated, and 'print_to_console', which controls whether the evaluation results and variable values are printed to the console."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' optional input represent in the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' optional input in the Evaluate Strings node represents the string value to replace variable 'a' in the Python expression. Changing this value alters the result of the expression."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'print_to_console' input affect the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_to_console' input in the Evaluate Strings node controls whether the evaluation results and variable values are printed to the console, which is crucial for debugging or visual confirmation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Evaluate Strings node is a string, which represents the result of the evaluated Python expression converted to a string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Evaluate Strings node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Evaluate Strings node handle the evaluation of the Python expression?",
        "answer": "The Evaluate Strings node handles the evaluation of the Python expression by defining variables 'a', 'b', 'c' and updating functions with 'len'. It then uses 'simpleeval.simple_eval()' to evaluate the expression with the defined variables and functions."
