        "question": "What is the purpose of the KSampler (Efficient) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KSampler (Efficient) node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently sample latent images using various sampling techniques, optimized for specific model configurations and condition parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KSampler (Efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KSampler (Efficient) node are: model, seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, positive, negative, latent_image, denoise, preview_method, and vae_decode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the KSampler (Efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the KSampler (Efficient) node are: optional_vae and script."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KSampler (Efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the KSampler (Efficient) node are: MODEL, CONDITIONING+, CONDITIONING-, LATENT, VAE, and IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type and common nodes associated with the KSampler (Efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KSampler (Efficient) node is GPU. Some common nodes associated with it are: KSampler (Efficient), PreviewImage, ImageUpscaleWithModel, VAEDecode, UltimateSDUpscale, CR Simple Meme Template, NNLatentUpscale, LatentUpscaleBy, ReActorFaceSwap, and VHS_VideoCombine."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KSampler (Efficient) node handle the case when no vae input is detected?",
        "answer": "If no vae input is detected, the KSampler (Efficient) node proceeds as if vae_decode was set to false."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the process_latent_image function in the KSampler (Efficient) node do?",
        "answer": "The process_latent_image function in the KSampler (Efficient) node performs the main sampling process using the Comfy KSampler nodes, based on the provided inputs like model, seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, positive, negative, latent_image, etc."
