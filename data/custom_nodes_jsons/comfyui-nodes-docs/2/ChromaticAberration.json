        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChromaticAberration node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChromaticAberration node in ComfyUI simulates the chromatic aberration effect on an image by shifting the color channels horizontally or vertically to create a realistic distortion effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ChromaticAberration node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ChromaticAberration node is the 'image' parameter, which serves as the basis for applying the chromatic aberration effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'red_shift' parameter in the ChromaticAberration node control?",
        "answer": "The 'red_shift' parameter in the ChromaticAberration node adjusts the horizontal or vertical position of the red color channel, contributing to the overall chromatic aberration effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'blue_direction' parameter affect the chromatic aberration effect?",
        "answer": "The 'blue_direction' parameter in the ChromaticAberration node specifies the direction in which the blue color channel is shifted, either horizontally or vertically, which is crucial for creating a convincing chromatic aberration effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ChromaticAberration node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ChromaticAberration node is the 'output' parameter, which represents the final image with the chromatic aberration effect applied, showcasing the visual impact of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the ChromaticAberration node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the ChromaticAberration node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'get_shift' function in the ChromaticAberration node's source code?",
        "answer": "The 'get_shift' function in the ChromaticAberration node's source code determines the shift values for each color channel based on the provided direction and shift amount, which is used to apply the chromatic aberration effect."
