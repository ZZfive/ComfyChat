        "question": "What is the purpose of the Smooth Event Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Smooth Event Curve node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a smoothly transitioning curve based on the frame counter, which helps create animations with smooth starts and ends."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Smooth Event Curve node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Smooth Event Curve node are: frame_counter, max_value, min_value, width_seconds, and center_seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frame_counter input determine in the Smooth Event Curve node?",
        "answer": "The frame_counter input determines the current time in seconds, which is crucial for calculating the position on the curve and influences the execution of the node by deciding the timing of the curve progression."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the width_seconds input affect the Smooth Event Curve?",
        "answer": "The width_seconds input decides the width of the curve in seconds, affecting the duration of the smooth transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the center_seconds input in the Smooth Event Curve node?",
        "answer": "The center_seconds input sets the center point of the curve in seconds, around which the smooth transition takes place."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Smooth Event Curve node provide?",
        "answer": "The Smooth Event Curve node provides two output types: FLOAT, which represents the floating-point result of the curve calculation, and INT, which is the integer representation of the curve calculated value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Smooth Event Curve node calculate the curve values?",
        "answer": "The Smooth Event Curve node calculates the curve values using the current time in seconds (x), start and end points, and applies a smoothing algorithm to ensure gradual transitions. The calculated value (y) is then adjusted based on the max_value and min_value inputs."
