        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryPatternSimple node in ComfyUI is used to parse binary patterns and render them as visual grids. It takes a string of binary digits and converts it into an image where each bit represents the color of a square in the grid, creating a visual representation of the binary data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node is 'binary_pattern', which is a string composed of binary digits (0s and 1s) that define the pattern to be drawn. Each row of bits corresponds to a row in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node are 'width' and 'height'. 'width' determines the width of the output image in pixels, and 'height' determines the height of the output image in pixels. Both should be positive integers and affect the size of the squares in the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node is an IMAGE, which is a visualization of the input binary pattern. It consists of a grid of squares, with each square corresponding to a bit in the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'show_help' output in the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node provides a URL link to the documentation for further information and assistance on using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryPatternSimple node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_BinaryPatternSimple node determine the size of the squares in the output image?",
        "answer": "The CR_BinaryPatternSimple node determines the size of the squares in the output image based on the 'width' and 'height' input parameters. The square width is calculated as 'width // len(rows[0])', and the square height is calculated as 'height // len(rows)', where 'rows' represents the number of rows in the binary pattern."
