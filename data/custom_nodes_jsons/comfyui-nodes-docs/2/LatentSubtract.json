        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The LatentSubtract node is designed to perform subtraction operations between two sets of latent samples. It takes two latent representations as input and outputs their difference, which is very useful for various applications such as feature extraction or anomaly detection within the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LatentSubtract node are samples1 and samples2, which are both of the 'LATENT' Comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the samples1 input in the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The samples1 input is crucial for the subtraction operation as it forms the basis of the operation. The quality of these samples directly affects the results of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the samples2 input in the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The samples2 input is the second set of latent samples that will be subtracted from the first set. The alignment and compatibility of these samples with the first set are crucial for the subtraction operation to be meaningful."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentSubtract node is samples_out, which is of the 'LATENT' Comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the LatentSubtract node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentSubtract node represents the difference between the two input sets of latent samples. This output can be used for further analysis or as input to subsequent nodes in a processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LatentSubtract node use?",
        "answer": "The LatentSubtract node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
