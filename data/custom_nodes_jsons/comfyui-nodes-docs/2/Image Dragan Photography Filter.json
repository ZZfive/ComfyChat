        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Dragon_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Dragon_Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a series of image processing techniques to simulate the appearance of a stylized dragon. It enhances the visual appeal of images by adjusting saturation, contrast, sharpness, and brightness, while also applying a high-pass filter to add texture details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the WAS_Dragon_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the WAS_Dragon_Filter node is an image. Optional input types include saturation, contrast, sharpness, brightness, highpass_radius, highpass_samples, highpass_strength, and colorize."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the saturation parameter affect the image in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The saturation parameter in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node controls the intensity of colors within the image. Higher values increase saturation, while lower values decrease it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the highpass_radius parameter control in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The highpass_radius parameter in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node determines the range of texture details preserved in the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the colorize parameter in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The colorize parameter in the WAS_Dragon_Filter node is a boolean flag that determines whether the final image should be colorized. When set to true, it applies a color blending effect to enhance visual appeal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Dragon_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Dragon_Filter node is an image, which is the result after applying the dragon filter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Dragon_Filter node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Dragon_Filter node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
