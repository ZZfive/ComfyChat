        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeOutput5 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput5 node in ComfyUI is used to categorize and separate input parameters into different outputs, which helps organize and flow data within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SeargeOutput5 node is 'parameters', which is a dictionary containing various settings that guide the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SeargeOutput5 node include 'parameters', 'base_conditioning_scale', 'refiner_conditioning_scale', 'style_prompt_power', and 'negative_style_power'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'base_conditioning_scale' output represent in the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_conditioning_scale' output in the SeargeOutput5 node represents the scaling factor for the base conditioning, which is crucial for adjusting the influence of the base input throughout the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'refiner_conditioning_scale' output in the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The 'refiner_conditioning_scale' output in the SeargeOutput5 node is the scaling factor for the refiner conditioning, which plays a key role in fine-tuning the output based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'style_prompt_power' output used in the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The 'style_prompt_power' output in the SeargeOutput5 node represents the power level of the style prompt, which is essential in determining the stylistic influence on the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'negative_style_power' output control in the SeargeOutput5 node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_style_power' output in the SeargeOutput5 node represents the negative power level of the style prompt, which is important for controlling unwanted stylistic elements in the output."
