        "question": "What is the purpose of the StyleModelLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StyleModelLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently manage and load style models. It is a crucial component in the model deployment pipeline, ensuring that the appropriate style model is retrieved and prepared for use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'style_model_name' parameter in the StyleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'style_model_name' parameter is crucial for identifying the specific style model to be loaded. It plays a key role in the node's execution by guiding the node to the correct file path in the style model directory. The value of this parameter directly influences the final model that is loaded and used in subsequent processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'STYLE_MODEL' represent in the StyleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output 'STYLE_MODEL' represents the loaded style model, which is a key element for further processing and analysis. It encapsulates the features and parameters learned by the style model, enabling it to be applied to various tasks such as style transfer or feature extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the StyleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the StyleModelLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StyleModelLoader node determine the file path for a given style model?",
        "answer": "The StyleModelLoader node determines the file path for a given style model by using the 'style_model_name' parameter to locate the correct file path in the style model directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'load_style_model' function in the StyleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'load_style_model' function in the StyleModelLoader node is a tuple containing the loaded style model, which is of type 'torch.nn.Module'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the StyleModelLoader node belong?",
        "answer": "The StyleModelLoader node belongs to the 'loaders' category."
