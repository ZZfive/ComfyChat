        "question": "What is the primary function of the SmoothMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the SmoothMask node is to process image masks to reduce noise and detail, providing a smoother visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SmoothMask node achieve the smoothing effect on masks?",
        "answer": "The SmoothMask node achieves the smoothing effect by applying a Gaussian blur to the input mask, effectively softening its edges and reducing high-frequency information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' parameter in the SmoothMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is the source image for the smoothing operation. It is crucial as it defines the initial state of the image that will be processed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'smoothness' parameter control in the SmoothMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'smoothness' parameter controls the degree of Gaussian blur applied to the mask. It is an important factor as it determines the extent of softening of the mask's edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SmoothMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SmoothMask node is a modified version of the input mask with reduced noise and smoother edges, which can be used in various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'smoothness' parameter in the SmoothMask node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'smoothness' parameter in the SmoothMask node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the SmoothMask node require a CPU or GPU for processing?",
        "answer": "The SmoothMask node requires a CPU for processing, as indicated by the 'Infra type: CPU' in the documentation."
