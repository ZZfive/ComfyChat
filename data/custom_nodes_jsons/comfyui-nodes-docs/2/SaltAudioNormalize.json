        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioNormalize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node is used to adjust the volume of a given audio file to a standard level, ensuring consistency in volume between different tracks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'audio' parameter in the SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' parameter is the raw audio data that needs to be volume normalized. It is crucial for determining the current volume level of the audio and adjusting it to the target normalization level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'audio' parameter in SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'audio' parameter in the SaltAudioNormalize node is AUDIO."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'audio' parameter in SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'audio' parameter in the SaltAudioNormalize node is bytes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltAudioNormalize node output?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node outputs the audio data that has undergone volume normalization, with the volume level adjusted to ensure consistency between different tracks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltAudioNormalize node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the SaltAudioNormalize node to normalize audio?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node uses the 'normalize_audio' function to normalize the audio."
