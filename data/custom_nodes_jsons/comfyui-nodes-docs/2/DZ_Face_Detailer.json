    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial for the FaceDetailer node as it determines the machine learning architecture used for facial detail enhancement. It is essential for the correct functioning of the node and for producing accurate facial feature enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'steps' parameter affect the FaceDetailer node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter influences the number of iterations the FaceDetailer node performs during the facial enhancement process. It affects the level of detail and refinement achieved in the final output, with more steps potentially leading to higher quality enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'positive' parameter play in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' parameter serves as guidance for the FaceDetailer node in determining which facial features to enhance. It plays a key role in shaping the final output, ensuring that the desired features are emphasized and improved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'latent_image' parameter in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter is crucial for the FaceDetailer node as it provides the initial data for facial feature enhancement. It serves as the foundation upon which the node builds and refines facial details, directly influencing the quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask_blur' parameter impact the FaceDetailer node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_blur' parameter is important for the FaceDetailer node as it determines the level of blur applied to the facial mask. It affects the smoothness and precision of the mask, which in turn influences the quality of the facial detail enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'vae' parameter in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter is crucial for the FaceDetailer node as it represents the variational autoencoder model used for decoding and generating facial images. It is a key component that enables the node to produce high-quality facial detail enhancements."
