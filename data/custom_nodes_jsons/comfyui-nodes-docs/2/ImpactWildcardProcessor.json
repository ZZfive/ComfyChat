        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactWildcardProcessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactWildcardProcessor node is designed to manage and process wildcards in text input. It facilitates the dynamic insertion or filling of wildcards based on a given pattern, enhancing the flexibility of text manipulation tasks. This node plays a key role in creating prompts that can adapt to various inputs by utilizing the concept of wildcards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node are 'wildcard_text' and 'populated_text'. 'wildcard_text' is crucial for defining placeholders in the text that can be dynamically filled, while 'populated_text' serves as the initial input text that may contain wildcards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter control in the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines whether wildcards should be populated or kept fixed. It controls the behavior of wildcard processing, allowing for dynamic content generation or the preservation of static text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' parameter in the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring reproducible results when processing wildcards. It plays an important role in maintaining consistency across multiple executions of the node, particularly useful for debugging and testing purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactWildcardProcessor node is 'processed_text', which represents the final text after all wildcards have been appropriately filled or kept intact according to the specified mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactWildcardProcessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImpactWildcardProcessor node in ComfyUI is 'ImpactPack/Prompt'."
