        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node in ComfyUI is designed to divide a single image into a specified number of smaller tiles. It intelligently manages the division to maintain the aspect ratio and ensure the tiles are evenly distributed across the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image' parameter in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is the main input to the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node, representing the image to be divided into tiles. It is crucial because the entire operation of the node revolves around processing this image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'num_tiles' parameter in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_tiles' parameter determines the total number of tiles the input image will be divided into. It is an optional parameter with a default value of 6, allowing users to specify the granularity of the tiling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'IMAGES' output parameter represent in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'IMAGES' output parameter represents the collection of tiles generated from the input image. Each tile is a part of the original image, and the arrangement of the collection reflects the structure defined by the 'num_tiles' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'num_tiles' parameter in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'num_tiles' parameter in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node is 6."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tile_image' method in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node do?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_image' method in the WAS_Image_Tile_Batch node divides a single image into a specified number of smaller tiles while maintaining the aspect ratio and ensuring even distribution of tiles across the image."
