        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChangeImageBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChangeImageBatchSize node is designed to adjust the batch size of image tensors to a specified size, either by expanding or cropping the batch as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of adjusting batch sizes for image data?",
        "answer": "Adjusting batch sizes is crucial for ensuring that image data is properly formatted for batch processing in various image processing and generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ChangeImageBatchSize node are the image tensor that needs to be resized and the target batch size which determines how the tensor will be resized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mode' parameter in the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter defines the resizing mode, currently supporting the 'simple' method for expanding or cropping tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ChangeImageBatchSize node is the image tensor with its batch size adjusted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for running the ChangeImageBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the ChangeImageBatchSize node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'simple' mode in the ChangeImageBatchSize node adjust the tensor batch size?",
        "answer": "In 'simple' mode, if the length of the input tensor is less than the batch size, it expands the last frame to match the batch size. If the length is greater, it crops the tensor to fit the batch size."
