        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberBinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberBinaryOperation node is designed to perform binary operations on numeric inputs in ComfyUI. It encapsulates various arithmetic operations that can be applied between two numbers, facilitating complex mathematical calculations within a simplified interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the NumberBinaryOperation node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the NumberBinaryOperation node specifies the specific binary operation to be executed. It is crucial as it determines the mathematical function the node will perform, thereby influencing the outcome of the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the NumberBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the NumberBinaryOperation node represents the first operand in the binary operation. It is essential as it constitutes half of the input required for the arithmetic calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' parameter represent in the NumberBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter in the NumberBinaryOperation node represents the second operand in the binary operation. It is crucial as it completes the set of inputs needed for the arithmetic process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'result' output in the NumberBinaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'result' output in the NumberBinaryOperation node is 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output in the NumberBinaryOperation node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the NumberBinaryOperation node provides the result of the binary operation performed on inputs 'a' and 'b'. It is significant as it represents the final computed value derived from the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the NumberBinaryOperation node use?",
        "answer": "The NumberBinaryOperation node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
