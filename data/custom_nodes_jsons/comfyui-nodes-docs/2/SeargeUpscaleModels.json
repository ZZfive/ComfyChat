        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeUpscaleModels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModels node in ComfyUI is responsible for coordinating the selection and configuration of image enhancement upscaling models, focusing on integrating various upscalers to achieve the desired output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'detail_processor' input in the SeargeUpscaleModels node?",
        "answer": "The 'detail_processor' input is crucial for improving image quality in the overall upscaling process by processing details in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'high_res_upscaler' input contribute to the output in the SeargeUpscaleModels node?",
        "answer": "The 'high_res_upscaler' input plays a vital role in increasing the resolution of the image, significantly contributing to the final visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'primary_upscaler' input in the SeargeUpscaleModels node?",
        "answer": "The 'primary_upscaler' input is essential in the initial scaling stage, setting the foundation for further enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'secondary_upscaler' input refine the image in the SeargeUpscaleModels node?",
        "answer": "The 'secondary_upscaler' input further refines the image after the primary scaling, improving details and clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SeargeUpscaleModels node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SeargeUpscaleModels node is data that encapsulates the configuration of the upscaling models, which is crucial for subsequent processing and final image output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeUpscaleModels node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModels node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
