        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN pipe2DETAILER node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipe2DETAILER node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance and refine a given pipeline by introducing additional features and processing steps, including bounding box detection, optional segmentation refinement functions, etc., to improve the output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ttN pipe2DETAILER node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ttN pipe2DETAILER node are: 'pipe' (the pipeline to be enhanced and refined), 'bbox_detector' (the bounding box detector used to identify regions of interest in the pipeline output), and 'wildcard' (a flexible input for additional specifications or configurations)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the ttN pipe2DETAILER node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the ttN pipe2DETAILER node are: 'sam_model_opt' (an optional semantic segmentation model for providing additional details via segmentation masks), 'segm_detector_opt' (an optional segmentation detector for further refining the output through segmentation details), and 'detailer_hook' (a hook for customizing the refinement functionality)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ttN pipe2DETAILER node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ttN pipe2DETAILER node are: 'detailer_pipe' (an enhanced and refined version of the input pipeline, containing additional features and processing steps) and 'pipe' (the original input pipeline, returned for reference or further processing)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ttN pipe2DETAILER node use?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipe2DETAILER node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'wildcard' input in the ttN pipe2DETAILER node?",
        "answer": "The 'wildcard' input in the ttN pipe2DETAILER node is a flexible input used for additional specifications or configurations, allowing for customized adjustments to the refinement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'detailer_hook' input in the ttN pipe2DETAILER node allow for?",
        "answer": "The 'detailer_hook' input in the ttN pipe2DETAILER node allows for customization of the refinement functionality, enabling further tailoring of the refinement process."
