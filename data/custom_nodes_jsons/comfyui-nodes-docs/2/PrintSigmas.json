        "question": "What is the primary function of the PrintSigmas node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the PrintSigmas node is to print and return the value of the sigma parameter, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the flow of sigma values in the graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the PrintSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the PrintSigmas node is 'sigmas', which represents the sigma value that needs to be printed and returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'sigmas' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'sigmas' input parameter is SIGMAS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'sigmas' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'sigmas' input parameter is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the PrintSigmas node return as output?",
        "answer": "The PrintSigmas node returns the same sigma value as the input, allowing for further processing or inspection in other parts of the computational graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the PrintSigmas node an output node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the PrintSigmas node is an output node."
    },
