        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPMergeSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPMergeSimple node in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly integrate two separate CLIP models into a unified representation by merging key patches from one model into another based on a specified ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CLIPMergeSimple node?",
        "answer": "The CLIPMergeSimple node requires three inputs: clip1 (the first CLIP model), clip2 (the second CLIP model), and ratio (a float value determining the influence of the second model's patches on the merged model)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ratio parameter affect the merged model in CLIPMergeSimple node?",
        "answer": "The ratio parameter in the CLIPMergeSimple node controls the influence of the second model's patches on the merged model. A higher ratio increases the influence of the second model, while a lower ratio favors the attributes of the first model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CLIPMergeSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CLIPMergeSimple node is a merged CLIP model that combines the features of the two input models, providing a more refined representation for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CLIPMergeSimple node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CLIPMergeSimple node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIPMergeSimple node merge the two input CLIP models?",
        "answer": "The CLIPMergeSimple node merges the two input CLIP models by creating a clone of the first model and adding key patches from the second model based on the specified ratio. This process combines the features of both models into a unified representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CLIPMergeSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPMergeSimple node belongs to the 'advanced/model_merging' category in ComfyUI."
