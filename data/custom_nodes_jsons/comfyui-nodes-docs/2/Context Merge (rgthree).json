        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Merge (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node is designed to integrate multiple context inputs into a unified context output. It systematically merges the provided contexts, allowing later contexts to override values in earlier ones, thus enabling dynamic context management and updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node accepts multiple optional context inputs (ctx_i), each potentially containing different context information that will be merged into the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the optional input ctx_i in the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the optional input ctx_i in the Context Merge (rgthree) node is RGTHREE_CONTEXT in ComfyUI and unknown in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node outputs a unified context (CONTEXT), model information (MODEL), CLIP model settings (CLIP), VAE model settings (VAE), positive conditioning information (POSITIVE), negative conditioning information (NEGATIVE), latent space information (LATENT), image data (IMAGE), and a random number generation seed (SEED)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Context Merge (rgthree) node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the merge function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node do?",
        "answer": "The merge function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node merges any non-null passed contexts, with later ones overriding earlier ones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the get_orig_context_return_tuple function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node return?",
        "answer": "The get_orig_context_return_tuple function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node returns a tuple containing the merged context."
