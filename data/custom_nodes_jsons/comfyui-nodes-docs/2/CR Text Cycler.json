        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_TextCycler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextCycler node is designed to duplicate lines of text a specified number of times within a given loop structure. It is used to automate the text copying process to improve the efficiency of text processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_TextCycler node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_TextCycler node are 'text' and 'repeats'. 'text' is the input text to be cycled, and 'repeats' indicates the number of times each line of text will be copied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the CR_TextCycler node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the CR_TextCycler node is 'loops'. It specifies the number of times the entire text block will be looped through its repetitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CR_TextCycler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CR_TextCycler node is 'show_text'. It provides the final cycled text after all repetitions and loops have been processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the CR_TextCycler node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the CR_TextCycler node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_TextCycler node process the input text?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextCycler node splits the input text into lines and then duplicates each line the specified number of times. It repeats this process for the specified number of loops."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the CR_TextCycler node's 'cycle' function?",
        "answer": "The 'cycle' function of the CR_TextCycler node returns a tuple containing the list of cycled text and a 'show_help' link to the node's documentation."
