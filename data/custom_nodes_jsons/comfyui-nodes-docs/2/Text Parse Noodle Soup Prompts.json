        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Parse_NSP node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Parse_NSP node is designed to process and transform text based on a specified pattern. It utilizes the features of 'Noodle Soup Prompts' for creative text manipulation or uses wildcard replacement methods for more structured processing. This node is essential for tasks requiring text parsing or enhancement, providing a versatile solution for various text-based applications."

    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the WAS_Text_Parse_NSP node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the WAS_Text_Parse_NSP node include:\n\n1. Text: Required. The text parameter is the core input of the node, determining the content that will be subject to parsing and conversion.\n2. Mode: Optional. The mode parameter sets the parsing strategy used by the node. It can be set to 'Noodle Soup Prompts' for creative methods or 'Wildcards' for structured text operations."

    {
        "question": "What is the seed parameter used for?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter is an optional integer that can be used to introduce randomness in the parsing process. It sets a consistent starting point for random operations, ensuring that the results are reproducible."

    {
        "question": "How is the noodle key used in the 'Noodle Soup Prompts' mode?",
        "answer": "In the 'Noodle Soup Prompts' mode, the noodle_key parameter is used as the delimiter in the text to mark the start and end of the terms that can be replaced or operated on. It plays an important role in the parsing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default seed value if it is not specified?",
        "answer": "The default seed value if not specified is 0."
