        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: LoRA Stacks node is designed to process and visualize XY graph data specifically for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) stacks, enabling analysis and comparison of different LoRA configurations and their impact on model efficiency and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node is 'node_state', which indicates whether the node is active and affects whether the LoRA stacks will be processed for XY plotting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node are 'lora_stack_i', where 'i' can range from 1 to 5, allowing for the analysis of multiple LoRA stack configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node is 'X or Y', which represents the XY graph data for the given LoRA stacks, facilitating visualization and comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node handle the case when no LoRA stacks are provided or the node is disabled?",
        "answer": "If no LoRA stacks are provided or the node is disabled, the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node returns (None,)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute represent in the source code of the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the XY Input: LoRA Stacks node, the 'FUNCTION' attribute represents the name of the method that processes the input data, which is 'xy_value' in this case."
