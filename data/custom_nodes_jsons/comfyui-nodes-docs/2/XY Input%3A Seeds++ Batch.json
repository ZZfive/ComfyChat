        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node is designed to generate a series of values representing a batch of seeds, which can be used to control initialization or variation in batch processing. It allows specifying the batch size and outputs a structured seed value representation for batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node is 'batch_count', which specifies the number of seeds to be generated for the batch. It directly affects the size of the output seed sequence, thereby controlling the size of the processed batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'batch_count' input in the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type used for the 'batch_count' input is 'INT'. In Python, the corresponding data type is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node output?",
        "answer": "The 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node outputs a tuple containing the batch type ('Seeds++ Batch') and a list of integers representing the seed values for each batch entry."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node in ComfyUI is 'Efficiency Nodes/XY Inputs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'batch_count' input is set to 0 in the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node?",
        "answer": "If the 'batch_count' input is set to 0 in the 'XY Input: Seeds++ Batch' node, the node will return '(None,)'."
