        "question": "What is the purpose of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node is used to preprocess images to simulate hand-drawn line effects, utilizing a modified HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the FakeScribblePreprocessor node is an image that needs to be processed to simulate hand-drawn lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'safe' parameter in the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' parameter is an optional input that, when enabled, applies safety mechanisms to the preprocessing process, potentially altering the processing method to avoid adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter allows users to adjust the level of detail in the output image by setting the resolution at which the image processing is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node is an image processed from the input image, simulating hand-drawn lines."
