        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatToInt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatToInt node in ComfyUI is designed to convert floating-point numbers to their integer equivalents."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what situations is the FloatToInt node particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The FloatToInt node is crucial in scenarios where precise decimal values need to be converted to integers, facilitating operations that require integer inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'a' parameter in the FloatToInt node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the FloatToInt node is the floating-point number that is to be converted to an integer. It is essential for the node's operation as it directly influences the output, determining the starting value of the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the 'a' parameter in the FloatToInt node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'a' parameter is FLOAT, and the Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output in the FloatToInt node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the FloatToInt node represents the integer representation of the input floating-point number. It signifies the result of the conversion process, providing an integer that can be used in subsequent integer-based calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the 'result' output in the FloatToInt node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'result' output is INT, and the Python dtype is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the FloatToInt node?",
        "answer": "The FloatToInt node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
