        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node is designed to generate a set of nine sinusoidal curves that are entangled and oscillate between zero and one. It uses the keyframed library to create smooth and continuous transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main application of the waveforms generated by the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node?",
        "answer": "The waveforms generated by the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node can be used in various applications such as animation, signal processing, or any scenario that requires sinusoidal wave patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the frequency parameter in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node?",
        "answer": "The frequency parameter determines the rate at which the sinusoidal curves oscillate. It is a key element in shaping the overall behavior of the waveforms generated by the node. Changes in frequency directly affect the periodicity and speed of the oscillations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the frequency parameter in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the frequency parameter is float in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node is a tuple of nine keyframed sinusoidal curves. Each curve represents a unique oscillation within the entangled waveform, as part of the overall complex pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output in the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output is a tuple of kf.SinusoidalCurve objects in Python, and a COMBO of kf.SinusoidalCurve in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx9 node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
