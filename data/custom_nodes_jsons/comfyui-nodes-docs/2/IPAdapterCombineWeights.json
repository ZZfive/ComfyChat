        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterCombineWeights node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterCombineWeights node in ComfyUI supports weight scheduling, allowing users to adjust the influence of images over different time periods, achieving smooth transitions and animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the IPAdapterCombineWeights node more efficient compared to using gradient masks?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterCombineWeights node is lighter and more efficient than using gradient masks for achieving smooth transitions and animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weights' output represent in the IPAdapterCombineWeights node?",
        "answer": "The 'weights' output represents the result of applying the specified method to the input weights. It contains the essence of the node's purpose, providing a synthesized form of the input data that can be used for further analysis or model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'weights' output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'weights' output uses the FLOAT data type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output represent in the IPAdapterCombineWeights node?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output represents the number of input weights. It is an important attribute of the node, used to describe the scale and scope of the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the IPAdapterCombineWeights node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the IPAdapterCombineWeights node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the input weights processed in the 'combine' function of the IPAdapterCombineWeights node?",
        "answer": "In the 'combine' function of the IPAdapterCombineWeights node, if the input weights are not lists, they are converted into lists. Then, the two lists of weights are concatenated to form the final 'weights' output."
