        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfCurveDraw node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfCurveDraw node in ComfyUI visualizes a given curve by drawing it and generating an image representation. It aims to provide a visual analysis tool for understanding the trend and fluctuation of data points within the curve over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'curve' parameter in the KfCurveDraw node?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' parameter is essential for the KfCurveDraw node as it defines the dataset to be visualized. It contains keyframes representing specific points in time, each with a corresponding value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'n' parameter affect the visualization in the KfCurveDraw node?",
        "answer": "The 'n' parameter determines the number of points drawn on the curve, which affects the granularity of the visualization. It ensures that the curve is adequately represented for analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_legend' parameter do in the KfCurveDraw node?",
        "answer": "When the 'show_legend' parameter is enabled, a legend is added to the chart, providing a reference for each curve and enhancing the clarity of the visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the KfCurveDraw node?",
        "answer": "The output of the KfCurveDraw node is an image tensor representing the drawn curve. It serves as a visual summary of the data, allowing for easy interpretation and further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfCurveDraw node use?",
        "answer": "The KfCurveDraw node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'n' parameter in the KfCurveDraw node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'n' parameter in the KfCurveDraw node is 64."
