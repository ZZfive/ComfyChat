        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node generates a sinusoidal curve with adjustable frequency, phase, and amplitude, simulating periodic motion patterns. It is designed to provide a versatile tool for creating smooth, oscillating transitions in projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frequency parameter control in the KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The frequency parameter determines the rate at which the sinusoidal curve oscillates, with higher values resulting in faster and more frequent cycles. This is crucial for setting the tempo and rhythm of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the phase parameter affect the sinusoidal curve in KfSinusoidalWithFrequency?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter shifts the sinusoidal curve along the timeline, allowing control over the starting point of the oscillations. This is important for aligning actions with specific events or actions in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the amplitude parameter in KfSinusoidalWithFrequency?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter controls the range of the oscillations, determining the peak and trough values of the sinusoidal curve. It affects the overall intensity and magnitude of the motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node has two output types: 'curve', which is a keyframed curve object containing the sinusoidal pattern, and 'sinusoidal_curve', which provides the sinusoidal curve in a format that can be directly applied to visual elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node use?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalWithFrequency node is implemented as a class with input types for frequency, phase, and amplitude, and a main function that creates a SinusoidalCurve object using these parameters. The function returns the curve object as both a keyframed curve and a sinusoidal curve output."
