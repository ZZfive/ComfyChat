        "question": "What is the purpose of the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node is designed to manage the denoise schedule during the detailer process. It provides a mechanism to adjust the applied denoise level at different stages of the process, ensuring a smooth transition from a noisy to a detailed state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node are: schedule_for_cycle (STRING) and target_denoise (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the schedule_for_cycle parameter determine in the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The schedule_for_cycle parameter determines the denoise schedule to be followed within the detailer cycle. It is crucial as it dictates the sequence of denoise steps, thereby influencing the quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target_denoise parameter specify in the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The target_denoise parameter specifies the desired level of denoise. It is important as it directly affects the clarity and detail of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node is DETAILER_HOOK, which encapsulates the denoise schedule and directly influences the detailer's behavior during the denoise process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node use?",
        "answer": "The DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what class method is used to define the input types for the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the class method INPUT_TYPES is used to define the input types for the DenoiseSchedulerDetailerHookProvider node."
