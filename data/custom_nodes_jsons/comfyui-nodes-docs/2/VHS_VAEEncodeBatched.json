        "question": "What is the main purpose of the VAEEncodeBatched node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of the VAEEncodeBatched node is to efficiently encode batches of video frames into latent space representations using a variational autoencoder (VAE)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the VAEEncodeBatched node are 'pixels' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'vae' (Comfy dtype: VAE, Python dtype: torch.nn.Module)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pixels' parameter represent in the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' parameter represents the raw video frames that need to be encoded. It is a crucial input for the VAEEncodeBatched node's performance and the quality of the generated latent space representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae' parameter specify in the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter specifies the variational autoencoder model that the node will use to encode the video frames. It determines the structure and characteristics of the latent space of the frame encodings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'per_batch' parameter in the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The 'per_batch' parameter defines the size of each pixel batch that the node will process. It is important for managing memory usage and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with high-resolution or large volumes of video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the VAEEncodeBatched node is 'samples' (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which contains the encoded latent space representations of the input video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the VAEEncodeBatched node is GPU."
