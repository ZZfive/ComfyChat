        "question": "What does the 'comfyui-nodes-docs' file contain?",
        "answer": "The 'comfyui-nodes-docs' file contains comprehensive documentation and guides for various custom nodes and plug-ins that extend the functionality of ComfyUI, a GUI that generates images and videos using a stable diffusion model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are custom nodes and plug-ins in ComfyUI extended?",
        "answer": "Custom nodes and plug-ins in ComfyUI are extended through the use of Python, making it possible to create additional functionalities for generating images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the cg-noise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise node in ComfyUI is used to replace KSampler and KSampler Advanced, offering the ability to generate small variations based on noise in initial frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when a custom node or plugin does not have stored data?",
        "answer": "If a custom node or plugin does not have stored data, ComfyUI will generate it using a re-learning function designed for the specific node or plugin."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'relearn' button in the 'analysis' module?",
        "answer": "The 'relearn' button in the 'analysis' module is used to disable the existing model and automatically re-learn the model for the specified node or plug-in."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cg-noise node generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise node generates variations in images by using a formula that takes a weight `x` and two seeds. The noise is generated based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are non-lossy custom nodes in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Non-lossy custom nodes in ComfyUI do not suffer any loss of information after the re-learning process, allowing them to retain their original functionality."
