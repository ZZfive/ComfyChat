        "question": "What is the purpose of the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI applies histogram equalization to an image by redistributing the intensity levels, thereby enhancing the image's contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the EqualizeHistogram node is the source image (src) that needs to be processed. Histogram equalization will be applied to this image to enhance its contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the source image input for EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the source image input is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the EqualizeHistogram node output?",
        "answer": "The EqualizeHistogram node outputs the image after applying histogram equalization, which has enhanced contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the output image from the EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output image is IMAGE, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the EqualizeHistogram node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name and category of the EqualizeHistogram node in the source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the function name for the EqualizeHistogram node is 'eq', and the category is 'Bmad/CV/Thresholding'."
