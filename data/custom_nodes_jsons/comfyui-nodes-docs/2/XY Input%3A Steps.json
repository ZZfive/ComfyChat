    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the XY Input: Steps node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the XY Input: Steps node include target_parameter, batch_count, first_step, last_step, first_start_step, last_start_step, first_end_step, last_end_step, first_refine_step, and last_refine_step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target_parameter input specify in the XY Input: Steps node?",
        "answer": "The target_parameter input in the XY Input: Steps node specifies the target parameter used for generating step values, which affects the sequence generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the batch_count input in the XY Input: Steps node?",
        "answer": "The batch_count input in the XY Input: Steps node determines the number of values to be generated, directly influencing the length of the output sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the XY Input: Steps node produce?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Steps node outputs a tuple containing the generated step sequence type (X or Y) and the sequence itself, which is convenient for further processing or visualization."
