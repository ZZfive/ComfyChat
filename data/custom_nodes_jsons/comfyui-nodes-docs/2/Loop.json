        "question": "What is the class name of the custom node documented in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the custom node documented in ComfyUI is Loop."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Loop node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Loop node belongs to the DragNUWA category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Loop node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the Loop node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Loop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Loop node in ComfyUI encapsulates the iterative processing process and can execute a series of operations or algorithms in a loop. It is designed to facilitate the control flow of repetitive tasks, allowing dynamic adjustments and combining user-defined logic in the loop structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Loop node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Loop node is 'required', which is crucial for defining the conditions for loop execution. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that the loop only runs when the specified requirements are met, thus affecting the overall execution process and operation results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Loop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Loop node is 'LOOP', which represents the node itself and encapsulates the result of the iterative process. It represents the culmination of the loop operation sequence, providing a structured and controlled way to output the final state of the loop execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Loop node use in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Loop node uses the CPU infrastructure type in ComfyUI."
