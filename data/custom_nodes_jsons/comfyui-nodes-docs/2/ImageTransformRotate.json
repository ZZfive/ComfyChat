        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageTransformRotate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformRotate node in ComfyUI is used to rotate a batch of images by a specified angle. It supports optional image expansion to fully accommodate the rotated image and employs supersampling antialiasing (SSAA) for higher quality results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageTransformRotate node are: images (the batch of images to be rotated), angle (the angle by which the images will be rotated), expand (a boolean flag indicating whether the image should be expanded to fit the rotated image without cropping), SSAA (the level of supersampling antialiasing to be applied), and method (the method to be used for rotating the image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'expand' parameter do in the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The 'expand' parameter in the ImageTransformRotate node is a boolean flag that indicates whether the image should be expanded to accommodate the rotated image without cropping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SSAA parameter in the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The SSAA parameter in the ImageTransformRotate node indicates the level of supersampling antialiasing to be applied to the image to improve the quality of the rotation. Higher SSAA values result in smoother edges and reduced aliasing, thus improving the visual quality of the rotated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different methods available for rotating images in the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformRotate node supports various methods for rotating images, including lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageTransformRotate node is 'image', which represents the rotated images returned in batch form."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageTransformRotate node handle the case when the rotation angle is 0 or 360 degrees?",
        "answer": "When the rotation angle is 0 or 360 degrees, the ImageTransformRotate node simply returns the original input images without applying any rotation."
