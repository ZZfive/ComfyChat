        "question": "What is the purpose of the AlphaChanelRestore node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AlphaChanelRestore node in ComfyUI is designed to process images and ensure that all images have an alpha channel. It does this by adding or restoring the missing alpha channel, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in image data, especially when dealing with image processing pipelines that require images to have the same number of channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the AlphaChanelRestore node is 'images', which represents a batch of images to be processed. This input is essential for identifying which images are missing an alpha channel and subsequently adding one to ensure all images in the batch have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the 'images' input in the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the 'images' input in the AlphaChanelRestore node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'images' input in the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'images' input in the AlphaChanelRestore node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The output of the AlphaChanelRestore node is a batch of images with an alpha channel added if necessary, ensuring all images have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the output in the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the output in the AlphaChanelRestore node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output in the AlphaChanelRestore node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the output in the AlphaChanelRestore node is 'torch.Tensor'."
