        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageFilterStackBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterStackBlur node in ComfyUI applies a stack blur effect to an image, simulating a bokeh-like blur by blending pixels within a certain radius around each point, resulting in a smooth and even effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageFilterStackBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImageFilterStackBlur node are: images (the image to which the stack blur effect will be applied), size_x (the horizontal size of the blur effect), and size_y (the vertical size of the blur effect)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_x input specify in the ImageFilterStackBlur node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageFilterStackBlur node, the size_x input specifies the horizontal size of the blur effect, affecting the width of the area considered for blurring around each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_y input specify in the ImageFilterStackBlur node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageFilterStackBlur node, the size_y input specifies the vertical size of the blur effect, affecting the height of the area considered for blurring around each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageFilterStackBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageFilterStackBlur node is an image that has the stack blur effect applied, presenting a smooth and visually appealing blur effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infratype does the ImageFilterStackBlur node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterStackBlur node uses the GPU infratype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageFilterStackBlur node achieve the stack blur effect in the source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the ImageFilterStackBlur node achieves the stack blur effect by using the cv2.stackBlur function from the OpenCV library, which is applied to the input image with the specified size_x and size_y values."
