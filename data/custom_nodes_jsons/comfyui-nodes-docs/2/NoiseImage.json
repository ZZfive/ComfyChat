        "question": "What is the purpose of the NoiseImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NoiseImage node generates an image with noise on a solid color background based on specified noise levels, providing a versatile tool for image data testing and visual experiments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the NoiseImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the NoiseImage node are width, height, noise_level, and color_hex."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the width parameter affect the output of the NoiseImage node?",
        "answer": "The width parameter determines the horizontal dimension of the output image, which is crucial for defining the canvas on which the noise pattern is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the noise_level parameter control in the NoiseImage node?",
        "answer": "The noise_level parameter controls the intensity of the random noise applied to the image, directly affecting the visual effect and complexity of the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the color_hex parameter in the NoiseImage node?",
        "answer": "The color_hex parameter defines the base color of the image background, which serves as the foundation for the noise pattern overlay."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the NoiseImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the NoiseImage node is an image with noise, reflecting the input parameters, which becomes a key artifact for further analysis or operations in the image processing workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the NoiseImage node use?",
        "answer": "The NoiseImage node uses the CPU infra type."
