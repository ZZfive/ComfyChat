        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the CR_TextList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextList node is designed to process and manipulate text data, specifically for creating lists from multiline text input. It allows users to select a subset of text lines based on a starting index and the maximum number of lines to include, providing a streamlined method for managing text lists within the Comfyroll framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'multiline_text' parameter in the CR_TextList node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiline_text' parameter is the main input for the CR_TextList node. It accepts a block of text that may contain multiple lines and plays a key role in determining the source material from which the list will be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_index' parameter function in the CR_TextList node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_index' parameter specifies the position in the text where the list generation should begin. It is important for controlling the starting point of the text lines to be included in the final list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'max_rows' parameter play in the CR_TextList node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_rows' parameter sets a limit on the number of text lines to be included in the list. It is crucial for defining the scope of the text data that the node processes and returns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'selected_rows' output of the CR_TextList node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_rows' output contains the text lines selected based on the input parameters. It represents the core result of the node's operation, encapsulating the processed text data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_TextList node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to documentation for further help or guidance on using the node. It is a valuable resource for users seeking more information about the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_TextList node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextList node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
