        "question": "What is the purpose of the wildcardsPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The wildcardsPrompt node is designed to handle and modify text input by replacing options and wildcards, enhancing the versatility and interactivity of the text. It achieves this by identifying patterns and keywords in the input and replacing them with corresponding elements from a predefined dictionary or through random selection, thereby generating modified output text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text' parameter in the wildcardsPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is crucial for the operation of the node, as it provides the raw content that will be processed. It serves as the foundation for all replacements and modifications and is a key input for achieving the node's purpose."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter contribute to the functionality of the wildcardsPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter introduces reproducibility in the randomization process within the node. By setting a specific seed, the randomness in the option and wildcard replacements can be controlled, ensuring consistent results across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output text represent in the wildcardsPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output text is the result of the node's processing, where the original input text has been replaced and enhanced. It represents the culmination of the node's functionality, showcasing the transformed content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the wildcardsPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the wildcardsPrompt node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'main' function in the wildcardsPrompt class?",
        "answer": "The 'main' function is responsible for processing the input text based on the provided parameters, such as 'prompt', 'seed', and 'multiline_mode'. It handles the replacement of options and wildcards in the input text and returns the modified text as output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'process' function in the wildcardsPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'process' function is called within the 'main' function to handle the actual replacement of options and wildcards in the input text. It takes the text and seed as input and returns the modified text with the replacements applied."
