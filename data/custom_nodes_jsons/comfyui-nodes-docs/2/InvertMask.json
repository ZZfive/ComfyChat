        "question": "What is the purpose of the `invert` method in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The `invert` method in the InvertMask node is designed to perform a simple but crucial operation in image processing. It inverts the input mask, effectively reversing pixel values from 0 to 1 and vice versa, which is often necessary for certain types of image operations or enhancement tasks."

    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mask' parameter in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is the input for the `invert` method and is crucial for the node's operation. It represents the original mask that needs to be inverted. The inversion process is fundamental as it can significantly change the context and application of the mask in downstream tasks."

    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the 'mask' parameter in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the 'mask' parameter in the InvertMask node is MASK."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'mask' parameter in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'mask' parameter in the InvertMask node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the `invert` method in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the `invert` method in the InvertMask node is a new mask that is the inversion of the input mask. This output is important as it represents the transformed state of the original mask, ready for subsequent image processing steps."

    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the output in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the output in the InvertMask node is MASK."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output in the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the output in the InvertMask node is torch.Tensor."

        "question": "What is the infra type for the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the InvertMask node is CPU."
