        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeEnablerInputs class?",
        "answer": "The SeargeEnablerInputs class is designed to retrieve and manage system states, serving as an interface for state-related operations within a deprecated framework. It abstracts the state retrieval process and emphasizes the role of nodes in maintaining and providing access to the current system state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'state' parameter in the SeargeEnablerInputs class?",
        "answer": "The 'state' parameter is crucial for the operation of the SeargeEnablerInputs class because it represents the current state of the system. It is the fundamental element that determines the behavior of the node and generates the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type for the 'state' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for the 'state' parameter is COMBO[SeargeParameterProcessor.STATES]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'state' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'state' parameter is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'state' represent in the SeargeEnablerInputs class?",
        "answer": "The output 'state' reflects the input provided system current state, indicating that the main function of the node is state management and retrieval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SeargeEnablerInputs class?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SeargeEnablerInputs class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SeargeEnablerInputs class?",
        "answer": "The category of the SeargeEnablerInputs class is 'Searge/_deprecated_/Inputs'."
