        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntToFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntToFloat node is designed to convert integer values to their floating-point equivalents, ensuring consistent data types during numerical calculations and maintaining the accuracy of the calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'a' parameter in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'a' represents the integer value to be converted to a floating-point number. It is crucial to the operation of the node as it determines the starting point of the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'a' parameter in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'a' parameter is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'a' parameter in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'a' parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output is the floating-point representation of the input integer. It is important because it provides the converted value that can be used for subsequent numerical calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'result' output in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'result' output is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'result' output in the IntToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'result' output is float."
