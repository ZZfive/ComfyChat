        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SimplePromptList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SimplePromptList node is designed to efficiently aggregate and manage lists of prompts. Its purpose is to stack multiple prompts into a single list that can be used for various downstream processing tasks in animation workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is 'prompt_1' a required input for the CR_SimplePromptList node?",
        "answer": "Yes, 'prompt_1' is a required text input for the CR_SimplePromptList node. It allows users to inject a specific prompt into the processing flow, contributing directly to the final aggregated list of prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'simple_prompt_list' input allow users to do in the CR_SimplePromptList node?",
        "answer": "The 'simple_prompt_list' input is an optional parameter that allows the node to accept a pre-existing list of prompts. This feature enhances the node's flexibility by allowing users to extend or modify the list of prompts with additional entries, affecting the overall aggregation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the SIMPLE_PROMPT_LIST output in the CR_SimplePromptList node?",
        "answer": "The SIMPLE_PROMPT_LIST output represents the aggregated list of prompts produced by the node's operations. It is a critical component as it forms the basis for further processing or analysis in animation workflows, highlighting the node's contribution to prompt management."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output in the CR_SimplePromptList node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL linking to a documentation page for further assistance. It serves as a helpful resource for users seeking more information on effectively utilizing the node in their animation projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the CR_SimplePromptList node require a CPU for infrastructure type?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CR_SimplePromptList node indicates that it uses a CPU for its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_SimplePromptList node's prompt_stacker function handle empty inputs?",
        "answer": "The prompt_stacker function in the CR_SimplePromptList node extends the list of prompts only if the respective inputs (prompt_1 to prompt_5) are not empty. This ensures that only non-empty prompts are added to the final aggregated list."
