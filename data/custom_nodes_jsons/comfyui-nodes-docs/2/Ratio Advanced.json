        "question": "What is the main purpose of the RatioAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RatioAdvanced node in ComfyUI is designed to perform advanced ratio calculations and conversions. It handles preset ratios, custom input dimensions, and various scaling operations to determine optimal sizes at different stages of the image processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'preset' parameter in the RatioAdvanced node allow the user to do?",
        "answer": "The 'preset' parameter allows the user to select a predefined ratio configuration. This selection simplifies the process of applying known sets of ratios to images, ensuring consistency and reducing manual calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'swap_axis' parameter used in the RatioAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_axis' parameter enables the swapping of width and height values when necessary. This is useful for adjusting the orientation of an image without altering its inherent aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'custom_latent_w' and 'custom_latent_h' parameters specify when a custom ratio is selected in the RatioAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "When a custom ratio is selected, the 'custom_latent_w' parameter specifies the width of the latent image, and the 'custom_latent_h' parameter specifies the height. These parameters allow fine-tuning of image dimensions at specific processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_w' output represent in the RatioAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_w' output represents the width of the latent image based on the input parameters and ratio calculations performed by the node. This value is crucial for determining the horizontal dimension of the image at specific stages in the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'cte_w' output relate to Constant Time Evolution (CTE) in the RatioAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'cte_w' output indicates the image width after applying the Constant Time Evolution (CTE) ratio. This parameter is important for maintaining the temporal consistency of the image across different processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for using the RatioAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The documentation suggests using the CPU as the infra type for the RatioAdvanced node."
