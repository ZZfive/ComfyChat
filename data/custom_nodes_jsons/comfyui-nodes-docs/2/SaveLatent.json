        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaveLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaveLatent node in ComfyUI is designed to save the latent representation of samples to disk. It processes the storage procedure by converting the latent tensor into a file format that can be easily retrieved and used for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'samples' parameter in the SaveLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter is crucial as it contains the latent representation that needs to be saved. It directly influences the operation of the node by determining the data that is written to the output file."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'filename_prefix' parameter affect the output in SaveLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter defines the starting part of the filename of the saved latent file. It affects how the files are organized and named in the output directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'prompt' parameter in SaveLatent node?",
        "answer": "When provided, the 'prompt' parameter adds a description to the metadata of the saved latent file, which is useful for tracking the context in which the latent representation was generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can be stored in the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter in SaveLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter allows for the inclusion of additional information in the metadata of the latent file. This is useful for storing any extra details that may be relevant to the analysis or usage of the latent data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ui' parameter in the output of SaveLatent node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' parameter in the output is a dictionary containing information about the saved latent file, including the filename and subfolder, which can be used for user interface display or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the usage of SaveLatent node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the usage of SaveLatent node is CPU."
