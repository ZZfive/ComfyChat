        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Number_To_Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_To_Float node is designed to convert the input number to its floating-point equivalent, ensuring numerical consistency and compatibility for downstream operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'number' parameter in the WAS_Number_To_Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it is the input that will be converted to a float. This conversion is essential for maintaining numerical precision and facilitating further mathematical calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'number' parameter in the WAS_Number_To_Float node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'number' parameter is NUMBER, while in Python, it can be either int, float, or str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Number_To_Float node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Number_To_Float node is 'float_number', which provides the floating-point representation of the input number. This output is crucial for any subsequent numerical analysis or operations requiring decimal precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'float_number' output in the WAS_Number_To_Float node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'float_number' output is FLOAT, while in Python, it is float."
