    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter for the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node because it serves as the input for the preprocessing algorithm. The quality and resolution of the image directly affect the effectiveness of the preprocessing and the accuracy of the resulting segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'mask' parameter in the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'mask' parameter in the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node provides additional context for the preprocessing step, allowing for more targeted adjustments to the image. It can help refine the segmentation process by focusing on specific regions of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessed image optimized for segmentation tasks. This output serves as input for subsequent segmentation nodes, ensuring that the segmentation process benefits from the enhanced color attributes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belongs to the 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the Color_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'SEGS_PREPROCESSOR'."
