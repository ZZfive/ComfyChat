        "question": "What is the RegionalIPAdapterMask node designed for?",
        "answer": "The RegionalIPAdapterMask node is designed to adapt and process regional image data. It allows for targeted modifications to specific regions of images without altering the entire dataset, enhancing control over image transformation and adaptation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the weight parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The weight parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node influences the intensity of the node's processing. It adjusts the strength of region adaptation applied to the image, allowing for fine-tuning of the output based on desired effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the noise parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The noise parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node introduces variability to the node's processing. It adds a degree of randomness to region adaptation, which helps create more natural or diverse output variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node are:\n\n1. mask - This is a mask parameter essential for defining the region of the image that will be affected by the node. It determines which parts of the image will be influenced by the node's processing. \n2. image - This is an image parameter necessary as the base input for the node's operation. It is the original data that the node will process according to the mask and other parameters.\n3. weight - This is a weight parameter that affects the strength of the node's processing. It adjusts the intensity of region adaptation applied to the image, allowing for fine-tuning of the output based on desired effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the unfold_batch parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The unfold_batch parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node is used to change the way the node processes image data. When enabled, it can improve the efficiency of the node's operations, especially when handling large batches of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type for the RegionalIPAdapterMask node is a regionally adapted image. This output is the result of the node's processing, which has been adjusted according to the input parameters for regional handling and enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the start_at parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node?",
        "answer": "The default value of the start_at parameter in the RegionalIPAdapterMask node is 0.0. This parameter sets the starting point for weight application in the node's processing, allowing for a controlled transition in region adaptation."
