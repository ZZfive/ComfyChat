        "question": "What is the purpose of the GuidedFilterAlpha node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GuidedFilterAlpha node in ComfyUI applies a guided filter to an image using a specified alpha channel and filtering parameters. This process smooths and enhances the image while preserving edges, utilizing the alpha channel to control the blending and level of detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the GuidedFilterAlpha node are: images (the input image to be filtered, where the alpha channel is used to guide the filtering process), alpha (the alpha channel used to guide the filtering process, affecting how details are blended and preserved in the image), filter_radius (specifies the radius of the filter, influencing the degree of smoothing and edge preservation), and sigma (controls the degree of smoothing, with higher values producing more blur)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the filter_radius parameter control in the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "In the GuidedFilterAlpha node, the filter_radius parameter specifies the radius of the filter, which influences the degree of smoothing and edge preservation applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the sigma parameter affect the output of the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "In the GuidedFilterAlpha node, the sigma parameter controls the degree of smoothing applied to the image. Higher values of sigma will produce more blur in the filtered image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GuidedFilterAlpha node is an IMAGE, which represents the filtered image after the guided filtering has been applied based on the alpha channel and filtering parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the GuidedFilterAlpha node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the filter_radius parameter in the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the filter_radius parameter in the GuidedFilterAlpha node is 8."
