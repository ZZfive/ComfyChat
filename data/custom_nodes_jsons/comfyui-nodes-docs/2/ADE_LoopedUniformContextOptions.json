        "question": "What is the purpose of LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode is designed to generate a series of context options for animation purposes. It creates a uniform distribution of contexts based on given parameters, ensuring consistent flow of animation frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'context_length' parameter determine in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_length' parameter decides the length of each context in the animation sequence. It is crucial for defining the scope of each context and influences the overall structure of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'context_stride' parameter affect the animation sequence in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_stride' parameter specifies the step size between consecutive contexts. It affects the degree of association between each context and its neighbors, influencing the coherence of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'context_overlap' parameter in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'context_overlap' parameter defines the amount of overlap between adjacent contexts. This is important for ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining visual continuity between contexts in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'closed_loop' parameter indicate in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'closed_loop' parameter indicates whether the animation should loop back to the beginning after the last context. This can be used to create seamless, repeating animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'fuse_method' parameter in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'fuse_method' parameter determines how contexts are fused together in the animation. It can influence the blending and merging of contexts, affecting the final appearance of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_percent' parameter affect the animation sequence in LoopedUniformContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter defines the starting percentage of the context in the animation sequence. It is used to control the timing of when each context begins."
