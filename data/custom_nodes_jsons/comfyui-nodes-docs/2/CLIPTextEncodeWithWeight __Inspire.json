        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI is designed to encode text input using the CLIP model while applying specified strength and additional weight adjustments during the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node are 'text' (the text to be encoded), 'clip' (the CLIP model used for encoding), 'strength' (the multiplier for encoding strength), and 'add_weight' (the additional weight applied to the encoding)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter do in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node adjusts the strength of the text representation in the embedding space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'add_weight' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The 'add_weight' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node allows for fine-tuning the bias of the embedding vector, providing a way to subtly alter its characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node is 'conditioning', which is an object containing the encoded text and any specified adjustments, suitable for further processing or generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the CLIPTextEncodeWithWeight node in ComfyUI is 'InspirePack/Util'."
