        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "Cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`. This ensures that the generated noise is consistent but slightly different each time, adding an element of unpredictability to the image generation process."
