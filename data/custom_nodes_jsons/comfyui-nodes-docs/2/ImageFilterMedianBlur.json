        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageFilterMedianBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMedianBlur node applies a median blur filter to images, effectively reducing noise and smoothing the image while preserving edges. It is particularly useful for removing salt-and-pepper noise from images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageFilterMedianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMedianBlur node requires two input types: 'images' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) which specifies the images to be processed, and 'size' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int) which defines the size of the kernel used for median blurring."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the median blur effect in the ImageFilterMedianBlur node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageFilterMedianBlur node, a larger 'size' value will produce a more pronounced blurring effect on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageFilterMedianBlur node?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMedianBlur node outputs the processed image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) after applying the median blur filter, resulting in reduced noise and a smoother appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ImageFilterMedianBlur node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMedianBlur node uses the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageFilterMedianBlur node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageFilterMedianBlur node is not an output node in ComfyUI. Its 'Output node' property is set to 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which category does the ImageFilterMedianBlur node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMedianBlur node falls under the 'image/filter' category in ComfyUI."
