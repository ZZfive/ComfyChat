        "question": "What is the purpose of the DeepDanbooruCaption node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DeepDanbooruCaption node in ComfyUI is used to generate caption text for images using the DeepDanbooru model. It processes the image to identify and describe its content using tags."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the DeepDanbooruCaption node are: image (the image to generate caption text for), threshold (the confidence threshold for including tags in the caption), sort_alpha (whether to sort the tags alphabetically), use_spaces (whether to use spaces between tags), escape (whether to escape special characters in tags), and filter_tags (a list of tags to exclude from the caption)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter control in the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in the DeepDanbooruCaption node controls the confidence threshold for including tags in the caption text. Tags with a confidence score below this threshold will be excluded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'filter_tags' parameter in the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The 'filter_tags' parameter in the DeepDanbooruCaption node is used to specify a list of tags that should be excluded from the generated caption text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the DeepDanbooruCaption node are: device_mode (specifies the device mode to run the DeepDanbooru model on, such as CPU, GPU, or AUTO), prefix (a prefix to add before each caption), suffix (a suffix to add after each caption), and enabled (enables or disables the caption generation functionality)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DeepDanbooruCaption node is the generated caption text for the input image, which may be modified by a prefix and suffix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the DeepDanbooruCaption node is GPU."
