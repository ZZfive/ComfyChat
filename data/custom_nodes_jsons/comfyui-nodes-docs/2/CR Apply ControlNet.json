        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ApplyControlNet node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ApplyControlNet node in ComfyUI is designed to integrate ControlNet into the image generation process, allowing for the application of specific conditions and adjustments to refine the output. It plays a key role in enhancing the controllability and quality of generated images through the use of strength parameters and a switch mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR_ApplyControlNet node are conditioning, control_net, image, switch, and strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conditioning' input parameter do in the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' parameter is crucial for defining the initial state or context for image generation. It lays the foundation for the operation of the control network and has a significant impact on the characteristics of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'strength' parameter in the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter adjusts the intensity of the control network's influence on the image generation process. It allows for fine-tuning the effect of the control network to achieve a balance between control and creativity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR_ApplyControlNet node are CONDITIONING and show_help."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a documentation link to further assist and guide the effective use of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CR_ApplyControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CR_ApplyControlNet node is CPU."
