        "question": "What is the purpose of the CSV Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CSV Curve node is designed to parse and apply animation curves based on CSV file data. It dynamically generates animation parameters by parsing the contents of the CSV file, supporting interpolation and custom CSV parsing processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'frame_counter' parameter in the CSV Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_counter' parameter is crucial for tracking the current frame of the animation. It ensures that the curve's application remains synchronized with the overall animation sequence's timing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'first_column_type' parameter affect the interpretation of the CSV file data?",
        "answer": "The 'first_column_type' parameter determines whether the first column of the CSV file represents seconds or frames. This influences how the data is interpreted within the context of animation timing. Accurately setting this parameter is essential for correctly mapping the data to the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'interpolate' parameter play in the CSV Curve node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolate' parameter controls whether interpolation is performed between data points in the CSV file. Enabling interpolation results in smoother animation curves, enhancing the fluidity and naturalness of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'csv_dialect' parameter contribute to the CSV Curve node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'csv_dialect' parameter specifies the dialect of the CSV file, enabling the node to accurately parse files with different formatting conventions. This enhances the node's compatibility, allowing it to handle various CSV formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CSV Curve node generate?",
        "answer": "The CSV Curve node generates two output types: FLOAT, representing a point on the animation curve with high precision, and INT, providing an integer representation of the generated animation curve point for parameters requiring discrete values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CSV Curve node use?",
        "answer": "The CSV Curve node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
