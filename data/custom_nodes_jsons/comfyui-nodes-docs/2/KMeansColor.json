        "question": "What is the purpose of the KMeansColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node in ComfyUI applies the K-means clustering algorithm to an image to simplify its color palette to a specified number of colors. This process is useful for color quantization, reducing the number of colors in an image while preserving its basic visual features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node requires three input types: 'image' (the input image to be processed), 'number_of_colors' (the desired number of colors in the simplified color palette), and 'max_iterations' (the maximum number of iterations allowed for the K-means algorithm to converge)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'number_of_colors' input parameter specify in the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'number_of_colors' input parameter in the KMeansColor node specifies the desired number of colors in the simplified color palette after the color quantization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'max_iterations' input parameter affect the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_iterations' input parameter in the KMeansColor node determines the maximum number of iterations allowed for the K-means algorithm to converge to a solution. It affects the running time and precision of the algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'eps' input parameter in the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'eps' input parameter in the KMeansColor node represents the epsilon value for the convergence criterion. A smaller value makes the algorithm more accurate but may increase the computation time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KMeansColor node is 'image', which represents the processed image with its color palette simplified to the specified number of colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the KMeansColor node is 'GPU'."
