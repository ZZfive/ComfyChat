        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN advanced xyPlot node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN advanced xyPlot node in ComfyUI is designed to provide advanced plotting capabilities, allowing the generation and manipulation of XY plots with enhanced features such as grid spacing, latent index consideration, and individual output control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'grid_spacing' parameter control in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'grid_spacing' parameter in the ttN advanced xyPlot node specifies the spacing between points on the grid, affecting the density and separation of plotted points, which in turn influences the granularity and overall appearance of the chart."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'latent_index' parameter function in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_index' parameter in the ttN advanced xyPlot node identifies a specific latent dimension or index to be visualized, allowing for targeted exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data spaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'output_individuals' parameter in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_individuals' parameter in the ttN advanced xyPlot node controls whether individual data points are output separately, enabling detailed examination and analysis of each point in the chart."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the x and y axes be swapped in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'flip_xy' parameter in the ttN advanced xyPlot node determines whether the x and y axes are swapped, allowing for the presentation of plotted data from an alternative perspective and direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data does the 'adv_xyPlot' output type contain in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'adv_xyPlot' output type in the ttN advanced xyPlot node contains a dictionary encapsulating the chart data, including x and y coordinates, grid spacing, latent index, and output control information, providing a comprehensive configuration of the plot."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ttN advanced xyPlot node run on?",
        "answer": "The ttN advanced xyPlot node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
