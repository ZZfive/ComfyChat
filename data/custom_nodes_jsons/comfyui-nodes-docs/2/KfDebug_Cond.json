        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Cond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Cond node in ComfyUI is designed to provide a way to visualize and understand the conditioning aspect of keyframed models. It is very useful for debugging to ensure that the conditioning data is being processed correctly, thus allowing for more informed model optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfDebug_Cond node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfDebug_Cond node is 'conditioning_data', which represents the input data used to condition the model's output. Correctly handling this parameter is crucial for the node to function properly and for the effectiveness of the debugging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the 'conditioning_data' input in the KfDebug_Cond node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning_data' input in the KfDebug_Cond node has a Comfy dtype of 'torch.Tensor' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'debug_info' output of the KfDebug_Cond node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'debug_info' output of the KfDebug_Cond node contains valuable information about the conditioning process. This information can be used to identify any issues with model conditioning, thus facilitating debugging and optimization processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the 'debug_info' output in the KfDebug_Cond node?",
        "answer": "The 'debug_info' output in the KfDebug_Cond node has a Comfy dtype of 'dict' and a Python dtype of 'Dict[str, Any]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfDebug_Cond node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfDebug_Cond node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code for the KfDebug_Cond node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the KfDebug_Cond node is: ```class KfDebug_Cond(KfDebug_Passthrough):\n    RETURN_TYPES = ('CONDITIONING',)```"
