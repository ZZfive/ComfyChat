        "question": "What is the purpose of the AbsSinWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AbsSinWave node generates an absolute sine wave pattern that oscillates between a specified maximum value and zero, influenced by phase, amplitude, and translation parameters. It is designed to provide a versatile waveform for various applications such as signal processing or animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'phase' parameter control in the AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter determines the period of the sine wave, affecting the frequency and overall pattern of the wave. It is crucial for adjusting the timing of oscillations within the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'amplitude' parameter affect the sine wave in AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter sets the height of the sine wave, controlling the magnitude of the oscillations. It is a fundamental parameter for defining the strength of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'x_translation' parameter in AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_translation' parameter shifts the waveform along the x-axis, allowing for horizontal positioning within the waveform pattern. It is important for situating the waveform in a given context."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'max_value' parameter used in the AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_value' parameter establishes the upper limit of the wave, defining the maximum point the sine wave can reach. It is a key parameter for setting the scale of wave oscillations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_frame' parameter represent in AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter represents the current position in time or sequence, which the wave function uses to calculate its output. It is essential for generating the correct waveform at a specific moment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The AbsSinWave node outputs two values: 'output' which provides the calculated value of the absolute sine wave for the current frame, representing the y-coordinate of the waveform, and 'int_output' which is the integer representation of the output, useful for applications requiring discrete values rather than continuous ones."
