        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SDXLAspectRatio node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the dimensions of an image according to a specified aspect ratio, allowing users to select from predefined aspect ratios or input custom dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'swap_dimensions' parameter in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node work?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_dimensions' parameter in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node provides an option to swap the width and height values, offering flexibility in dimension manipulation when the input aspect ratio doesn't align with the intended orientation of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_factor' parameter in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node do?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_factor' parameter in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node is used to increase the size of the image by a specified factor, enhancing the resolution of the image without altering the aspect ratio, which is beneficial for high-quality image outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'batch_size' parameter affect the processing in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter determines the number of images processed in a single operation, which is crucial for optimizing computational resources and improving the efficiency of image processing tasks, especially when dealing with a large volume of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'empty_latent' output in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The 'empty_latent' output in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node serves as a placeholder for latent representations that might be used in more advanced image processing applications, marking the node's capability to integrate with complex workflows, although it is returned as an empty structure in this context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node provides a URL link to the node's documentation page, serving as a useful resource for users seeking more information or help on how to effectively use the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the CR_SDXLAspectRatio node utilize?",
        "answer": "The CR_SDXLAspectRatio node utilizes the CPU as its infra type."
