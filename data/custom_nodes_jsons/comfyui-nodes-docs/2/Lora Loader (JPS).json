        "question": "What is the purpose of the Lora Loader (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader (JPS) node is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to models and/or CLIP components based on specified parameters, allowing for fine-grained control over model outputs without altering the original model architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Lora Loader (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Lora Loader (JPS) node are: model, clip, switch, lora_name, strength_model, and strength_clip."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength_model' parameter control in the Lora Loader (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength_model' parameter determines the strength of the LoRA adjustment applied to the model, allowing for precise control over the influence of the adaptation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'switch' parameter in the Lora Loader (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'switch' parameter controls whether the LoRA adjustment is applied or not, providing a simple mechanism to enable or disable the adaptation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Lora Loader (JPS) node produce?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader (JPS) node outputs two types: the modified model with the LoRA adjustment applied, and the CLIP component with the LoRA adjustment applied (if applicable)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Lora Loader (JPS) node require?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader (JPS) node requires the 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Lora Loader (JPS) node handle the case when both 'strength_model' and 'strength_clip' are set to 0?",
        "answer": "If both 'strength_model' and 'strength_clip' are set to 0, the Lora Loader (JPS) node returns the original model and clip without applying any LoRA adjustments."
