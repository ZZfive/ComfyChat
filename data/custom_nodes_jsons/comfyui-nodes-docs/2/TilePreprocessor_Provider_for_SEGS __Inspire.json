        "question": "What is the purpose of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node provides preprocessing services for SEGS (Semantic Edge Guided Synthesis) by applying a tiling preprocessing technique. It aims to enhance the input data by adjusting the resolution through pyramid upsampling to improve performance in SEGS applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is pyrUp_iters, which specifies the number of iterations for pyramid upsampling. It affects the final resolution of the processed image, with higher iterations resulting in finer resolutions and potentially improved SEGS output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is segs_preprocessor, which returns a preprocessed object ready for SEGS processing. It encapsulates the adjustments made during the tiling preprocessing stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belong to?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belongs to the InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the pyrUp_iters input in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the pyrUp_iters input in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the pyrUp_iters input in the TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the pyrUp_iters input is 1, and the maximum value is 10."
