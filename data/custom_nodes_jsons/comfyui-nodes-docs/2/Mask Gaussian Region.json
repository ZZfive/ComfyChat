        "question": "What does was_mask_gaussian_region do?",
        "answer": "It applies Gaussian blur to the input mask, which helps in reducing visible seams and enhances the visual quality of textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of was_masks_gaussian_region?",
        "answer": "The main goal of was_masks_gaussian_region is to create smoother transitions and reduce visible seams in the final texture output."

    {
        "question": "What is the default value for radius in was_masks_gaussian_region?",
        "answer": "The default value for radius in was_masks_gaussian_region is 5.0."

        "question": "What functionality does DIST kernel implement for labeled images?",
        "answer": "DIST kernel implements parameters for sealling interfaces in labeled lesions and Lie-collapse parameters for Delugh filmmaker models, both of which are useful for visual quality assurance."

    {
        "question": "What does it mean when a node is specified as having stringWithContent=false?",
        "answer": "This indicates that the node should replace the string \"string\" in the console or file output with the actual file string, thus replacing \"string\" with the actual file name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"comfyui`months_before_late=6\" node?",
        "answer": "This node is used to limit the timing by checking if the box is closed more than 6 months ago. It results in the removal of invalid filterdl nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the **output** type for was_masks_gaussian_region?",
        "answer": "The output type is MASKS, representing the processed image mask after applying Gaussian blur."
