        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeConditioningParameters node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningParameters node in ComfyUI encapsulates the logic for adjusting conditioning parameters in search and rescue scenarios, aiming to optimize search strategies based on different scales and scores."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'base_conditioning_scale' parameter in the SeargeConditioningParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_conditioning_scale' parameter is a basic parameter that affects the initial conditions at the start of a search operation. Its Comfy dtype is FLOAT and Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'positive_conditioning_scale' parameter influence the search operation in the SeargeConditioningParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_conditioning_scale' parameter enhances the positive reinforcement aspects of the search, guiding resources towards areas with higher success potential. Its Comfy dtype is FLOAT and Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'negative_aesthetic_score' play in the SeargeConditioningParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_aesthetic_score' reflects the less ideal aspects of the search area, steering the search away from regions that may hinder operational progress. Its Comfy dtype is FLOAT and Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'precondition_mode' parameter affect the search operation in the SeargeConditioningParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'precondition_mode' parameter sets the framework for how conditions are applied at the beginning of a task, determining how search parameters are applied initially. Its Comfy dtype is PRECONDITION_MODES and Python dtype is Enum."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'data' parameter in the SeargeConditioningParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter provides a continuous stream of information that can be used to dynamically adjust search parameters in real-time. It is an optional parameter with Comfy dtype SRG_DATA_STREAM and Python dtype Dict[str, Any]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SeargeConditioningParameters node output?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningParameters node outputs a data stream with updated conditioning parameters, which becomes the basis for ongoing decision-making in search and rescue operations. The output data has Comfy dtype SRG_DATA_STREAM and Python dtype Dict[str, Any]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeConditioningParameters node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningParameters node uses CPU as its infrastructure type."
