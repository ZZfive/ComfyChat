        "question": "What is the purpose of the String Tokenizer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The String Tokenizer node is designed to split a given string into multiple parts based on a specified separator and select one of the parts based on an index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the String Tokenizer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the String Tokenizer node are: text (the main text input to be split), separator (the character or string used to split the text), and selected (the index determining which part of the split text to return)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the String Tokenizer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the String Tokenizer node is 'token', which represents the selected part of the text after splitting it using the specified separator."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the String Tokenizer node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the String Tokenizer node is CPU."

        "question": "What is the default separator used in the String Tokenizer node if no separator is provided?",
        "answer": "If no separator is provided or if the separator is an empty string, the String Tokenizer node uses a space character as the default separator."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the String Tokenizer node handle cases where the selected index is out of range?",
        "answer": "The String Tokenizer node uses the modulo operator (%) to ensure that the selected index is within the valid range of the split text parts. If the selected index is out of range, it will wrap around to the beginning of the parts array."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'selected' input parameter in the String Tokenizer node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'selected' input parameter in the String Tokenizer node is INT, which represents an integer value."
