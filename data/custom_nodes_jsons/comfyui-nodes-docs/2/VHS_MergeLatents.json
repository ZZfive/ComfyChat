        "question": "What is the purpose of the MergeLatents node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MergeLatents node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two sets of latent representations into a single coherent structure. It intelligently applies a specified merge strategy to ensure that the latent dimensions from the two sets match, possibly scaling one set to match the other. The node plays a key role in integrating information from different sources into a unified format that can be further processed or analyzed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MergeLatents node are 'latents_A', 'latents_B', 'merge_strategy', 'scale_method', and 'crop'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents_A' parameter represent in the MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'latents_A' represents the first set of latent representations to be merged. It is crucial as it constitutes half of the input needed for the merge process. The dimensions and characteristics of these latent representations significantly influence the functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'merge_strategy' parameter indicate in the MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'merge_strategy' indicates how the latent representations should be merged. It is crucial for determining the resizing and alignment process that the node will follow in order to combine the latent representations into a harmonious structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the MergeLatents node produce?",
        "answer": "The MergeLatents node produces two output types: 'LATENT' and 'count'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'LATENT' output contain in the MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The output 'LATENT' contains the merged latent representations. It is the primary result of the node's operation and holds significant value for subsequent processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for the MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the MergeLatents node is CPU."
