        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberScaler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberScaler node in ComfyUI is designed to scale a value from a specified range to a new range, effectively normalizing or denormalizing the value based on the provided minimum and maximum boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the NumberScaler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the NumberScaler node are: min, max, scale_to_min, scale_to_max, and value. All of them are of FLOAT Comfy data type and float Python data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the NumberScaler node determine the target scaling range?",
        "answer": "The NumberScaler node determines the target scaling range using the scale_to_min and scale_to_max inputs, which set the lower and upper limits for the output scaled value respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the NumberScaler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the NumberScaler node is a float value that has been adjusted to fit the newly specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the NumberScaler node use?",
        "answer": "The NumberScaler node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the NumberScaler node located in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberScaler node is located in the 'Art Venture/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the source code for the NumberScaler node?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the source code for the NumberScaler node is 'scale_number'."
