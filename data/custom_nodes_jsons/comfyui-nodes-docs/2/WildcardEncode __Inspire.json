        "question": "What is the purpose of the WildcardEncode __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WildcardEncode __Inspire node in ComfyUI is designed to process and enhance text prompts through sophisticated encoding techniques, utilizing external models or custom algorithms. It focuses on improving the quality and specificity of the generated content by applying advanced text processing strategies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WildcardEncode __Inspire node include model, clip, token_normalization, weight_interpretation, wildcard_text, populated_text, mode, Select to add LoRA, Select to add Wildcard, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'token_normalization' parameter affect the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' parameter defines the method of token normalization, which impacts how text input is processed and encoded. It influences the encoding's adaptability to different text lengths and complexities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight_interpretation' parameter determine in the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_interpretation' parameter determines how weights are interpreted during the encoding process, which affects the quality and relevance of the final encoded output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'wildcard_text' parameter in the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'wildcard_text' parameter is the text input that will be encoded. This parameter is central to the node's operation and directly influences the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'populated_text' parameter represent in the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'populated_text' parameter represents the result of populating the wildcard text, which is automatically generated based on the encoding process. It reflects an enhanced version of the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WildcardEncode __Inspire node are model, clip, conditioning, and populated_text."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' parameter influence the WildcardEncode __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter controls whether the text is dynamically populated or fixed, which affects how the wildcard text is processed and encoded."
