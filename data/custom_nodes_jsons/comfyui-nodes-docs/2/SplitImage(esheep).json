        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSplitNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSplitNode is designed to split a batch of images into smaller subsets, facilitating processing by breaking down large image datasets into manageable chunks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageSplitNode enhance workflow?",
        "answer": "The ImageSplitNode enhances workflow by allowing parallel processing, which can improve the efficiency of computational tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImageSplitNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageSplitNode is 'images', which is a set of image data that the node processes. It is crucial for the node's operation as it serves as the main input for the image splitting functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageSplitNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageSplitNode is 'split_images', which consists of multiple image subsets resulting from the image splitting process. These subsets are ready for further processing and can be used for various downstream tasks such as feature extraction or model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the ImageSplitNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the ImageSplitNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageSplitNode handle cases when the number of image chunks is less than the MAX_SIZE?",
        "answer": "If the number of image chunks is less than MAX_SIZE, the ImageSplitNode pads the output with empty images to ensure that the total number of items equals MAX_SIZE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum size of image chunks that the ImageSplitNode can handle?",
        "answer": "The ImageSplitNode can handle a maximum size of 6 image chunks."
