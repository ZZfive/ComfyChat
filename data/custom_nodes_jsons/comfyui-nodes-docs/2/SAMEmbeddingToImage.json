    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The input type required for SAMEmbeddingToImage node is embedding. This parameter represents the SAM embedding that needs to be converted into an image. The embedding is crucial as it contains the encoding information that will be visualized as an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of SAMEmbeddingToImage node is image. It generates an image from the SAM embedding, enabling visualization and further processing of the encoded information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of SAMEmbeddingToImage node is CPU."

        "question": "What are the common nodes SAMEmbeddingToImage node is often used with?",
        "answer": "The common nodes SAMEmbeddingToImage node is often used with are unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SAMEmbeddingToImage node convert an embedding to an image?",
        "answer": "SAMEmbeddingToImage节点将嵌入中包含的复杂信息抽象为更容易理解的图像格式。具体过程包括 flattening the array to a 1D array, converting the 1D array to bytes, converting the bytes to RGBA PIL Image, and returning the image as a tuple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name of SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The function name of SAMEmbeddingToImage node is sam_embedding_to_noise_image."
