        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMHtmlComposer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMHtmlComposer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate HTML content based on given text input, a list of classifiers, and optional extra directions. It utilizes a language model to compose either a complete HTML page document or an HTML snippet, ensuring the output is well-structured and valid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMHtmlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMHtmlComposer node are: llm_model (the language model used for generating HTML content), text_input (the main text input for generating HTML content), and classifier_list (a comma-separated list of classifiers that guide the language model to generate HTML content conforming to specific standards or categories)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs can be provided to the LLMHtmlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The LLMHtmlComposer node accepts two optional inputs: extra_directions (additional instructions to further guide the HTML generation process, allowing for more customized output) and composer_mode (specifies the mode of HTML composition, which can be a complete HTML page document or an HTML snippet, affecting the structure and inclusion of HTML elements in the output)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LLMHtmlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LLMHtmlComposer node is html_output, which represents the generated HTML content. This can be either a complete HTML page or an HTML snippet, based on the input text, classifiers, and optional instructions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Infra type 'GPU' in the LLMHtmlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type 'GPU' in the LLMHtmlComposer node indicates that the node requires a GPU for processing, likely due to the computational demands of the language model used for generating HTML content."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMHtmlComposer node handle the classifier_list input?",
        "answer": "The LLMHtmlComposer node handles the classifier_list input by splitting the comma-separated string into a list of classifiers, which are then used to guide the language model in generating HTML content that conforms to specific standards or categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the composer_mode input in the LLMHtmlComposer node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the composer_mode input in the LLMHtmlComposer node is 'full_markup', which specifies that the generated HTML content should be a complete HTML page document."
