        "question": "What is the purpose of the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images by extracting line art from manga images, converting them into a format suitable for anime-style rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node requires an input image that needs to undergo manga line art extraction processing. This image will be transformed to highlight the line art, making it suitable for anime-style rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node is 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to which the input image needs to be scaled before line art extraction. This parameter ensures that the output can be optimized for the desired visual quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node is an image that has been processed to extract manga line art, presented in a format suitable for anime-style rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node execute the line art extraction process?",
        "answer": "The Manga2Anime_LineArt_Preprocessor node executes the line art extraction process by using the LineartMangaDetector model, which is loaded from pretrained weights. The model is then applied to the input image to extract the line art, and the model is deleted afterwards to free up resources."
