        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioBassBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBassBoost node in ComfyUI is used to enhance the low-frequency components of an audio input by applying a low-pass filter and increasing the gain."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioBassBoost node are: audio (the raw audio data to be processed), cutoff_freq (the cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter), and boost_dB (the amount of gain to be applied to the frequencies below the cutoff frequency)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioBassBoost node is audio, which represents the audio data after the bass boost processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cutoff_freq' parameter in the SaltAudioBassBoost node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff_freq' parameter in the SaltAudioBassBoost node represents the cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter. Frequencies below this value will be enhanced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boost_dB' parameter in the SaltAudioBassBoost node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'boost_dB' parameter in the SaltAudioBassBoost node represents the amount of gain, in decibels, to be applied to the frequency band below the cutoff frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltAudioBassBoost node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioBassBoost node enhance the low frequencies of the audio input?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBassBoost node enhances the low frequencies of the audio input by applying a low-pass filter to the original audio, applying gain to the filtered audio, and then overlaying the gained low-pass filtered audio onto the original audio."
