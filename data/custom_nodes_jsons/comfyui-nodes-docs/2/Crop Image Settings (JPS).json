        "question": "What is the purpose of the Crop Image Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image Settings node in ComfyUI is designed to configure parameters for image cropping, including position, offset, and interpolation method. It abstracts the complexity of image cropping settings, allowing flexible and precise control over the cropping of images and preparation for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Crop Image Settings node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Crop Image Settings node are: source_crop_pos, source_crop_offset, support_crop_pos, support_crop_offset, and crop_intpol."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source_crop_pos input specify?",
        "answer": "The source_crop_pos input specifies the initial position of the source image crop. It affects the starting point of the crop and influences the final composition of the cropped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source_crop_offset input determine?",
        "answer": "The source_crop_offset input determines the offset of the specified position of the source image crop, providing fine control over the cropping position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the support_crop_pos input specify?",
        "answer": "The support_crop_pos input specifies the initial position of the support image crop, similar to 'source_crop_pos', but used for additional images or context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the support_crop_offset input determine?",
        "answer": "The support_crop_offset input determines the offset of the specified position of the support image crop, allowing precise alignment with the source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_intpol input define?",
        "answer": "The crop_intpol input defines the interpolation method used for cropping, affecting the quality and appearance of the cropped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Crop Image Settings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Crop Image Settings node is cropimage_settings, which encapsulates the details of position, offset, and interpolation method for image cropping."
