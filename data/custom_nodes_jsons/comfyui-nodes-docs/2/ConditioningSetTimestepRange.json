        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetTimestepRange node is designed to modify the time range of a conditioning set by applying specified start and end percentages to the conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node are 'conditioning', 'start', and 'end'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conditioning' input represent in the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' input represents the dataset that will be operated on by the node. It is crucial as it determines the node's operations and subsequent modifications to the time range within the conditioning set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' input define in the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' input defines the beginning of the time range to be set within the conditioning data. It is essential for determining where the node will start changing the time range of the conditioning set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end' input represent in the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'end' input represents the endpoint of the time range to be established within the conditioning data. It is crucial for setting the final point at which the node will modify the time range of the conditioning set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node is 'conditioning', which represents the modified conditioning set after applying the specified time range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ConditioningSetTimestepRange node use?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetTimestepRange node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
