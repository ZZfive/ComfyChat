        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToCondList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToCondList node is designed to create a conditional data list from separate condition inputs, simplifying the process of aggregating multiple condition elements into a single organized list for easier manipulation and application in subsequent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter specify in the ToCondList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter specifies the number of individual condition elements to be aggregated into the list, which is crucial for determining the size of the resulting list and influencing the execution and output characteristics of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'inputs_len' parameter is INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'inputs_len' parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ToCondList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToCondList node is a conditional data list, which is aggregated from the individual condition inputs provided to the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output of the ToCondList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output of the ToCondList node is CONDITIONING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of the ToCondList node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of the ToCondList node is List[CONDITIONING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ToCondList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ToCondList node is CPU."
