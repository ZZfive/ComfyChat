        "question": "What is the purpose of the GuidedFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GuidedFilter node in ComfyUI applies a non-linear filtering technique that utilizes a guide image to influence the filtering process, aiming to preserve the structure and edges of the original image while removing noise or smoothing its appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the GuidedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the GuidedFilter node are 'image', which provides the input image data, 'radius', which determines the size of the local neighborhood considered by the filter, and 'eps', which controls the sensitivity of the guided filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'radius' parameter control in the GuidedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter in the GuidedFilter node determines the size of the local neighborhood considered by the filter, influencing the degree to which the filter smooths the image while preserving edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'eps' parameter affect the output of the GuidedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'eps' parameter in the GuidedFilter node controls the sensitivity of the filter. Lower values result in more aggressive smoothing, while higher values preserve more details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'guide' parameter in the GuidedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'guide' parameter in the GuidedFilter node, when provided, serves as a reference image that guides the filtering process, allowing for selective enhancement or suppression of features based on the content of the guide."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GuidedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GuidedFilter node is 'output_image', which is the result of the guided filtering operation and reflects the combination of the input image and the guidance provided by the guide image, if any."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure type does the GuidedFilter node run?",
        "answer": "The GuidedFilter node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
