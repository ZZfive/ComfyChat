        "question": "What is the purpose of the `image_input_switch` method in the WAS_Image_Input_Switch class?",
        "answer": "The `image_input_switch` method is designed to conditionally select between two image inputs based on a boolean flag. It acts as a logic switch in image processing workflows, allowing dynamic routing of image data based on the provided boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node are: image_a (the first image input that will be returned when the boolean flag is true) and image_b (the second image input that will be returned when the boolean flag is false). Both image_a and image_b are of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype PIL.Image.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'boolean' input in the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'boolean' input is a flag that determines which image input is selected. When true, it returns `image_a`; when false, it returns `image_b`. This parameter is crucial to the decision process of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node is 'selected_image', which is determined by the boolean flag. It represents the result of the logic switch operation, providing the selected image based on the input condition. The output is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype PIL.Image.Image."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_Image_Input_Switch node is 'WAS Suite/Logic'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `image_input_switch` method determine which image to return?",
        "answer": "The `image_input_switch` method determines which image to return based on the boolean flag. If the flag is true, it returns `image_a`; if the flag is false, it returns `image_b`."
