        "question": "What is the purpose of the method `set_last_layer` in the CLIPSetLastLayer class?",
        "answer": "The method `set_last_layer` in the CLIPSetLastLayer class is designed to modify the last layer of the CLIP model, allowing customization of the neural network's output layer to adapt the model for different tasks without altering its core architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'clip' parameter in the CLIPSetLastLayer class?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter is essential in the CLIPSetLastLayer class as it represents the CLIP model whose last layer will be modified. It is the primary input that determines the node's operation and subsequent output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'stop_at_clip_layer' parameter specify in the CLIPSetLastLayer class?",
        "answer": "The 'stop_at_clip_layer' parameter in the CLIPSetLastLayer class specifies the index at which the layer hierarchy of the CLIP model should stop, playing a crucial role in determining the final configuration of the model architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CLIPSetLastLayer class after modifying the CLIP model?",
        "answer": "The output of the CLIPSetLastLayer class after modifying the CLIP model is 'modified_clip', which is the CLIP model with its last layer adjusted according to the input parameters, signifying the successful application of the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CLIPSetLastLayer class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CLIPSetLastLayer class is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the CLIPSetLastLayer class belong to?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSetLastLayer class belongs to the 'conditioning' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the `set_last_layer` method in the CLIPSetLastLayer class do?",
        "answer": "The source code of the `set_last_layer` method clones the input CLIP model, modifies its layer hierarchy based on the 'stop_at_clip_layer' parameter, and returns the modified CLIP model."
