        "question": "What is the purpose of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is used to detect and process facial features in images. It focuses on identifying faces and their key points with configurable accuracy and performance settings, suitable for applications that require facial analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is an image, which is the input image that needs to be processed for facial detection and key point annotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_faces' parameter control in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_faces' parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node specifies the maximum number of faces to be detected in an image. This parameter allows controlling the detection process to ensure that the algorithm focuses on a manageable number of faces for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'min_confidence' parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_confidence' parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node determines the minimum confidence level required to consider a face as detected. This threshold helps filter out less accurate detection results, ensuring that only correctly identified faces with high probability are processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node affects the resolution at which the input image is processed. This parameter may impact the detection accuracy and performance of the face mesh preprocessor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is an image, which is an image annotated with the detected facial keypoints. This includes key points and contours of facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth, enabling detailed facial analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type and common nodes for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is 'CPU', and the common nodes are unknown."
