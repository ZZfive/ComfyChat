        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapStretch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapStretch node is used to apply a stretching transformation to an image, adjusting its geometric shape based on the specified x-axis and y-axis power factors, centered around a given point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the power_x parameter control in the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The power_x parameter specifies the power factor for stretching along the x-axis direction. Higher values result in a more pronounced stretching effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the power_y parameter affect the image transformation in RemapStretch?",
        "answer": "The power_y parameter, similar to power_x, controls the stretching extent in the vertical direction (y-axis) of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the center_x parameter determine in the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The center_x parameter determines the horizontal center point of the stretching effect. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, representing the percentage of the image's width."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the center_y parameter specify in the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The center_y parameter specifies the vertical center point of the stretching effect. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, representing the percentage of the image's height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemapStretch node is 'remap', which represents a set of parameters or transformation mappings that define how the image should be stretched based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the RemapStretch node use?",
        "answer": "The RemapStretch node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
