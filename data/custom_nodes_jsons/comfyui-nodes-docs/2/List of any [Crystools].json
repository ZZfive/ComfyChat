        "question": "What is the purpose of the List of any [Crystools] node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The List of any [Crystools] node in ComfyUI is designed to integrate multiple arbitrary types of inputs into a single list, facilitating the processing of various data types within a unified structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'any_i' input represent in the List of any [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The 'any_i' input represents an optional input of any type that will be included in the list. It enhances the node's multifunctionality in data aggregation by allowing a dynamic number of inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the List of any [Crystools] node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the List of any [Crystools] node is 'any_list', which is a list containing all the provided inputs, encapsulating various data types in a unified structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional inputs can the List of any [Crystools] node accept?",
        "answer": "The List of any [Crystools] node can accept up to 8 optional inputs, named from 'any_1' to 'any_8'."
