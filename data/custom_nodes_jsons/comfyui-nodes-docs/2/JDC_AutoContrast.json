        "question": "What is the purpose of the AutoContrast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AutoContrast node in ComfyUI enhances the contrast of an image by stretching its intensity value range across a desired range, improving the visual appeal and clarity of the image without changing its basic features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the AutoContrast node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the AutoContrast node is an input image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image) whose contrast will be adjusted by the node as part of the enhancement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cutoff' parameter control in the AutoContrast node?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff' parameter in the AutoContrast node controls the degree of contrast enhancement applied to the image. Higher values lead to more noticeable changes in contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'min_value' parameter in the AutoContrast node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' parameter in the AutoContrast node sets the minimum value in the image that will not be affected by the contrast adjustment, preserving the details in the shadow areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AutoContrast node?",
        "answer": "The output of the AutoContrast node is an image with increased contrast (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image), suitable for further processing or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the AutoContrast node use?",
        "answer": "The AutoContrast node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AutoContrast node handle the 'min_value' parameter when it is less than 0?",
        "answer": "When the 'min_value' parameter is less than 0, the AutoContrast node applies the autocontrast operation without considering the 'min_value' parameter."
