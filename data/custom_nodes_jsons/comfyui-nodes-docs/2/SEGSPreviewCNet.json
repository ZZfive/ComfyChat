        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSPreviewCNet node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPreviewCNet node is used to process and preview segmentation results. It accepts segmentation data as input and generates a series of preview images, enhancing the visualization and analysis of segmentation work."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SEGSPreviewCNet node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SEGSPreviewCNet node is 'segs', which provides the segmentation data that the node will process. It directly influences the content of the generated preview images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SEGSPreviewCNet node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SEGSPreviewCNet node are 'ui' and 'result'. 'ui' contains the user interface elements, including a list of images representing the segmentation previews. 'result' is the main output, containing the visual representation of the segmentation data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ui' output in the SEGSPreviewCNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' output in the SEGSPreviewCNet node contains the user interface elements, including a list of images representing the segmentation previews. It is crucial for user interaction and visual feedback."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output in the SEGSPreviewCNet node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the SEGSPreviewCNet node is the main output, containing the visual representation of the segmentation data. It is a collection of images processed by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the SEGSPreviewCNet node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the SEGSPreviewCNet node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code of SEGSPreviewCNet, what happens if 'seg.control_net_wrapper.control_image' is None?",
        "answer": "If 'seg.control_net_wrapper.control_image' is None, an empty PIL tensor of size 64x64 is created and used as the 'cnet_image'."
