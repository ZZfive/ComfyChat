        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is designed to pre-process images to extract anime-style line art. It uses a dedicated model to detect and enhance line art features in anime images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is an image that needs anime line art extraction processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input 'resolution' used for in the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' optional input in the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is used to specify the output resolution of the line art image, which affects the detail level and clarity of the extracted line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is an image that has been processed to extract anime-style line art, which can be directly used for subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node execute the line art extraction process?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_AnimeLineArtPreprocessor node executes the line art extraction process by calling the LineartAnimeDetector model, passing the input image and resolution, and returning the processed image."
