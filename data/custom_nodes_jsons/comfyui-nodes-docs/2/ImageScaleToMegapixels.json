        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleToMegapixels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleToMegapixels node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the size of an image to reach a specified number of megapixels. It can both upscale and downscale images to achieve the desired image quality and size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node are 'images', which is the input image that needs to be resized, and 'megapixels', which defines the target size of the image in megapixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node is 'upscale_model_opt', which allows specifying the upscaling model to be used for enlarging the image. This parameter affects the visual effect of the resized image when it needs to be upscaled beyond a certain threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ImageScaleToMegapixels node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageScaleToMegapixels node is the resized image that has been adjusted to fit the specified number of megapixels. It is the direct result of the scaling operation, reflecting changes in size and possibly quality based on the selected upscaling method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImageScaleToMegapixels node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the ImageScaleToMegapixels node belong?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleToMegapixels node belongs to the 'Art Venture/Utils' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'megapixels' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'megapixels' input parameter is 1."
