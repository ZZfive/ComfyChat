        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNodeSetMuteState node is designed to control the mute state of a signal processing node. It allows the user to activate or mute the node based on the provided 'set_state' parameter, thereby affecting the flow of signals in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node are 'signal' (the input signal the node will process), 'node_id' (the unique identifier of the node whose mute state is to be changed), and 'set_state' (which determines whether the node should be set to active or mute state)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'signal' parameter represent in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' parameter represents the input signal that the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node will process. It is a fundamental part of the node's operation as it determines the data that will be affected by the change in mute state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'node_id' parameter in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The 'node_id' parameter specifies the unique identifier of the node whose mute state is to be changed. It is crucial for precisely locating the target node in a network of multiple nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'set_state' parameter in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The 'set_state' parameter determines whether the node should be set to active or mute state. It is a key input as it directly controls the operational state of the node in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node is 'signal_opt', which represents the optionally modified signal after the mute state change. It signifies the result of the node's operation, reflecting whether the signal has been processed or muted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node is CPU."
