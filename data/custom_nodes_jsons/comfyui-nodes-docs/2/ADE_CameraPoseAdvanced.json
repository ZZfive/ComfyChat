        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node is designed to create advanced camera control poses for animations in ComfyUI. It allows combining multiple motion types and intensities to generate complex camera movements, enhancing the dynamic visual narrative in animated sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many motion types can be specified in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node allows specifying up to six motion types, each with their own strength multiplier, to create a comprehensive set of movements for complex camera control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'speed' parameter control in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'speed' parameter in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node controls the speed of the camera movement, influencing how quickly or slowly the camera transitions between poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frame_length' parameter in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_length' parameter in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node determines the number of frames over which the camera movement is applied, defining the duration of the movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional 'prev_poses' input used for in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'prev_poses' input in the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node allows incorporating previous camera poses with new movements to achieve seamless transitions in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node is CAMERACTRL_POSES, representing the generated camera control poses that reflect the combined effect of the specified movements and parameters on the camera's path in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node located within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraPoseAdvanced node is located in the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/CameraCtrl/poses' category within ComfyUI."
