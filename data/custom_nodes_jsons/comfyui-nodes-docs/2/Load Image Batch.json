        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Load_Image_Batch node is designed to efficiently load and manage batches of image files. It provides the capability to load images in different modes such as single image, incremental images, or random selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node are 'path', which specifies the directory path of the image files, and 'pattern', which is used to filter image files based on a specific pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' parameter in the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is an integer that represents the specific position of an image within the batch to be loaded. It plays a crucial role in determining the exact image to be retrieved when the mode is set to 'single_image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines the method of loading images. It can be set to 'single_image' for loading a specific image, 'incremental_image' for sequential access, or 'random' for random selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'allow_RGBA_output' parameter affect the output of the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'allow_RGBA_output' parameter determines whether the output image is allowed to have RGBA channels. If set to 'false', the node converts the image to RGB."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'filename_text_extension' parameter in the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_text_extension' parameter indicates whether to include the file extension in the filename text output. It is useful when the file extension is not needed in the filenames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_Load_Image_Batch node are 'image', which provides the loaded image from the specified batch, and 'filename_text', which returns the name of the loaded image file for reference or further processing."
