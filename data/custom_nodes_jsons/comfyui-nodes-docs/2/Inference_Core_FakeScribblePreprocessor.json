        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images and generate fake scribble line effects. It utilizes an improved HED edge detection model to create stylized line drawings that mimic a scribble effect, providing an alternative to traditional edge detection methods for artistic and creative applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is an image, which is the main data source for the node's execution and determines the final visual output effect. The Comfy data type for the image input is IMAGE, and the Python data type is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs are available for the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node has two optional inputs: 'safe' and 'resolution'. The 'safe' input is a mode selector that enables or disables safety features during image processing, affecting the presentation of the final scribble lines. The 'resolution' input specifies the resolution at which the image processing should be performed, influencing the level of detail in the generated scribble lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is an image with fake scribble lines, presenting a stylized version of the original input. The Comfy data type for the output image is IMAGE, and the Python data type is torch.Tensor."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'safe' input in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' input in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is a mode selector that enables or disables safety features during the image processing, affecting the presentation of the final scribble lines. The default value for this input is 'enable'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' input affect the output of the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the image processing should be performed. It influences the level of detail in the generated scribble lines, with higher resolutions potentially resulting in more detailed line drawings."
