        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy humanSegmentation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy humanSegmentation node in ComfyUI is designed to segment human contours from images. It uses advanced machine learning models to accurately identify and separate the human subject from the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the easy humanSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the easy humanSegmentation node are 'image', 'method', and 'confidence'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' parameter specify in the easy humanSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in the easy humanSegmentation node specifies the segmentation technique or model to be used, which affects the accuracy, performance, and suitability for different types of images or requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'confidence' parameter in the easy humanSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The 'confidence' parameter in the easy humanSegmentation node allows setting a threshold for the segmentation confidence to filter out less certain segments and ensure higher accuracy of the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs are provided by the easy humanSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The easy humanSegmentation node provides two outputs: 'image' which is the segmented image with the human contour separated from the background, and 'mask' which is a binary mask indicating the areas in the image corresponding to the human contour."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy humanSegmentation node handle the 'ui' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' parameter in the easy humanSegmentation node represents the user interface component that displays the segmentation result, providing a visual representation of the human contour separated from the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the easy humanSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with the easy humanSegmentation node are currently listed as 'unknown'."
