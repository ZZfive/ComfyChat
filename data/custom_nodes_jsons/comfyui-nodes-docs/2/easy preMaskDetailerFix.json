        "question": "What is the purpose of the preMaskDetailerFix node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The preMaskDetailerFix node in ComfyUI aims to enhance the detail preservation and editing capabilities in image processing workflows. It focuses on improving the mask application process to ensure precise localization of the intended regions in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The preMaskDetailerFix node requires the following input parameters: 'pipe', 'mask', and 'guide_size'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' parameter carry in the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter carries the state of the entire image processing pipeline, including models, images, and other settings, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the node and continuity of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'guide_size' parameter affect the functioning of the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The 'guide_size' parameter determines the size of the guiding image used to refine the detail fixing process. It influences how the node identifies and processes areas that need attention."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The output of the preMaskDetailerFix node is an updated version of the input pipeline with the detail fix applied and additional settings for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the preMaskDetailerFix node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' parameter in the preMaskDetailerFix node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter defines the region of interest in the image that needs enhancement or modification. It directly affects the node's ability to apply detailed fixes to the target area."
