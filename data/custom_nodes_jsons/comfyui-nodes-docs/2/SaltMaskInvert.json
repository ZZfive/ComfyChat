        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskInvert node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskInvert node is used to invert the pixel values of the mask area, realizing the flipping of the mask foreground and background. This operation is crucial for image processing tasks that need to focus on the reverse part of a given area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SaltMaskInvert node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskInvert node is 'masks', which represents the input mask that needs to be inverted. This parameter is essential as it directly affects the inversion process and determines which areas of the mask will be flipped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskInvert node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskInvert node is 'MASKS', which represents the inverted mask with pixel values opposite to the original input. This output is crucial for subsequent image processing or analysis tasks that require the use of the inverted mask area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskInvert node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskInvert node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskInvert node?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltMaskInvert node is 'SALT/Masking/Filter'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the SaltMaskInvert node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the SaltMaskInvert node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the SaltMaskInvert class?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the SaltMaskInvert class is 'add_masks'."
