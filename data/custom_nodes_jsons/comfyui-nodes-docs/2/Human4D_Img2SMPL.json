        "question": "What does the det_confidence_thresh parameter control in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The det_confidence_thresh parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node controls the confidence threshold for human body detection. It helps filter out detection results with low confidence, ensuring that only high-confidence human body images are processed into 3D models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the det_iou_thresh parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The det_iou_thresh parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node represents the Intersection over Union (IOU) threshold for human body detection. It is used to manage the overlap between detected bounding boxes, improving the accuracy of human body detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the det_batch_size parameter affect in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The det_batch_size parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node affects the batch size for processing detections. It influences the throughput and efficiency of the human body detection process, balancing speed and memory usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the hmr_batch_size parameter determine in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The hmr_batch_size parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node determines the batch size for the Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) process. It decides how many human body images are simultaneously processed for 3D modeling, affecting the node's performance and resource utilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Human4D_Img2SMPL node is a comprehensive 3D representation of multiple human subjects derived from 2D images, including mesh models, pose information, and additional metadata for advanced motion analysis."
