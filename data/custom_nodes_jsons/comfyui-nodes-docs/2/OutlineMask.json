        "question": "What is the purpose of the OutlineMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OutlineMask node in ComfyUI is designed to manipulate image masks by applying a dilation or erosion process to create an outline effect. It enhances the visual distinctiveness of the mask edges, which is crucial for applications that require clear and well-defined mask boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the OutlineMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the OutlineMask node are 'mask', 'outline_width', and 'tapered_corners'. 'mask' represents the original image mask to be processed, 'outline_width' specifies the extent of outline expansion or contraction to be applied, and 'tapered_corners' applies a tapered effect to the mask's corners when set to true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'outline_width' parameter control in the OutlineMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'outline_width' parameter in the OutlineMask node controls the degree of outline expansion or contraction applied to the mask. It is a key factor in determining the thickness of the generated outline, thus influencing the visual impact of the mask edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the 'tapered_corners' parameter to true in the OutlineMask node?",
        "answer": "When the 'tapered_corners' parameter is set to true in the OutlineMask node, it applies a tapered effect to the corners of the mask, creating a more refined and visually appealing outline. This feature enhances the aesthetic quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the OutlineMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the OutlineMask node is the processed image mask with the applied outline effect. It represents the final product of the node's operation, ready for further use or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the OutlineMask node run on?",
        "answer": "The OutlineMask node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'run' function in the OutlineMask node's source code do?",
        "answer": "The 'run' function in the OutlineMask node's source code takes the input parameters 'mask', 'outline_width', and 'tapered_corners', applies the dilation or erosion process to create the outline effect, and returns the processed image mask."
