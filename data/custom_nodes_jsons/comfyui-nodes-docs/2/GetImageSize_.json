        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetImageSize_ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize_ node is designed to extract and optionally adjust the dimensions of an image to ensure it meets a minimum width requirement. It processes the image while maintaining its aspect ratio and returns both the original and adjusted dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the GetImageSize_ node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the GetImageSize_ node is the 'image' parameter, which is the main input for the node's operations. It is the source from which the node retrieves width and height information and potentially resizes it to meet specified minimum width standards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min_width' parameter in the GetImageSize_ node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'min_width' parameter in the GetImageSize_ node sets the minimum width requirement for the image. If the image's width is less than this value, the node will resize the image to meet this standard, ensuring a consistent starting point for further image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the GetImageSize_ node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the GetImageSize_ node include 'width', 'height', 'min_width', and 'min_height'. These outputs provide essential information about the image's original and adjusted dimensions, crucial for maintaining image integrity during processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' output in the GetImageSize_ node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output in the GetImageSize_ node represents the original width of the input image. This foundational information about the image's dimensions is crucial for any subsequent image operations or analyses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'min_height' output in the GetImageSize_ node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'min_height' output in the GetImageSize_ node indicates the height of the image after it has been resized to meet the minimum width standard. This output is important for understanding how the image has been adjusted and ensuring its proper display or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the GetImageSize_ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the GetImageSize_ node is CPU."
