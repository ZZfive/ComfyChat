        "question": "What is the purpose of the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is used to extract stylized line drawings from images, combining scribble detection and XDoG (Extended Difference of Gaussians) filtering techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is an image, which is the main data on which the node applies scribble detection and XDoG filtering techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter control in the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter decides the sensitivity of the XDoG filter when detecting edges. Lower values capture more subtle details, while higher values emphasize more prominent edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter specifies the resolution of the processed image, influencing the level of detail captured in the extracted lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is a processed image containing stylized line drawings that emphasize edges and details extracted using the Scribble_XDoG technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used in conjunction with the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes used with the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node include PreviewImage and CR Multi-ControlNet Stack."
