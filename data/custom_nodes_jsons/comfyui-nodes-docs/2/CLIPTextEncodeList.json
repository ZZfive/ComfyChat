        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeSequence node is designed to encode a sequence of lines of text into a set of conditioning sequences that can be used for further processing in neural networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node are 'clip', 'token_normalization', 'weight_interpretation', and 'text'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'token_normalization' parameter affect the encoding process in the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' parameter determines how tokens in the text are normalized before encoding. It plays a key role in ensuring that the encoded text maintains a consistent scale, which is crucial for subsequent neural network operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'weight_interpretation' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_interpretation' parameter defines the method of interpreting weights associated with text tokens during the encoding process. It influences the quality and characteristics of the generated encoded sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node is 'conditioning_sequence', which is a sequence of encoded lines of text, with each line represented as a pair of an index and an encoded vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIPTextEncodeSequence node handle multiline text input?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeSequence node processes multiline text input by splitting it into lines and encoding each line separately. It also extracts an index from each line, which is used along with the encoded vector to form the conditioning sequence."
