        "question": "What is the purpose of the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode class in ComfyUI is designed to operate and introduce noise into the system in a weighted manner. It is a crucial component in the animation process that allows for fine-tuning of noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the batch_offset parameter in the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The batch_offset parameter is crucial for managing the processing order of noise layers. It influences the overall structure and organization of noise layers in the animation, ensuring each layer is correctly positioned in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the balance_multiplier parameter contribute to the function of the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The balance_multiplier parameter is used to fine-tune the balance between existing noise and newly added noise. It ensures that the overall noise effect is harmonious and integrates well into the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the noise_weight parameter in the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The noise_weight parameter adjusts the intensity of the noise added to the animation. It is a key factor in achieving the desired visual effect and ensures that the noise is balanced with the fundamental elements of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The output of the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode is a modified group of noise layers that includes the newly added weighted noise layer. This output is important as it forms the basis for further processing and development of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the prev_noise_layers parameter in the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The prev_noise_layers parameter is an optional group of previously generated noise layers. It allows for continuity and building upon the existing noise structure, maintaining consistency and coherence in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the mask_optional parameter in the NoiseLayerAddWeightedNode?",
        "answer": "The mask_optional parameter is an optional tensor that can be used to selectively apply noise to specific areas of the animation. It provides control over the most prominent locations of the noise effect."
