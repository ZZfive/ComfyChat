        "question": "What is the purpose of the SUPIR_first_stage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_first_stage node is designed to perform initial processing on images using the SUPIR model, with the aim of fixing compression artifacts and noise, which usually results in slightly blurred images."

    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the 'image' parameter in the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The input type for the 'image' parameter in the SUPIR_first_stage node is IMAGE in ComfyUI, and the corresponding Python data type is object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_tiled_vae' parameter in the SUPIR_first_stage node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'use_tiled_vae' parameter in the SUPIR_first_stage node indicates whether to use a tiled approach for VAE processing, which affects performance and results."

        "question": "What is the output type of the 'denoised_image' in the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'denoised_image' in the SUPIR_first_stage node is IMAGE in ComfyUI, and the corresponding Python data type is object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'denoised_latents' output in the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The 'denoised_latents' output in the SUPIR_first_stage node represents the latent representation of the denoised image, suitable for further processing steps."
