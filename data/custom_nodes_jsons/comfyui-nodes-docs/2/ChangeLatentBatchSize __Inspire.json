        "question": "What is the purpose of the ChangeLatentBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChangeLatentBatchSize node is designed to modify the batch size of a given latent representation. It achieves this by adjusting the tensor associated with the latent samples based on the specified new batch size and mode, ensuring the structure of the latent representation is maintained while adapting to the new batch size requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ChangeLatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ChangeLatentBatchSize node are 'latent', which is the latent representation to be resized, 'batch_size', which specifies the target batch size for the latent representation, and 'mode', which determines the method of resizing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter specify in the ChangeLatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter in the ChangeLatentBatchSize node specifies the target batch size for the latent representation, directly influencing the resizing operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter determine in the ChangeLatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the ChangeLatentBatchSize node determines the method of resizing, providing flexibility in how the batch size adjustment is executed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ChangeLatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ChangeLatentBatchSize node is 'latent', which is the resized latent representation that now conforms to the specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ChangeLatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ChangeLatentBatchSize node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChangeLatentBatchSize node modify the batch size of the latent representation?",
        "answer": "The ChangeLatentBatchSize node modifies the batch size of the latent representation by copying the input latent representation, adjusting the tensor associated with the latent samples based on the specified new batch size and mode, and then updating the latent representation with the resized samples."
