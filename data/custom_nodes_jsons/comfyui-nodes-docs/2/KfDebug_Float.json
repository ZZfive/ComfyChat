        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Float node is designed to facilitate the debugging process by providing a way to inspect and analyze floating-point numbers in the data processing pipeline. It is a key tool for developers to verify the integrity and behavior of numerical data at various stages of computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter for the KfDebug_Float node?",
        "answer": "The input parameter for the KfDebug_Float node is 'input_float'. It is crucial for the node's operation as it represents the floating-point number that needs to be debugged. It plays a core role in the execution of the node and is the main data to be checked and analyzed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data type does the 'input_float' parameter expect?",
        "answer": "The 'input_float' parameter expects a Comfy data type of FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type corresponds to the 'input_float' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'input_float' parameter corresponds to the Python data type of float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output parameter for the KfDebug_Float node?",
        "answer": "The output parameter for the KfDebug_Float node is 'output_float'. It is very important as it represents the debugged floating-point number processed by the node. It is crucial for downstream processes as it ensures the continuity and reliability of the data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data type does the 'output_float' parameter return?",
        "answer": "The 'output_float' parameter returns a Comfy data type of FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the KfDebug_Float node?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Float node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
