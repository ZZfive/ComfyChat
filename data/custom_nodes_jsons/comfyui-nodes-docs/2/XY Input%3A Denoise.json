        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: Denoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Denoise node in ComfyUI is used to generate a set of floating-point values representing denoise levels for data batch processing. It abstracts the process of calculating denoise values within a specified range, helping to visualize or analyze denoise effects in a computational efficiency context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the XY Input: Denoise node are: batch_count (INT), first_denoise (FLOAT), and last_denoise (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the batch_count input specify in the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "In the XY Input: Denoise node, the batch_count input specifies the number of denoise values to be generated, allowing control over the granularity of denoise analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the first_denoise input define in the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "In the XY Input: Denoise node, the first_denoise input defines the starting point of the denoise range, allowing customization of the lower limit of the denoise process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the last_denoise input set in the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "In the XY Input: Denoise node, the last_denoise input sets the end point of the denoise range, allowing adjustment of the upper limit of the denoise analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the XY Input: Denoise node is X or Y, which outputs a tuple containing the value type ('Denoise') and the generated floating-point denoise values, suitable for plotting or further analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the XY Input: Denoise node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the XY Input: Denoise node is CPU."
