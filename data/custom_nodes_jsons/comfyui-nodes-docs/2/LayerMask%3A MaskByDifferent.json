        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskByDifferent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskByDifferent node in ComfyUI calculates the differences between two input images and outputs the result as a mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskByDifferent node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MaskByDifferent node are: image_1 (first input image), image_2 (second input image), gain (difference gain), fix_gap (gap correction), fix_threshold (correction threshold), and main_subject_detect (enable main subject detection)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does increasing the 'gain' value do in the MaskByDifferent node?",
        "answer": "Increasing the 'gain' value in the MaskByDifferent node makes subtle differences between the two input images more pronounced in the output mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'main_subject_detect' input in the MaskByDifferent node?",
        "answer": "Setting 'main_subject_detect' to True enables main subject detection in the MaskByDifferent node, which ignores differences outside the main subject area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MaskByDifferent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MaskByDifferent node is a mask (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MaskByDifferent node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MaskByDifferent node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the MaskByDifferent node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskByDifferent node is classified under the 'ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerMask' category in ComfyUI."
