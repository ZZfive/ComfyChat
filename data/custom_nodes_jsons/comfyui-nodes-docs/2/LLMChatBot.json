    {
        "question": "What output types does the LLMChatBot node generate?",
        "answer": "The LLMChatBot node generates the following output types: chat_history (the accumulated dialogue history between the user and the chatbot), response (the chatbot's direct response to the user's latest prompt), and chat_token_count (the total number of tokens used in the chat session, reflecting the complexity and length of the conversation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMChatBot node handle cases where the conversation exceeds the maximum number of tokens?",
        "answer": "If the conversation exceeds the maximum number of tokens, the LLMChatBot node prunes messages from the history. It removes tokens from the beginning of each message if possible, or removes entire messages if necessary, until the total token count is within the specified limit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'user_nickname' and 'system_nickname' inputs in the LLMChatBot node?",

    },
    {
        "question": "How is the chat history structured in the output of the LLMChatBot node?",
        "answer": "The chat history in the output of the LLMChatBot node is structured as a string that includes the user's prompts and the chatbot's responses, along with their respective nicknames. Each exchange is formatted with the nickname followed by the corresponding message."
