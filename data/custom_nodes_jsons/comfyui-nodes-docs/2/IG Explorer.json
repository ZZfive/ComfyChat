        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Explorer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Explorer node in ComfyUI is designed to navigate and analyze latent space, helping users explore and manipulate parameters to generate or modify content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IG Explorer node are 'folder' (STRING) and 'precision' (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'precision' input determine in the IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "The 'precision' input in the IG Explorer node decides the level of detail or accuracy during the exploration process, affecting how finely the node examines the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the IG Explorer node are 'float' (FLOAT) and 'string' (STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'image_filename' function in the IG Explorer node format the parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'image_filename' function in the IG Explorer node formats the parameter to have six digits before the decimal and six digits after, using the format {:02d}_{:024d}."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'process_jobs' function in the IG Explorer node do?",
        "answer": "The 'process_jobs' function in the IG Explorer node processes a queue of jobs, generates images if necessary, measures differences between parameters, and returns the parameter with the minimum similarity for further exploration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when no eligible jobs are found in the 'process_jobs' function of the IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "When no eligible jobs are found in the 'process_jobs' function of the IG Explorer node, it returns -1."
