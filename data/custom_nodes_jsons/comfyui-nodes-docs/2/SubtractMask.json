        "question": "What is the purpose of the SubtractMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node in ComfyUI is used to perform a subtraction operation on two mask images, providing a resulting mask that represents the difference between the inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node requires two input masks: 'mask1' and 'mask2', both of which are of the Comfy dtype 'MASK' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask1' input represent in the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "In the SubtractMask node, 'mask1' represents the first mask used in the subtraction operation. It plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the resulting mask, as it defines the initial state of the mask from which the second mask will be subtracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask2' input represent in the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "In the SubtractMask node, 'mask2' represents the second mask that will be subtracted from the first mask. Its importance lies in modifying the content of the first mask, thus producing the final mask that reflects the subtraction effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SubtractMask node is a single mask, which is the result of the subtraction operation between the two input masks. It is of the Comfy dtype 'MASK' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output mask of the SubtractMask node represent?",
        "answer": "The output mask of the SubtractMask node represents the remaining area after subtracting the second mask from the first mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SubtractMask node is CPU."
