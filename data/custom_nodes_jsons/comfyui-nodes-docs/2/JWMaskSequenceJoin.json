        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWMaskSequenceJoin node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceJoin node is designed to merge two mask sequences into a single connected mask sequence by concatenating the input mask sequences along a specified dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the JWMaskSequenceJoin node?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceJoin node requires an input type of mask_sequence_i, which is the mask sequence to be merged with another mask sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype does the mask_sequence_i input parameter have?",
        "answer": "The mask_sequence_i input parameter has the Comfy dtype of MASK_SEQUENCE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWMaskSequenceJoin node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWMaskSequenceJoin node is mask_sequence, which is the result of concatenating two input mask sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the output mask_sequence from JWMaskSequenceJoin be used for?",
        "answer": "The output mask_sequence from JWMaskSequenceJoin can be used for subsequent mask operations that require a combined view of the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the JWMaskSequenceJoin node use?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceJoin node uses the GPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceFromMask node is used to create a mask sequence from a single mask by reshaping the mask and repeating it based on the specified batch size."
