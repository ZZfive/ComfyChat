        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberUnaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberUnaryOperation node is designed to perform various unary operations on numeric inputs. It accepts a single operation identifier and a number, applies the corresponding mathematical function to generate a result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the NumberUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the NumberUnaryOperation node are 'op', which is a string specifying the unary operation to be performed, and 'a', which represents the numeric value to which the unary operation will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in the NumberUnaryOperation node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the NumberUnaryOperation node is a string that specifies the unary operation to be executed. It is crucial for determining the mathematical function to be applied to the input number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' parameter in the NumberUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the NumberUnaryOperation node represents the numeric value to which the unary operation will be applied. It is an essential component of the node's functionality as the result of the operation depends on this input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the NumberUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the NumberUnaryOperation node is 'result', which represents the final numeric value obtained after applying the unary operation to the input number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the NumberUnaryOperation node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the NumberUnaryOperation node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the NumberUnaryOperation node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the NumberUnaryOperation node defines the input types, return types, function, category, and the operation to be performed on the input number using the specified unary operation."
