        "question": "What is the purpose of the FromListGetMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGetMasks node is designed to retrieve specific masks from a given list of masks in ComfyUI. It supports random access of list elements and allows both forward and reverse indexing for flexible manipulation and selection of masks within the list."

    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the FromListGetMasks node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FromListGetMasks node is 'list', which specifies the source list of masks from which a specific mask will be retrieved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the input 'list' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input 'list' parameter is MASK."

    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the input 'list' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the input 'list' parameter is List[torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FromListGetMasks node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FromListGetMasks node is 'mask', which represents the mask retrieved from the specified index in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the output 'mask'?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the output 'mask' is MASK."
