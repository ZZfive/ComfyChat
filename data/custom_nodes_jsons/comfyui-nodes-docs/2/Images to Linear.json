    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'images' input parameter in the WAS_Images_To_Linear node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter is essential for the operation of the WAS_Images_To_Linear node as it serves as the input for the image to linear conversion process, directly influencing the execution of the node by determining the source of the images to be converted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'linear_images' output parameter in the WAS_Images_To_Linear node?",
        "answer": "The 'linear_images' output parameter represents the result of the image to linear conversion, providing prepared image data for further linear analysis or operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Images_To_Linear node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Images_To_Linear node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the WAS_Images_To_Linear node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the WAS_Images_To_Linear node defines the class and methods for converting images to a linear format, including input and output types, category, and the function for performing the conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Images_To_Linear node handle multiple images in the conversion process?",
        "answer": "For multiple images, the WAS_Images_To_Linear node converts each image to a tensor, concatenates these tensors, and returns a single tensor as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Images_To_Linear node handle a single image in the conversion process?",
        "answer": "For a single image, the WAS_Images_To_Linear node converts the image to a linear format using the pil2tensor and tensor2pil functions, and returns the converted tensor."
