        "question": "What is the purpose of the Color (RGB) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color (RGB) node in ComfyUI is designed to create a color representation by specifying individual red, green, and blue (RGB) components. It allows users to define each color component to form a composite color that can be used for various image processing and color manipulation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "The Color (RGB) node requires three inputs: 'r' for the red component, 'g' for the green component, and 'b' for the blue component. Each of these inputs is an integer value that defines the intensity of the respective color in the final composite color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Color (RGB) node is a composite color made up of the specified red, green, and blue components. This output is crucial for subsequent image processing or color manipulation tasks, providing a standardized color format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' specified for the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' specified for the Color (RGB) node is 'CPU', indicating that this node is designed to run on CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "The category of the Color (RGB) node is 'Bmad/image', indicating that it belongs to the image processing category within the Bmad framework in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the input types defined in the source code of the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the Color (RGB) node, the input types are defined using the `INPUT_TYPES` class method, which returns a dictionary specifying the required inputs 'r', 'g', and 'b', each being of type `color255_INPUT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output type defined in the source code of the Color (RGB) node?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the Color (RGB) node, the output type is defined using the `RETURN_TYPES` attribute, which is set to (`'COLOR'`,), indicating that the node outputs a color value."
