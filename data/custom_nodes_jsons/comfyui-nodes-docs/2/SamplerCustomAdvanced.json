    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the noise parameter in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The noise parameter is crucial for the sampling process as it introduces randomness in the latent space, enabling the generation of diverse outputs. It plays an important role in determining the quality and variety of the sampled images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the guider parameter contribute to the sampling process in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The guider parameter is essential for guiding the sampling process towards desired results. It helps refine the latent representation by providing guidance based on specific criteria or goals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the sampler parameter play in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The sampler parameter determines the sampling strategy used by the node. It is a key factor in the efficiency and effectiveness of the sampling process, influencing the node's ability to generate high-fidelity latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the sigmas parameter in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The sigmas parameter represents the noise levels or scales used in the sampling process. It is important for controlling the amount of noise and detail in the generated images, thus affecting the overall quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the latent_image parameter in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The latent_image parameter serves as the input to the sampling process, representing the initial state of the latent representation. It forms the basis for the node's operations as it is the foundation for generating the final sampled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the denoised_output parameter in the SamplerCustomAdvanced node provide?",
        "answer": "The denoised_output parameter provides a version of the sampled latent image that has undergone denoising processing. This output is particularly useful for applications where noise reduction is a priority."
