        "question": "What is the purpose of the crop_dominant_region method in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The crop_dominant_region method is designed to process input masks and intelligently crop the dominant region within each mask. This is particularly useful for focusing on the most important parts of an image, which is beneficial for applications such as image summarization, object recognition, and content-aware image resizing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'masks' input parameter in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter is crucial for the operation of the node as it defines the regions of interest within the image. It directly influences the output of the node, determining which parts of the image will be retained after the cropping process. The masks should be provided as tensors to ensure compatibility with the node's internal processing mechanisms."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'padding' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The 'padding' parameter is used to specify the amount of space to be preserved around the dominant region after cropping. It is essential for preventing the cropped region from being too close to the edges of the image, which can lead to more pleasing results. The default value is set to 24, which reasonably balances the focus on the dominant region and the preservation of the image context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'MASKS' represent in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'MASKS' represents the generated masks after the dominant region cropping process. It is a tensor containing the cropped regions of interest, which can be used for further image processing or analysis. The importance of this output lies in its ability to provide a focused subset of the original image, potentially improving the efficiency of subsequent operations."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the crop_dominant_region method in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the crop_dominant_region method is a tuple containing a tensor representing the cropped dominant regions of the input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Mask_Crop_Dominant_Region class handle input masks with different dimensions?",
        "answer": "If the input masks have more than 3 dimensions, the class processes each mask individually, crops the dominant region, and concatenates the results into a single tensor. If the input mask has 3 or fewer dimensions, it is processed directly, and the cropped dominant region is returned as a tensor."
