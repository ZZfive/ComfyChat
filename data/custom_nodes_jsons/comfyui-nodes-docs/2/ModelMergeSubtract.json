        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the ModelSubtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the ModelSubtract node in ComfyUI is to merge two models by subtracting key patches from one model using a specified multiplier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two required input parameters for the ModelSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The two required input parameters for the ModelSubtract node are 'model1' and 'model2', both of which are of the Comfy dtype 'MODEL'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'multiplier' parameter play in the ModelSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' parameter in the ModelSubtract node adjusts the strength of the patches subtracted from 'model1'. It allows for fine-tuning the influence of 'model2' on the merged model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ModelSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ModelSubtract node is 'merged_model', which represents the result of the model merging process. It encapsulates the combined features of the two input models, providing a new model with adjusted properties."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ModelSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ModelSubtract node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the ModelSubtract node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ModelSubtract node is classified in the 'advanced/model_merging' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ModelSubtract node work with the 'MODEL' Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ModelSubtract node works with the 'MODEL' Comfy dtype for both input and output."
