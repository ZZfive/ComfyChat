        "question": "What is the purpose of the Superprompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Superprompt node in ComfyUI uses a T5 model fine-tuned on the SuperPrompt dataset to enhance text prompts by generating more detailed descriptions, aiming to improve the performance of text-to-image models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Superprompt node are: instruction_prompt (STRING), prompt (STRING), and max_new_tokens (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the instruction_prompt input type do in the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The instruction_prompt input type in the Superprompt node is used to guide the expansion of the prompt by setting the context for how the prompt should be elaborated in more detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the max_new_tokens input type affect the output of the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The max_new_tokens input type specifies the maximum number of new tokens to be generated, which controls the length of the expanded prompt, allowing users to adjust the level of detail and complexity of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Superprompt node is a STRING, which is an enhanced version of the original text prompt containing more details and descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the enhanced prompt generated by the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The enhanced prompt generated by the Superprompt node is intended to provide richer context for text-to-image models, potentially leading to more accurate or creative image results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model does the Superprompt node use for generating detailed descriptions?",
        "answer": "The Superprompt node uses a T5 model fine-tuned on the SuperPrompt dataset for generating detailed descriptions from text prompts."
