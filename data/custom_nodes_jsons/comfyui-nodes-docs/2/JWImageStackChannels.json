        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageStackChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the JWImageStackChannels node is to stack two image tensors along their channel dimension, effectively combining them into a single tensor that retains the information from both input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageStackChannels node are 'image_a' and 'image_b', both of which are image tensors. 'image_a' is the first image tensor to be stacked, and 'image_b' is the second image tensor to be stacked with the first one."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageStackChannels node is a single image tensor, which is the result of stacking the two input image tensors along the channel dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWImageStackChannels node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWImageStackChannels node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWImageStackChannels node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWImageStackChannels node is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the JWImageStackChannels node stack the two input image tensors?",
        "answer": "The JWImageStackChannels node stacks the two input image tensors using the torch.cat() function in the PyTorch library, with the dim parameter set to 3 to stack along the channel dimension."
