        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateFluidMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFluidMask node is designed to generate fluid animation effects that can be used to create dynamic and visually appealing mask overlays."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frames' parameter determine in the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter determines the total number of frames to be generated for the fluid mask animation. It is crucial as it defines the length of the animation sequence and influences the overall visual narrative through fluid motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' parameter affect the output of the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter sets the width of the generated fluid mask in pixels. It is an important parameter as it defines the spatial resolution along the x-axis, affecting the detail and quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'height' parameter in the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' parameter specifies the height of the generated fluid mask in pixels. It plays a significant role in establishing the vertical resolution of the output, affecting the level of detail visible in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter do in the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter allows for the inversion of the generated mask. When set to True, it inverts the mask, creating a contrast effect for the same visual result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inflow_count' parameter control in the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'inflow_count' parameter determines the number of inflow points to consider in the fluid simulation. It influences the complexity and distribution of fluid flow, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The CreateFluidMask node outputs two sequences: 'IMAGE' and 'MASK'. The 'IMAGE' output provides a sequence of images generated by the fluid simulation, with each image representing a frame in the animation. The 'MASK' output consists of binary masks corresponding to each frame in the 'IMAGE' output, depicting the areas where the fluid is present."
