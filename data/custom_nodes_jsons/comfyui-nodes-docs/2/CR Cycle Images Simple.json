        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_CycleImagesSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_CycleImagesSimple node in ComfyUI is designed to create an animation effect by cycling through a list of images either sequentially or randomly. It allows specifying frame intervals, loop counts, and the current frame to control the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_CycleImagesSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_CycleImagesSimple node are 'mode' (to determine the order of image cycling), 'frame_interval' (to specify the number of frames between each image change), 'loops' (to set the number of times the animation repeats), and 'current_frame' (to indicate the starting point of the animation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node determines the order in which the images are cycled. It can be set to 'Sequential' for cycling images in a specific order, with potential support for a random mode in future updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'frame_interval' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node specifies the number of frames between each image change in the animation. It affects the speed of the image cycling and is crucial for properly controlling the animation pacing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node affect the animation?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node sets the number of times the animation repeats. It is important for defining the duration of the animation sequence and can be used to create continuous or finite animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'current_frame' parameter play in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_CycleImagesSimple node indicates the starting point of the animation. It is crucial for synchronizing the animation with other elements or for setting a specific point in the animation sequence to begin."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the CR_CycleImagesSimple node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the CR_CycleImagesSimple node include 'image_1' (the first image that can be included in the animation loop) and 'image_list_simple' (a list of images that can be included in the animation loop). These parameters provide flexibility when adding multiple images to the sequence and enhance the overall animation effect."
