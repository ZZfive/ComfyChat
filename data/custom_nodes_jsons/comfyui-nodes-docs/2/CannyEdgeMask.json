        "question": "What is the purpose of the CannyEdgeMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CannyEdgeMask node in ComfyUI applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to an input image to generate a binary edge mask that highlights the edges in the image based on specified thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CannyEdgeMask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CannyEdgeMask node are: the input image to apply Canny edge detection, a lower threshold parameter, and an upper threshold parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the lower and upper threshold parameters affect the edge detection in the CannyEdgeMask node?",
        "answer": "The lower and upper threshold parameters work together to determine which edges are strong enough to be included in the final edge mask. The lower threshold controls the sensitivity of edge detection, while the upper threshold helps refine the edges by only including those that reach or exceed its value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CannyEdgeMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CannyEdgeMask node is a binary edge mask representing the edges detected by the Canny algorithm, which is important for further image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CannyEdgeMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CannyEdgeMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for the CannyEdgeMask node's source code?",
        "answer": "The source code for the CannyEdgeMask node is written in Python."
