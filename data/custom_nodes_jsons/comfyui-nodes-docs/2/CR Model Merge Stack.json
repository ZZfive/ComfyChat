        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_ModelMergeStack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModelMergeStack node is designed to merge multiple model checkpoints into a single unified stack, allowing users to switch between including each checkpoint and adjust the contribution ratios of model and clip components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the switch_1 parameter control in the CR_ModelMergeStack node?",
        "answer": "The switch_1 parameter determines whether the first checkpoint is included in the model stack, playing a key role in the node's operation by enabling or disabling the integration of specific checkpoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the model_ratio1 parameter affect the merged model stack in the CR_ModelMergeStack node?",
        "answer": "The model_ratio1 parameter adjusts the contribution weight of the first checkpoint's model component in the merged stack, which is important for fine-tuning the influence of each model in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the clip_ratio2 parameter in the CR_ModelMergeStack node?",
        "answer": "The clip_ratio2 parameter sets the contribution weight of the second checkpoint's clip component, which is important for balancing the overall impact of clip guidance in the merged model stack."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional model_stack parameter allow users to provide in the CR_ModelMergeStack node?",
        "answer": "The optional model_stack parameter allows users to provide an initial list of models to merge, which is useful for building upon an existing model stack."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MODEL_STACK in the CR_ModelMergeStack node?",
        "answer": "The MODEL_STACK output contains a list of merged model checkpoints with their respective ratios, representing the merged model stack as the main result of the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where does the show_help output in the CR_ModelMergeStack node direct users for more information?",
        "answer": "The show_help output provides a URL link to documentation for additional help, guiding users to an external resource for more information about the node's functionality."
