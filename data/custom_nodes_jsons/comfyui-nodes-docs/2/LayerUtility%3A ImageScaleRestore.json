        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleByAspectRatio custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatio custom node in ComfyUI is used to scale an image or mask according to a specified aspect ratio. It provides options to round the scaled dimensions to multiples of 8 or 16 and to scale based on the longest side."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node are: aspect_ratio, proportional_width, proportional_height, fit, method, round_to_multiple, scale_to_longest_side, and longest_side."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fit' parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node control?",
        "answer": "The 'fit' parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node controls the scaling mode for the aspect ratio. It has three options: 'letterbox' which preserves the entire frame and fills the empty space with black, 'crop' which preserves the shorter side and crops the excess on the longer side, and 'fill' which does not maintain the aspect ratio and fills the width and height independently."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node are 'image' which is a torch.Tensor representing the input image, and 'mask' which is a torch.Tensor representing the input mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types returned by the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatio node returns the following output types: 'image' (the scaled image), 'mask' (the scaled mask), 'original_size' (the original dimensions), 'width' (the target width), and 'height' (the target height)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is the ImageScaleByAspectRatio node implemented in?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatio node is implemented in Python."
