    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the BooleanOperator class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BooleanOperator class are 'a' and 'b'. Both 'a' and 'b' are allowed to take boolean values, integers, and floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported operations in the BooleanOperator class?",
        "answer": "The BooleanOperator class supports the following operations: ==, !=, and, or, xor, not(a), min, and max."

        "question": "What are the usage tips for the BooleanOperator class?",
        "answer": "The BooleanOperator class is designed to be used on a CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the operations supported by the BooleanOperator class and their corresponding results?",
        "answer": "==: Returns True if a equals b\n!=: Returns True if a does not equal b\nand: Returns True if both a and b are True\nor: Returns True if either a or b is True\nxor: Returns True if a does not equal b\nnot(a): Returns the opposite of a\nmin: Returns the larger value among a and b\nmax: Returns the smaller value among a and b"
