        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is designed to directly calculate the image generation resolution from an input image in ComfyUI. It extracts the width and height of the input image and returns these dimensions as the expected image generation resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node requires one input type: an image. This input image is used to determine the output resolution based on its dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the input image in the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input image in the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node outputs two values: IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH (INT) and IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT (INT), which are the width and height values extracted from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node use?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node uses the infra type CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the execute function in the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node do?",
        "answer": "The execute function in the Inference_Core_ImageGenResolutionFromImage node takes an input image, extracts its shape, and returns the width (W) and height (H) of the image."
