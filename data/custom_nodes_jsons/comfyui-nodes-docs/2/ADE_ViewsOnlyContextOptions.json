        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'create_options' method in the ViewAsContextOptionsNode class?",
        "answer": "The 'create_options' method in the ViewAsContextOptionsNode class is designed to generate a set of context options that determine how the view's context is processed and animated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'view_opts_req' parameter do in the ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'view_opts_req' parameter is essential for defining the view options required for the animation context. It lays the foundation for the interpretation and manipulation of the context within the animation framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_percent' parameter affect the animation in ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter specifies the starting percentage of the animation, allowing users to control the initial state of the animation. It is an optional parameter that can fine-tune the beginning of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'guarantee_steps' parameter in ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'guarantee_steps' parameter ensures a minimum number of steps for the animation to run, providing a mechanism to maintain the continuity and stability of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'prev_context' parameter contribute to the functionality of ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_context' parameter allows the inclusion of previous context options into the new set, enabling the method to build upon existing context states and facilitate more complex or layered animation setups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'CONTEXT_OPTS' represent in ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The output 'CONTEXT_OPTS' represents the newly created or updated set of context options that will be used to influence subsequent animation or processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ViewAsContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ViewAsContextOptionsNode is CPU."
