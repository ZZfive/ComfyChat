        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the CR_CentralSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_CentralSchedule node is designed to create and manage complex animation schedules by integrating various types of inputs including text, prompts, and models, resulting in a coherent and dynamic timeline for animation execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is considered the core for the CR_CentralSchedule node to build a schedule?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_1' input, which is the primary scheduling text outlining the sequence of animation actions, is considered the core for the CR_CentralSchedule node to build a schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'schedule_type1' input affect the operation of the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_type1' input specifies the type of schedule, influencing how the node interprets and processes the input text, thus affecting the overall structure and execution of the animation schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'schedule_format' input in the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_format' input determines the final presentation format of the schedule, affecting the readability and usability of the animation schedule for further processing or review."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'schedule_alias1', 'schedule_alias2', and 'schedule_alias3' inputs contribute to the functionality of the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_alias1', 'schedule_alias2', and 'schedule_alias3' inputs serve as aliases for the first, second, and third schedules respectively, enhancing the readability and organization of the animation schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of having optional inputs like 'schedule_2' and 'schedule_3' in the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs 'schedule_2' and 'schedule_3' allow for additional schedule texts to supplement the main schedule, enabling more complex animation sequences and action layering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The CR_CentralSchedule node outputs two types: 'SCHEDULE', which is a compiled and formatted animation schedule, and 'show_text', which is a human-readable representation of the animation schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'SCHEDULE' output structured in the CR_CentralSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'SCHEDULE' output in the CR_CentralSchedule node is structured as a tuple containing a string and a list of tuples, each representing a sequence of actions and timings encapsulated in a structured format for execution within an animation system."
