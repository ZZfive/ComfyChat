        "question": "What is the purpose of the SparseSpreadMethodNode class?",
        "answer": "The SparseSpreadMethodNode class is designed to generate and manage sparse index distributions within a given range. It abstracts the logic for different diffusion methods such as uniform, start, end, and center, allowing flexible handling of sparse data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'spread' parameter in SparseSpreadMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The 'spread' parameter determines how sparse indices are distributed over the entire length range. It is crucial to the operation of the node as it dictates the pattern of sparse data generation, which may significantly influence the outcome of the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of SparseSpreadMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The output of SparseSpreadMethodNode is 'SPARSE_METHOD', which represents the method used for diffusing indices. It is important because it encapsulates the logic of the selected diffusion strategy, which is essential for downstream tasks that rely on sparse index distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for SparseSpreadMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for SparseSpreadMethodNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of SparseSpreadMethodNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of SparseSpreadMethodNode in ComfyUI is 'Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/SparseCtrl'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is SparseSpreadMethodNode an output node?",
        "answer": "No, SparseSpreadMethodNode is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the get_method function in SparseSpreadMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The return type of the get_method function in SparseSpreadMethodNode is a tuple containing an instance of SparseSpreadMethod."
