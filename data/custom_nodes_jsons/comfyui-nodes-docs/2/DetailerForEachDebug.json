        "question": "What is the purpose of the DetailerForEachTest node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DetailerForEachTest node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image details by processing each image segment separately. It utilizes advanced models and techniques to refine and improve image quality, focusing on regions of interest within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DetailerForEachTest node include the input image tensor, segmentation data, model, guide size, guide size for, max size, seed, steps, configuration settings, sampler name, scheduler, positive conditions, and negative conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' input parameter represent in the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node represents the segmentation data that defines the regions of interest within the image. It is crucial for the node to determine which parts of the image need to be focused on for detail enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'guide_size' input parameter affect the detail enhancement process in the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The 'guide_size' input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node determines the scale at which detail enhancement is applied. It is essential for controlling the level of detail that the node will apply to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'max_size' input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_size' input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node limits the resolution of the enhanced image. It ensures that the enhanced image does not exceed a certain size, which may be important for performance or storage considerations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the DetailerForEachTest node include the CLIP tensor, variational autoencoder (VAE), denoise switch, feather parameter, noise mask tensor, force inpaint switch, wildcard parameter, detailer hook function, cycle, inpaint model, and noise mask feather value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'inpaint_model' optional input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_model' optional input parameter in the DetailerForEachTest node is an optional inpainting model that can be used to fill in missing or damaged areas of the image during the enhancement process."
