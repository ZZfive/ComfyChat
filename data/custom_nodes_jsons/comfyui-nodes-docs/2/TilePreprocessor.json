        "question": "What is the purpose of the TilePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node is designed to enhance image quality by applying a tiling effect. It preprocesses the image through tiling for subsequent processing or analysis, focusing on improving visual effects or extracting specific features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the TilePreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image that needs to be processed. It is the main data source for applying the tiling effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input parameters does the TilePreprocessor node have?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node has two optional input parameters: 'pyrUp_iters' which specifies the number of iterations for the pyramid upsampling process, affecting the intensity of the tiling effect applied to the image; and 'resolution' which is the target resolution of the output image, affecting the final size and quality of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the TilePreprocessor node is 'image'. It outputs the image after tiling preprocessing, which may enhance certain features or aspects for further analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the TilePreprocessor node use?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used with the TilePreprocessor node include ControlNetApplyAdvanced, CR Thumbnail Preview, PreviewImage, and ACN_AdvancedControlNetApply."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TilePreprocessor node execute the tiling preprocessing?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node executes the tiling preprocessing by calling the 'common_annotator_call' function with the 'TileDetector' class, passing in the input image, 'pyrUp_iters', and 'resolution' parameters. This function applies the tiling effect to the image based on the specified parameters."
