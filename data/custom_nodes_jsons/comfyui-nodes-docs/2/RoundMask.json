        "question": "What is the purpose of the RoundMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node in ComfyUI is designed to convert the input mask or a batch of masks into binary masks by rounding off the values to the nearest binary value (0 or 1). This operation is crucial for tasks that require clear and explicit mask boundaries without gradients."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the RoundMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the RoundMask node is 'mask', which represents the input mask or a batch of masks that need to be rounded to binary values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RoundMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RoundMask node is 'mask', which represents the binary mask or a batch of binary masks where each pixel value has been rounded to the nearest binary value (0 or 1), ensuring clear and explicit boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the RoundMask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the RoundMask node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the RoundMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the RoundMask node is 'KJNodes/masking' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the RoundMask node?",
        "answer": "The function of the RoundMask node is to 'round' the input mask or batch of masks to binary masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code of RoundMask, what does the 'round' method do?",
        "answer": "In the source code of RoundMask, the 'round' method takes the input 'mask', rounds off the values to the nearest binary values (0 or 1), and returns the rounded mask."
