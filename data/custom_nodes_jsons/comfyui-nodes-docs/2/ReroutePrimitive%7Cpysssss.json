        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReroutePrimitive node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReroutePrimitive node in ComfyUI is designed to pass any given input without modification, acting as a universal connector in the data flow architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the core functionality of the 'value' parameter in the ReroutePrimitive node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter serves as the generic input that the ReroutePrimitive node passes without modification, allowing the node to act as a versatile connector in various data processing scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the ReroutePrimitive node support for input?",
        "answer": "The ReroutePrimitive node supports any data type for input, abstracting away the complexity of data types and allowing flexible rerouting of data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ReroutePrimitive node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ReroutePrimitive node is a tuple containing the unmodified input value, facilitating seamless data rerouting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the ReroutePrimitive node?",
        "answer": "The ReroutePrimitive node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the ReroutePrimitive node implemented in terms of its class definition?",
        "answer": "The ReroutePrimitive node is implemented with a class named ReroutePrimitive, which includes methods for defining input types, validating inputs, and specifying return types, function name, and category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'route' function in the ReroutePrimitive class?",
        "answer": "The 'route' function in the ReroutePrimitive class returns a tuple containing the unmodified input value."
