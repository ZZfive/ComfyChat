        "question": "What is the purpose of the From_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The From_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI is designed to process and convert SEG_ELT objects into a structured format containing images, masks, and various metadata. It plays a key role in preparing data for further analysis and manipulation within the ImpactPack utility suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the seg_elt input parameter in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The seg_elt input parameter is crucial as it represents the core input of the node. It contains the image data and associated metadata for processing. The functionality of the node largely depends on the integrity and format of the seg_elt input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the cropped_image output represent in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The cropped_image output provides a tensor representation of the image data, which is essential for machine learning models that require tensor input formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the crop_region output provide in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The crop_region output specifies the coordinates and dimensions of the cropped area within the image, which is crucial for understanding the spatial context of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the bbox output in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The bbox output provides the bounding box coordinates of the object of interest within the image, which is essential for object detection and localization tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the confidence output represent in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The confidence output reflects the certainty of the segmentation or classification results, which is important for assessing the reliability of the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the label output in the From_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The label output assigns a categorical identifier to the processed data, which is crucial for classification and annotation purposes."
