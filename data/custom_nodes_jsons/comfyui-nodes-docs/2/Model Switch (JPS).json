        "question": "What is the purpose of the Model Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically select one of multiple model inputs based on specified selection criteria. It allows for flexible integration and switching between different models in the workflow, generating diverse outputs based on the selected model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Model Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Model Switch node is 'select', which is an integer value indicating which model input should be used as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Model Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Model Switch node are 'model_1' to 'model_5', representing generic model input options. Based on the value of the 'select' parameter, one of the available model inputs is selected as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Model Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Model Switch node is 'model_out', which is the selected model based on the 'select' parameter. This output helps in dynamically integrating different models into the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Model Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Model Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Model Switch node determine which model to output?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch node determines which model to output based on the value of the 'select' parameter. It uses conditional statements to assign the corresponding model input to 'model_out' based on the integer value of 'select'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute represent in the Model Switch node's source code?",
        "answer": "In the Model Switch node's source code, the 'FUNCTION' attribute represents the name of the method that executes the main functionality of the node, which is 'get_model' in this case."
