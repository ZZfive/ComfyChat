        "question": "What is the purpose of the CenterImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CenterImage node is designed to process an image and center it within a given canvas, with a focus on a specified region. It calculates the required coordinates and dimensions while considering provided margins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional feature does the CenterImage node provide besides centering the image?",
        "answer": "In addition to centering the image, the CenterImage node generates a mask corresponding to the centered area, enhancing its applicability in various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CenterImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CenterImage node are 'canvas' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE), 'left' (Comfy dtype: INT), 'top' (Comfy dtype: INT), 'right' (Comfy dtype: INT), and 'bottom' (Comfy dtype: INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'grid' output of the CenterImage node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'grid' output of the CenterImage node provides the coordinates and dimensions of the centered image within the canvas, which is crucial for further image processing or manipulation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' output of the CenterImage node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' output is a binary image depicting the region of the centered image. It is essential in applications such as masking, filtering, or segmentation within image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CenterImage node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CenterImage node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'left', 'top', 'right', and 'bottom' input parameters in the CenterImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'left', 'top', 'right', and 'bottom' input parameters specify the margins for the centering operation. They are crucial in determining the exact placement of the image within the canvas and contribute to the overall centered appearance."
