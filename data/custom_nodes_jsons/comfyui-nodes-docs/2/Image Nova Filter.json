        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class in ComfyUI is designed to apply a sine wave distortion to images, enhancing their visual features through wavy patterns. It introduces a creative and artistic effect to image processing workflows, allowing control over the intensity and scale of the distortion via amplitude and frequency adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it represents the input image to be processed. It directly affects the execution of the node and the final result, determining the object of the sine wave distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'amplitude' parameter influence the sine wave distortion in WAS_Image_Nova_Filter?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter in WAS_Image_Nova_Filter controls the intensity of the sine wave distortion applied to the image. It is a key factor in determining the visual effect, allowing users to fine-tune the outcome according to their preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'frequency' parameter play in the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' parameter in WAS_Image_Nova_Filter determines the scale of the sine wave pattern applied to the image. It is essential for adjusting the period of the waves, which in turn influences the overall appearance of the distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output_image' represent in the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class?",
        "answer": "The 'output_image' in WAS_Image_Nova_Filter is the result of applying the sine wave distortion to the input image. It represents the final visually altered image, bearing the creative effect intended by the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for using the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the WAS_Image_Nova_Filter class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the sine wave distortion effect achieved in the source code of WAS_Image_Nova_Filter?",
        "answer": "In the source code of WAS_Image_Nova_Filter, the sine wave distortion effect is achieved by iterating over each pixel in the input image array and applying a sine function to each color channel. The sine function takes into account the pixel value, frequency, and amplitude to determine the final distorted color value."
