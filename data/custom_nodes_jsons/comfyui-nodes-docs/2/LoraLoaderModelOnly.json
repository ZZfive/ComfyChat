        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoraLoaderModelOnly node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoraLoaderModelOnly node is designed to efficiently load and integrate Lora models into existing model architectures, enhancing the capabilities of the base model without the need to reload the full model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the LoraLoaderModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial as it represents the base model into which the Lora adjustments will be integrated. It is essential for the execution of the node as it determines the model to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_name' parameter specify in the LoraLoaderModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' parameter specifies the name of the Lora file to be loaded. It is vital for identifying the correct Lora model that needs to be applied to the base model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'strength_model' parameter play in the LoraLoaderModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength_model' parameter allows users to control the strength of the Lora adjustments applied to the model. It plays an important role in fine-tuning the model's performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' output represent in the LoraLoaderModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' output represents the modified model with the integrated Lora adjustments. It is the result of the node's functionality, providing a model enhanced by the specified Lora modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the LoraLoaderModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the LoraLoaderModelOnly node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the LoraLoaderModelOnly node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the LoraLoaderModelOnly node defines the input types, return types, and the function to load the Lora model. It also includes the logic to integrate the Lora adjustments into the base model."
