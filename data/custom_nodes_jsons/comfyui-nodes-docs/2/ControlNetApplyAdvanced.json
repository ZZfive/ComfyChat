        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvanced node in ComfyUI is designed to apply control nets to a set of conditioning inputs, enhancing the precision and control of the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node are positive conditioning, negative conditioning, control_net, image, strength, start_percent, and end_percent."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter affect the output in the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node determines the intensity of the control net's influence on the output, controlling the extent of changes caused by the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_percent' parameter specify in the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter specifies the starting point of the control net effect relative to the image dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'end_percent' parameter in the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'end_percent' parameter marks the endpoint of the control net influence, defining the range over which the control net affects the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node are positive conditioning and negative conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node refine the positive conditioning output?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvanced node refines the positive conditioning output by adjusting it with the control net, ensuring that the desired features are more prominent in the final output."
