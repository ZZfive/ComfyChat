        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy loadImageBase64 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy loadImageBase64 node in ComfyUI is used to load images encoded in Base64 format and convert them into a format suitable for further image processing or operations within the ComfyUI framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the easy loadImageBase64 node are base64_data, image_output, and save_prefix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the base64_data parameter represent in the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The base64_data parameter represents the Base64 encoded string of the image data. It is crucial for decoding the image back into a format that can be used for processing and manipulation within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the image_output parameter in the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The image_output parameter specifies how the loaded image should be handled, such as displaying, hiding, or saving the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the save_prefix parameter determine in the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The save_prefix parameter determines the filename prefix when saving the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the easy loadImageBase64 node are image and mask. The image output is the processed image in tensor format, while the mask output provides an optional mask tensor if the image contains transparency information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the easy loadImageBase64 node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the easy loadImageBase64 node is CPU."
