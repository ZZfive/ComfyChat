        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Switch (JPS) node is designed to select and output one image from multiple input images based on a given selection index, enabling dynamic image routing and conditional image processing paths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'select' parameter in the Image Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter determines which input image to output based on its numeric index. It is crucial for controlling the flow of images through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the Image Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the Image Switch (JPS) node are img_1 to img_5, representing a series of selectable input images. The specific image to be selected is determined by the 'select' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Switch (JPS) node is IMAGE, specifically the 'img_out' parameter, which is the selected output image based on the 'select' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Image Switch (JPS) node use?",
        "answer": "The Image Switch (JPS) node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Switch (JPS) node determine which image to output?",
        "answer": "The Image Switch (JPS) node determines which image to output by comparing the value of the 'select' parameter and selecting the corresponding image from img_1 to img_5 based on the index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'get_image' function in the Image Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'get_image' function in the Image Switch (JPS) node is a tuple containing the selected output image ('img_out')."
