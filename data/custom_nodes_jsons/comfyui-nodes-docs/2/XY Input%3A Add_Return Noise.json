        "question": "What is the purpose of the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to handle XY input types, specifically for adding or returning noise in a given process. It maps the input types to corresponding noise operations and enables or disables noise based on the specified type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node is XY_type, which specifies the type of noise operation to be performed. It can be either adding noise or returning the remaining noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the XY_type input specify in the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node?",
        "answer": "The XY_type input in the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node specifies the type of noise operation to be executed. It can be set to either 'add_noise' or 'return_with_leftover_noise', determining how the node processes the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output of the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node is either X or Y, representing the result of the node's processing. It can be data with added noise or returned remaining noise, depending on the XY_type input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node belong?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node belongs to the Efficiency Nodes/XY Inputs category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node determine the xy_type based on the XY_type input?",
        "answer": "The TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise node uses a type_mapping dictionary to map the XY_type input to the corresponding xy_type. If XY_type is 'add_noise', xy_type is set to 'AddNoise', and if XY_type is 'return_with_leftover_noise', xy_type is set to 'ReturnNoise'."
