        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node in ComfyUI is designed to increase the dimensions of an input image by a specified factor, supporting various upscaling methods to maintain or enhance image quality during the enlargement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node include the original image to be scaled, the upscale_method to determine the scaling algorithm, and the factor defining the scale ratio for the original image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_method' parameter in the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node control?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_method' parameter in the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node controls the algorithm used for scaling the image. It is crucial for managing the quality and characteristics of the upscaled image, with different methods potentially yielding different results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'factor' parameter used in the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter in the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node defines the scaling ratio that the original image dimensions are multiplied by. It directly influences the final size of the upscaled image and the level of detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node is the 'upscaled_image', which is the result of the upscaling process, reflecting the input image scaled by the specified factor. It is important as it represents the direct outcome of the node's operations and is used for further processing or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node is GPU, indicating that the node's operations are optimized for or require the use of a graphics processing unit for efficient performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node's 'upscale' method print during processing?",
        "answer": "During processing, the 'upscale' method of the WLSH_Image_Scale_By_Factor node prints a message indicating the original dimensions of the image and the new dimensions after scaling, showing the change in size."
