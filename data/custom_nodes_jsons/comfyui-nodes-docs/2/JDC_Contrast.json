        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the ImageContrast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the ImageContrast node is to enhance the visual appeal of an image by adjusting its contrast and brightness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input parameters for the ImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter is the IMAGE, which is the main input for the node to process. The optional input parameters are contrast and brightness, both of which are of FLOAT data type and control the enhancement of contrast and adjustment of brightness in the image, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the contrast parameter affect the image in the ImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The contrast parameter plays an important role in the node's operation by controlling the enhancement of the image's contrast. Adjusting this parameter allows the node to make the light and dark areas of the image more distinct, thereby improving the overall visual impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the brightness parameter affect the image in the ImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The brightness parameter is crucial for adjusting the overall brightness or darkness of the image. It can be used to create specific moods or effects, and its adjustment directly influences the final appearance of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageContrast node is IMAGE, which is the result of the node's processing and reflects the adjustments made to the input image's contrast and brightness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImageContrast node run on?",
        "answer": "The ImageContrast node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageContrast node process the image to enhance its contrast and brightness?",
        "answer": "The ImageContrast node processes the image by first converting it to a PIL.Image format. It then uses the ImageEnhance.Contrast and ImageEnhance.Brightness classes to enhance the contrast and brightness of the image based on the provided contrast and brightness parameters. Finally, it converts the processed image back to a tensor format before returning it."
