        "question": "What is the purpose of the LimitNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LimitNumber node in ComfyUI restricts a given number within a specified range, ensuring it does not exceed defined minimum and maximum boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LimitNumber node?",
        "answer": "The LimitNumber node requires three input parameters: 'number', which is the input number to be restricted within the specified range; 'min_value', which sets the lower limit for the acceptable range; and 'max_value', which defines the upper limit for the acceptable range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are accepted for the 'number' input parameter in the LimitNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' input parameter in the LimitNumber node accepts any data type that is a union of int and float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the 'min_value' and 'max_value' input parameters defined in the LimitNumber node?",
        "answer": "In the LimitNumber node, 'min_value' and 'max_value' are defined as integers with default values of 0 and 1, respectively. They have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 18446744073709551615, with a step of 1. The display type for both is set to 'number'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LimitNumber node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LimitNumber node is the 'number' that has been restricted within the specified range based on the input parameters. The data type of the output is a union of int and float."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the LimitNumber node process input as a list?",
        "answer": "No, the INPUT_IS_LIST attribute is set to False for the LimitNumber node, indicating that it does not process input as a list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LimitNumber node run on?",
        "answer": "The LimitNumber node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
