        "question": "What is the class name of the RemapPinch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the RemapPinch node is 'RemapPinch'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the RemapPinch node belong to?",
        "answer": "The RemapPinch node belongs to the 'Bmad/CV/Transform' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the RemapPinch node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the RemapPinch node is not an output node. It is used for applying pinch effects to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RemapPinch node are 'power_x', 'power_y', 'center_x', and 'center_y', all of which are of the FLOAT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'power_x' input in the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The 'power_x' input specifies the extent of the horizontal pinch effect to be applied. Higher values result in a more pronounced pinch effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'center_x' input in the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The 'center_x' input determines the horizontal center for applying the pinch effect. The value ranges from 0 to 1, representing the width of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the RemapPinch node return?",
        "answer": "The RemapPinch node returns a 'remap' output type, which is used to apply the specified pinch distortion effect to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the RemapPinch node use?",
        "answer": "The RemapPinch node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
