        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_XYIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYIndex node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the corresponding x and y coordinates in a grid structure based on a given index value. It serves as a utility for mapping a linear index to a two-dimensional grid space, which is crucial for various applications such as image processing or data indexing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CR_XYIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CR_XYIndex node are 'x_columns', 'y_rows', and 'index'. 'x_columns' specifies the number of columns in the grid, 'y_rows' defines the number of rows, and 'index' is the linear index to be converted into grid coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x_columns' parameter in the CR_XYIndex node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'x_columns' parameter in the CR_XYIndex node specifies the number of columns in the grid. It is a key element in determining the grid layout and a decisive factor in calculating the x and y coordinates for a given index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'index' parameter in the CR_XYIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter in the CR_XYIndex node is the linear index that needs to be converted into grid coordinates. It is central to the node's operation as it serves as the starting point for all calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the output parameters 'x' and 'y' represent in the CR_XYIndex node?",
        "answer": "In the CR_XYIndex node, the output 'x' represents the calculated x-coordinate within the grid based on the provided index, indicating the horizontal position. The output 'y' represents the calculated y-coordinate within the grid, which is crucial for determining the vertical position of the index in the grid structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output provide in the CR_XYIndex node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR_XYIndex node provides a URL link to documentation for further assistance. It serves as a useful resource for users seeking more information about the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_XYIndex node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYIndex node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
