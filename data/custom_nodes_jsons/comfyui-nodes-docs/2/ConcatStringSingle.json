        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConcatStringSingle node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConcatStringSingle node is designed to merge two strings into a single string, serving as a fundamental tool in text manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ConcatStringSingle node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ConcatStringSingle node are 'string_a' and 'string_b', both of which are of the Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of 'string_a' in the ConcatStringSingle node?",
        "answer": "The 'string_a' input represents the first string to be concatenated. It plays a crucial role in the final output as it forms the initial part of the combined string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of 'string_b' in the ConcatStringSingle node?",
        "answer": "The 'string_b' input represents the second string to be concatenated. It is important as it provides the string portion that follows the first string in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConcatStringSingle node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ConcatStringSingle node is 'concatenated_string', which is of the Comfy dtype STRING and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'concatenated_string' represent in the ConcatStringSingle node?",
        "answer": "The output 'concatenated_string' represents the combined string resulting from the concatenation of 'string_a' and 'string_b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the ConcatStringSingle node use?",
        "answer": "The ConcatStringSingle node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
