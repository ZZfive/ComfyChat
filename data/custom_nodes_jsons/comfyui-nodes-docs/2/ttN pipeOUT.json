        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN pipeOUT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipeOUT node is designed to aggregate and output the various components of a generative pipeline, including the model, conditioning data, latent representation, and generated image. It serves as the final step in the pipeline, integrating the outputs for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'pipe' parameter in the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline state, encapsulating all relevant data including the model, conditional inputs, and generated outputs. It is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the content and structure of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ttN pipeOUT node include model, pos (positive conditioning), neg (negative conditioning), latent, vae, clip, image, seed, and pipe."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' output represent in the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' output represents the model used in the pipeline. Its Comfy dtype is MODEL and Python dtype is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent' output represent in the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output represents the latent representation generated by the pipeline. Its Comfy dtype is LATENT and Python dtype is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output represent in the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output represents the generated image. Its Comfy dtype is IMAGE and Python dtype is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ttN pipeOUT node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ttN pipeOUT node?",
        "answer": "The category of the ttN pipeOUT node is ttN/legacy."
