        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node are 'parameter_group' and 'curve'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'parameter_group' input in the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The 'parameter_group' input defines the set of parameters that the node will adjust by multiplying their values with the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'curve' input in the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' input defines the multiplication factor for the parameter group at different points in time, controlling the dynamic adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node is 'result', which is a modified parameter group with values adjusted based on the curve multiplication."

        "question": "What does the 'main' function in the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node return?",
        "answer": "The 'main' function in the KfPGroupCurveMultiply node returns a tuple containing the modified parameter group after multiplying it with the curve."
