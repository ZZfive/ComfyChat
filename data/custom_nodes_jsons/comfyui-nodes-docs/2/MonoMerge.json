        "question": "What is the purpose of the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MonoMerge node in ComfyUI is used to merge two images into a single monochromatic image, emphasizing either the lighter or darker tones based on the specified target color scheme."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MonoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MonoMerge node are: image1 (the first image to be merged), image2 (the second image to be merged), target (the target color scheme, either 'white' or 'black'), and output_format (the desired output format for the merged image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MonoMerge node determine which pixels to keep in the final image?",
        "answer": "The MonoMerge node compares the brightness of corresponding pixels in the two input images and selects the pixel that aligns with the specified target color scheme, creating a new image that highlights either the lighter or darker features of the merged images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MonoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MonoMerge node is a single monochromatic image that combines elements from the input images based on the specified target color scheme, emphasizing either lighter or darker tones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MonoMerge node use?",
        "answer": "The MonoMerge node uses the 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'target' parameter in the MonoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'target' parameter in the MonoMerge node is 'white'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'output_format' parameter in the MonoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'output_format' parameter in the MonoMerge node is the first option in the image_output_formats_options list."
