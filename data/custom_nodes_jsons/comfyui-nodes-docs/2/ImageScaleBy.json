        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleBy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleBy node in ComfyUI is designed to improve the resolution of input images by applying various upscaling methods. It allows users to select from a range of scaling techniques to achieve the desired results, focusing on overall improving image quality without altering the original content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageScaleBy node are: image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), upscale_method (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), and scale_by (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it is the input that will be upscaled. It directly affects the execution process and the quality of the final upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_method' parameter determine in the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_method' parameter determines the algorithm used for image upscaling. It is essential for achieving the desired visual effect and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale_by' parameter define in the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_by' parameter defines the scaling factor of the image and is a key determinant of the final image size. It significantly influences the node's execution and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageScaleBy node is 'upscaled_image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents the processed result of the node, showing the upscaled version of the input image using the selected method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the ImageScaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ImageScaleBy node is CPU."
