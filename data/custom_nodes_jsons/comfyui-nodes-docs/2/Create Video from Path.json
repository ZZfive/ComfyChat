        "question": "What is the purpose of the Create Video from Path node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Create Video from Path node in ComfyUI is used to create videos from a series of images, supporting custom transitions, frame delays, and video properties such as frame rate and resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Create Video from Path node generate smooth transitions between images?",
        "answer": "The Create Video from Path node utilizes computer vision technology to generate smooth transitions between images, making it suitable for creating morphing effects or slideshows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the transition_frames parameter in the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The transition_frames parameter in the Create Video from Path node specifies the number of frames used for the transition between images to achieve a smooth morphing effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the image_delay_sec parameter be used to control the display duration of each image in the video?",
        "answer": "The image_delay_sec parameter in the Create Video from Path node determines the delay time in seconds for each image before transitioning to the next one, allowing control over the display duration of each image in the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the fps parameter in the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The fps parameter in the Create Video from Path node sets the frame rate (fps) of the output video, affecting the smoothness and playback speed of the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the max_size parameter ensure consistent resolution in the output video?",
        "answer": "The max_size parameter in the Create Video from Path node defines the maximum size in pixels for the width or height of the images, ensuring that the video maintains a consistent resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the codec parameter in the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The codec parameter in the Create Video from Path node specifies the codec used to encode the video, affecting compatibility and quality."
