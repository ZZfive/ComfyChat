        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node in ComfyUI applies tonemapping and noise rescaling configurations to a given model, enhancing the model's ability to process conditional and unconditional inputs by adjusting their scale and contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node are: model (the model to which the tonemapping and noise rescaling configurations will be applied), tonemap_multiplier (a float value that adjusts the intensity of the tonemapping effect), and rescale_multiplier (a float value that adjusts the balance between the original noise prediction and the modified noise prediction in the final output)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the tonemap_multiplier input do in the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The tonemap_multiplier input in the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node adjusts the intensity of the tonemapping effect, affecting the contrast and brightness of noise in the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the rescale_multiplier input do in the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The rescale_multiplier input in the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node adjusts the balance between the original noise prediction and the modified noise prediction in the final output, affecting the scale of the conditional generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node is a modified model with updated sampling behavior that incorporates the specified tonemapping and noise rescaling configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infratype does the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node require?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node requires a GPU infratype."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TonemapNoiseWithRescaleCFG node is classified under the custom_node_experiments category in ComfyUI."
