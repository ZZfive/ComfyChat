        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Int node is designed to encapsulate and process integer values in a node-based programming environment. It provides a direct way to handle integers in a visual programming environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the IG Int node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the IG Int node is 'value', which specifies the integer value to be used or operated on by the node. This parameter is the core of the node's operation and serves as the main input determining the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data type does the 'value' input expect?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input expects the Comfy data type 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type corresponds to the 'value' input?",
        "answer": "The Python data type that corresponds to the 'value' input is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the IG Int node output?",
        "answer": "The IG Int node outputs the integer value specified by the input parameter 'value', effectively passing the value through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy data type does the output of the IG Int node have?",
        "answer": "The output of the IG Int node has the Comfy data type 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type corresponds to the output of the IG Int node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type that corresponds to the output of the IG Int node is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the IG Int node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the IG Int node is 'CPU'."
