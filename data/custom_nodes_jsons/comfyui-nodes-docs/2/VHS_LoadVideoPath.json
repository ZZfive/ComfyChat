        "question": "What does the hash_path function do in VHS_LoadVideoPath?",
        "answer": "The hash_path function calculates the hash value of a file path. In the context of VHS_LoadVideoPath, it's used to determine if the loaded video has changed from the previous run. By using the hash value, VHS_LoadVideoPath can avoid unnecessary reloading and reprocessing of the video if the file hasn't changed."

        "question": "How can VHS_LoadVideoPath be used in a video processing pipeline?",
        "answer": "VHS_LoadVideoPath can be used as the first node in a video processing pipeline to load the initial video file that will be processed. It provides the necessary metadata about the video, such as its resolution and frame rate, which can then be used by subsequent nodes in the pipeline for further processing or analysis. For example, if you want to crop a video, you would typically annotate the video with crop metadata in order to ensure the final output is cropped correctly."
