        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node in the ReActor framework?",
        "answer": "The ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node is designed to batch process face models within the ReActor framework. It can create or process multiple face models simultaneously, simplifying workflows that require handling multiple face models, such as batch face analysis, swapping, or repairing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'face_model1' input in the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'face_model1' input is crucial for the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node as it serves as the primary face model required for processing. It sets the baseline for batch operations by determining the starting point, thereby influencing the execution process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the optional 'face_model2' to 'face_model10' inputs contribute to the functionality of the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'face_model2' to 'face_model10' inputs allow the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node to handle a more complex or diverse range of batch processing operations. By including these additional models, the node can process a variety of models within a single batch operation, affecting its execution by introducing variability and complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node is FACE_MODELS, which represents a collection of the face models processed in the batch. This output can be used for further analysis or utilization in various scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the input face models in the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input face models in the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node is FACE_MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the input face models in the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the input face models in the ReActorMakeFaceModelBatch node is torch.Tensor."
