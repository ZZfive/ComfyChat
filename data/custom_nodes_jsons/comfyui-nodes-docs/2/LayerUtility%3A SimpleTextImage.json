        "question": "What is the purpose of the SimpleTextImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SimpleTextImage node is designed to generate an image and a mask from input text, using a specified font file and alignment options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default size of the output image and mask?",
        "answer": "The default size of the output image and mask is 512x512 pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SimpleTextImage node handle text wrapping?",
        "answer": "The node uses the `textwrap` module to wrap text into multiple lines within the specified image width. The number of characters per line is determined by the `char_per_line` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SimpleTextImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types are:\n- Text: The input text to be displayed.\n- Font File: The path to the font file.\n- Alignment: The alignment of the text within the image ('center', 'left', 'right').\n- Character Per Line: The maximum number of characters per line.\n- Leading: The line spacing in pixels.\n- Font Size: The size of the font in pixels.\n- Text Color: The color of the text in hexadecimal format.\n- Stroke Width: The width of the text stroke in pixels.\n- Stroke Color: The color of the text stroke in hexadecimal format.\n- X Offset, Y Offset: The offsets in pixels for the text position.\n- Width, Height: The width and height of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the SimpleTextImage node?",
        "answer": "The output types are:\n- Image: The generated image with text.\n- Mask: The generated mask corresponding to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SimpleTextImage node handle the input size?",
        "answer": "The node can either accept a specific user-defined size or automatically adjust the size based on the input image or mask provided with the `size_as` parameter. If `size_as` is provided, the width and height of the output image/mask will match those of the input, priority is given to the `size_as` input over the width and height parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category and function of the SimpleTextImage node?",
        "answer": "The category of the SimpleTextImage node is `ðŸ˜ºdzNodes/LayerUtility`. Its function, coded as `simple_text_image`, generates a text image and an accompanying mask."
