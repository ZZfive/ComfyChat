        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'LatentAdd' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'LatentAdd' node in ComfyUI is designed to perform element-wise addition on two sets of latent samples, ensuring that the samples are properly reshaped to match dimensions before addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'LatentAdd' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'LatentAdd' node are 'samples1' and 'samples2', both of which are of the Comfy data type 'LATENT' and Python data type 'Dict[str, torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples1' parameter represent in the 'LatentAdd' node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples1' parameter represents the first set of latent samples to be added. It plays a key role in the node's operation as it provides one of the operands for the addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples2' parameter represent in the 'LatentAdd' node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples2' parameter holds the second set of latent samples to be added to 'samples1'. Compatibility between 'samples2' and 'samples1' in shape and type is crucial for the successful execution of the node function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'LatentAdd' node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'LatentAdd' node is 'samples_out', which is of the Comfy data type 'LATENT' and Python data type 'Dict[str, torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples_out' parameter in the 'LatentAdd' node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'samples_out' parameter represents the result of the addition operation performed by the node. It contains the added latent samples, which are significant as they represent the output of the node's main function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the 'LatentAdd' node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the 'LatentAdd' node is CPU."
