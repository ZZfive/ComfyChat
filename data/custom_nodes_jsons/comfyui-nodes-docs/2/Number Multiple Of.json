        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class is to determine if a given number is a multiple of another specified number. If it is not, the method calculates the nearest multiple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class are 'number', which is the value to check if it is a multiple, and 'multiple', which defines the divisor used to determine if 'number' is a multiple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'multiple' parameter in WAS_Number_Multiple_Of?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'multiple' parameter in WAS_Number_Multiple_Of is 8."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class is 'result', which represents the nearest multiple of the input number if it is not originally a multiple of the specified 'multiple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class uses the CPU infrastructure type."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_Number_Multiple_Of class in ComfyUI is 'WAS Suite/Number/Functions'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the number_multiple_of function determine the nearest multiple?",
        "answer": "The number_multiple_of function determines the nearest multiple by using the formula 'number // multiple * multiple + multiple' if the number is not originally a multiple of the specified 'multiple'."
