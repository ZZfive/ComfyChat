        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The ToBasicPipe node is designed to simplify the assembly of the basic pipeline for processing the model. It efficiently combines various components such as the model, clip, VAE, and conditional input into a coherent structure for further operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types of the ToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The required input types of the ToBasicPipe node include model, clip, VAE, positive, and negative. These parameters are essential for the node's functionality and are typed as model, CLIP, VAE, CONDITIONING, and CONDITIONING in the ComfyUI system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToBasicPipe node is basic_pipe. This output encapsulates the combined components into a single, coherent pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for the ToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The ToBasicPipe node is suitable for CPU usage and can be used to create a basic pipeline for processing the model."
