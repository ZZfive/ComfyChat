        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltImageBlendingModes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltImageBlendingModes node is designed to blend two sets of images together using various blending modes, allowing for the creation of composite images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltImageBlendingModes node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SaltImageBlendingModes node are: images_a (the first set of images to blend), images_b (the second set of images to blend), mode (the blending mode to use), and blend_percentage (the strength of the blend between the two sets of images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'masks' input in the SaltImageBlendingModes node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'masks' input in the SaltImageBlendingModes node allows for the application of masks to the images to control where the blending occurs, enabling the creation of more precise or complex composite images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available blending modes in the SaltImageBlendingModes node?",
        "answer": "The available blending modes in the SaltImageBlendingModes node are: normal, color, color_burn, color_dodge, darken, difference, exclusion, hard_light, hue, lighten, multiply, overlay, screen, and soft_light."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltImageBlendingModes node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltImageBlendingModes node is a set of blended images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltImageBlendingModes node handle different image sizes?",
        "answer": "In the SaltImageBlendingModes node, if the second set of images (images_b) have different sizes than the first set (images_a), the images_b will be resized to match the size of images_a before blending."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'masks' input is provided in the SaltImageBlendingModes node?",
        "answer": "If the 'masks' input is provided in the SaltImageBlendingModes node, the masks will be resized to match the size of the images and used to control the blending process. The blended image will be a composite of the output image and the original image based on the mask."
