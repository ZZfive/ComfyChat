        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Image node in ComfyUI-Keyframed?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Image node is designed to facilitate the visualization of image data within the workflow, providing a means to inspect and verify image inputs or outputs at different stages of processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of the image parameter for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The image parameter is crucial for the KfDebug_Image node as it is the primary input that the node visualizes. It allows the node to display the image for examination, ensuring that the image data meets expectations and helping to identify any potential issues or discrepancies, impacting the overall debugging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the comfy dtype of the image input parameter for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The comfy dtype of the image input parameter for the KfDebug_Image node is COMBO[numpy.ndarray,PIL.Image,torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the image input parameter for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the image input parameter for the KfDebug_Image node is Union[numpy.ndarray, PIL.Image, torch.Tensor]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output image of the KfDebug_Image node represent?",
        "answer": "The output image of the KfDebug_Image node serves as a visual confirmation of the input image's state. It is important as it provides a way to verify the integrity and accuracy of the image data after it has been passed through the workflow, ensuring that no changes or corruption have occurred."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the comfy dtype of the output image for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The comfy dtype of the output image for the KfDebug_Image node is IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output image for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output image for the KfDebug_Image node is Union[numpy.ndarray, PIL.Image]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infra type for the KfDebug_Image node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the KfDebug_Image node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KfDebug_Image node extend the functionality of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Image node extends the functionality of ComfyUI by providing a debugging tool that allows users to visually inspect and verify image data at different stages of processing within the workflow."
