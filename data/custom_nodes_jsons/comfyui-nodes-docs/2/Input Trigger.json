        "question": "What is the purpose of the Trigger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Trigger node in ComfyUI acts as a conditional gate that evaluates inputs to determine if they meet specified conditions, thereby controlling the flow of data through the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'always_true' input in the Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'always_true' input is a boolean flag that, when true, directly triggers the node's action. It is a key parameter because it represents the main condition for node activation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'anything' input in the Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'anything' input is an optional input that, if present, can help trigger the node, adding flexibility to the conditions required for node activation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Trigger node is 'ret', which indicates whether the activation conditions have been met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Trigger node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the Trigger node is CPU."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Trigger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Trigger node in ComfyUI is ðŸ˜ºdzNodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Trigger node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Trigger node is an output node in ComfyUI."
