    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'white_level' parameter do in the WAS_Image_Levels node?",
        "answer": "The 'white_level' parameter in the WAS_Image_Levels node is important for defining the brightest point in the image, assisting with highlights and the brightest whites."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Levels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Levels node is an image, which is the result of the tonal adjustments, showing enhanced contrast and refined visual details achieved by manipulating the black, mid, and white levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Levels node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Levels node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
