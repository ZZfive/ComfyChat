        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node in ComfyUI is used to apply a mask sequence to latent representations, modifying them by incorporating the mask sequence into the structure of the latent samples. It aims to integrate specific mask patterns into the latent space for targeted modifications or enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node requires two input types: 'samples', which are the latent representations to which the mask sequence will be applied, and 'mask_sequence', which is the mask sequence that will be applied to the latent samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node is 'latent', which represents the modified latent representation after applying the mask sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node in ComfyUI is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'mask_sequence' input in the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'mask_sequence' input in the JWMaskSequenceApplyToLatent node is 'torch.Tensor'."
