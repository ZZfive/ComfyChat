        "question": "What is the purpose of the StableSRColorFix node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StableSRColorFix node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the color quality of images by applying advanced color correction techniques. It intelligently adjusts the color palette of the input image to match a reference color mapping image, resulting in visually coherent and aesthetically pleasing output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the StableSRColorFix node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the StableSRColorFix node are: 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image or torch.Tensor), 'color_map_image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: PIL.Image.Image or torch.Tensor), and 'color_fix' (Comfy dtype: COMBO['Wavelet', 'AdaIN'], Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'image' input in the StableSRColorFix node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input is a crucial parameter for the StableSRColorFix node as it is the primary data that will undergo color correction. The node processes this image to align its color distribution with the color_map_image, ensuring visual consistency in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'color_map_image' input in the StableSRColorFix node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_map_image' input serves as the reference for the node to perform color adjustments. It is essential for guiding the color correction process to achieve a harmonious color palette in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two color correction algorithm options available in the 'color_fix' parameter?",
        "answer": "The two color correction algorithm options available in the 'color_fix' parameter are 'Wavelet' and 'AdaIN'. These methods provide different approaches to color adjustment, significantly influencing the final appearance of the corrected image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the StableSRColorFix node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the StableSRColorFix node is 'refined_image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents an enhanced version of the input image with improved color fidelity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the StableSRColorFix node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the StableSRColorFix node is GPU."
