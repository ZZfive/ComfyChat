        "question": "What is the purpose of the MikeySampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MikeySampler node in ComfyUI is designed to generate high-quality samples from a given base model and refiner model while utilizing VAE for latent space manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the seed parameter in the MikeySampler node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter is crucial for the reproducibility of the sampling process, ensuring that samples generated across different runs are consistent. It plays an important role in controlling the randomness of the sampling algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MikeySampler node refine the samples generated by the base model?",
        "answer": "The MikeySampler node uses a refiner model to further enhance the quality of the samples generated by the base model. It refines the latent space representation to achieve higher fidelity in the final output."

    {
        "question": "What is the function of the upscale_by parameter in the MikeySampler node?",
        "answer": "The upscale_by parameter determines the scaling factor for the generated image. It is an important factor in controlling the final output resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the hires_strength parameter affect the image upscaling process in the MikeySampler node?",
        "answer": "The hires_strength parameter adjusts the intensity of the high-resolution upscaling process. It influences the clarity and level of detail in the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MikeySampler node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MikeySampler node is an encoded latent vector representing the sampled and refined latent space. This vector serves as an intermediate representation between the model and the final upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the MikeySampler node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the MikeySampler node is GPU."
