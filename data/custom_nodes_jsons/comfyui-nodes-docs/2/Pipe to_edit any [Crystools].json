        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Pipe to/edit any' node is designed to flexibly modify or update any data type sequence. It allows flexible editing of input through replacement or retaining original values, making it a versatile tool for data operation and flow control within pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported input types for the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Pipe to/edit any' node supports two types of input:\n- Required: CPipeAny, representing the original data sequence to be modified or updated, acting as a baseline for any editing or changes applied through the node.\n- Optional: any_i, an optional parameter that, if provided, will replace the corresponding element in the original sequence. Index 'i' can range from 1 to 6, allowing targeted modifications of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the output type cpipeany from the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The cpipeany output type from the 'Pipe to/edit any' node represents the modified or updated data sequence after processing by the node. It encapsulates a new sequence that may contain replaced or retained original values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the cpipeany output type determined by the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The cpipeany output type is determined automatically by the 'Pipe to/edit any' node. It encapsulates the modified or updated data sequence generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the supported usage type for the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Pipe to/edit any' node is supported for use on the CPU. The exact list of common nodes that can be used with it is unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'execute' function of the 'Pipe to/edit any' node do?",
        "answer": "The 'execute' function of the 'Pipe to/edit any' node takes as input the original data sequence (CPipeAny), along with optional parameters any_1 to any_6. It then determines whether to replace the current element with the corresponding optional parameter. Finally, it returns the modified or updated data sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the 'Pipe to/edit any' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Pipe to/edit any' node belongs to the category of Main + Pipe."
