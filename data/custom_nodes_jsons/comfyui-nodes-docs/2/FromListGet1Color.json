        "question": "What is the purpose of the FromListGet1Color node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Color node in ComfyUI is designed to retrieve a single color value from a list of colors based on a specified index. It simplifies the process of accessing list elements and allows for direct retrieval of color information in a user-friendly manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the FromListGet1Color node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the FromListGet1Color node are 'list' and 'index'. The 'list' parameter represents the list of colors from which a single color will be retrieved, and the 'index' parameter specifies the position from which the color will be retrieved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used for the input parameters of the FromListGet1Color node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'list' input parameter uses the COLOR data type, and in Python, it uses the List[str] data type. The 'index' input parameter uses the INT data type in ComfyUI and the int data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FromListGet1Color node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FromListGet1Color node is a single color value retrieved from the specified position in the input color list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used for the output of the FromListGet1Color node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FromListGet1Color node uses the COLOR data type in ComfyUI and the str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the FromListGet1Color node support both positive and negative indexing?",
        "answer": "Yes, the FromListGet1Color node supports both positive and negative indexing, allowing for accessing elements from the beginning or end of the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the FromListGet1Color node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type used by the FromListGet1Color node is CPU."
