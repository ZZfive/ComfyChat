    {
        "question": "How does the infer_mode parameter influence the operation of the MotionctrlCond node?",
        "answer": "The infer_mode parameter determines how the MotionctrlCond node processes motion and camera control, providing flexibility in adapting to different inference requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the context_overlap parameter define in the MotionctrlCond node?",
        "answer": "The context_overlap parameter in the MotionctrlCond node defines the overlap range for aligning the camera and trajectory. It affects how the node integrates previous context into the current motion control sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MotionctrlCond node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the MotionctrlCond node include positive conditioning signals, negative conditioning signals, trajectory list, RT list, trajectory features, RT parameters, noise shape, and context overlap."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MotionctrlCond node handle the camera and trajectory alignment?",
        "answer": "The MotionctrlCond node aligns the camera and trajectory by loading and updating alignment files, ensuring that the viewpoint of the camera and the controlled motion are correctly aligned for consistent visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the noise_shape output in the MotionctrlCond node?",
        "answer": "The noise_shape output in the MotionctrlCond node defines the dimensions of the noise applied to the motion control system, which is crucial for certain types of simulations or training processes that involve injecting noise."
