        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfApplyCurveToCond node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfApplyCurveToCond node dynamically adjusts the intensity of conditioning data based on a specified curve, allowing for fine control over the influence of conditioning variables during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KfApplyCurveToCond node are 'curve' (KEYFRAMED_CURVE) and 'cond' (CONDITIONING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'curve' input represent in the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' input in the KfApplyCurveToCond node represents a series of values that will be used to modulate the conditioning data, representing the desired adjustment to the conditioning strength over time or other variables."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cond' input represent in the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond' input in the KfApplyCurveToCond node represents the conditioning data that will be adjusted by the curve input, typically including tensors and their associated metadata, providing context for the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the KfApplyCurveToCond node are 'latents' (LATENT), 'start_t' (INT), and 'n' (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents' optional input do in the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' optional input in the KfApplyCurveToCond node can be used to further refine the application of the curve to the conditioning data, enhancing the node's adaptability to different use cases."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfApplyCurveToCond node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfApplyCurveToCond node is 'cond_out' (CONDITIONING), which represents the modified conditioning data with adjusted intensity according to the input curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the KfApplyCurveToCond node use?",
        "answer": "The KfApplyCurveToCond node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
