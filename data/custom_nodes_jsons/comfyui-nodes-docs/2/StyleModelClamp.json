        "question": "What is the purpose of the StyleModelClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StyleModelClamp node is designed to pass style model data without modification, acting as a placeholder or checkpoint in the data processing pipeline. It ensures the integrity and continuity of style model information as it flows through different processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the StyleModelClamp node is 'style_model', which represents the style model data that needs to be clamped. This parameter is crucial for keeping the style model information unchanged as it flows through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'style_model' input in the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'style_model' input in the StyleModelClamp node is STYLE_MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'style_model' input in the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'style_model' input in the StyleModelClamp node is comfy.sd.StyleModel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the StyleModelClamp node is 'style_model', which is the unmodified style model data, ensuring the integrity of the style model information as it passes through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the output in the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the output in the StyleModelClamp node is STYLE_MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the output in the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the output in the StyleModelClamp node is comfy.sd.StyleModel."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the StyleModelClamp node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the StyleModelClamp node is not an output node. It is indicated as 'Output node: False' in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the StyleModelClamp node?",
        "answer": "The category of the StyleModelClamp node is 'clamp'."
