        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Curve node is designed to visualize and analyze the curvature of keyframed paths, clearly indicating the smoothness and continuity in animations. It helps in understanding the trajectory and ensuring the motion is as intended, which is crucial for maintaining the desired aesthetics and fluidity in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfDebug_Curve node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfDebug_Curve node is 'curve_data', which holds the numerical data representing the curve to be debugged. It is essential as it forms the basis for visualization and analysis, enabling the node to effectively process and display the characteristics of the curve."
