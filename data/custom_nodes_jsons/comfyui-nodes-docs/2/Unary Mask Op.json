        "question": "What is the purpose of the UnaryMaskOp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnaryMaskOp node is designed to perform various unary operations on a given mask image, such as inverting the mask, averaging pixel values, rounding, clamping values to a certain range, and taking the absolute value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the UnaryMaskOp node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'op' (Comfy dtype: COMBO['invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', 'abs'], Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter represents the input mask image that will undergo a unary operation. The functionality of the node is directly related to the quality and format of this input, which affects the result of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter determine in the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter determines the specific unary operation that will be applied to the input mask, such as 'invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', or 'abs'. It is a crucial component as it dictates the type of transformation that will occur, affecting the final result of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the UnaryMaskOp node is 'result' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which encapsulates the result of the unary operation applied to the input mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the UnaryMaskOp node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available operations that can be performed on the input mask using the UnaryMaskOp node?",
        "answer": "The available operations that can be performed on the input mask using the UnaryMaskOp node are 'invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', and 'abs'."
