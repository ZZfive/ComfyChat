        "question": "What is the purpose of the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is used to preprocess input images using the MiDaS model to generate depth maps, which enhances the depth perception of the images for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input data source for depth estimation in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The main input data source for depth estimation in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node is the 'image' parameter, which is the input image used to generate the depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'a' parameter affect the depth estimation in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node is used to adjust the sensitivity of depth estimation, influencing the perception of distance and depth in the generated depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bg_threshold' parameter do in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'bg_threshold' parameter in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node sets the threshold for background separation, helping to differentiate between foreground and background elements in the depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node specifies the resolution of the generated depth map, affecting the level of detail and quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node is an image representing the depth map, where pixel intensity corresponds to the estimated depth from the camera's perspective."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is required for running the MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor node requires a GPU infra type for execution."
