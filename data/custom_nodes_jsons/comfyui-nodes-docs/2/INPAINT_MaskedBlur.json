        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskedBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskedBlur node is designed to fill missing or unwanted parts of an image using complex image inpainting techniques. It applies selective blurring to the masked areas, making them seamlessly blend with the surrounding image content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the MaskedBlur node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the MaskedBlur node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MaskedBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MaskedBlur node are 'image' and 'mask'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blur' parameter control in the MaskedBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' parameter controls the degree of blurring applied to the masked areas. It affects the smoothness of the transition between the filled areas and the rest of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'falloff' parameter determine in the MaskedBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'falloff' parameter determines the rate at which the blurring effect diminishes at the edges of the masked areas. It is used to create a more natural and gradual transition from the blurred to the unblurred regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskedBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskedBlur node is the 'output_image', which is the result of the image inpainting process. It contains the original image with the masked areas filled and blurred to match the surrounding regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what is the purpose of the 'make_odd()' function?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the 'make_odd()' function is used to ensure that the blur and falloff values are odd numbers. This is important for the proper functioning of the Gaussian blur and erosion operations."
