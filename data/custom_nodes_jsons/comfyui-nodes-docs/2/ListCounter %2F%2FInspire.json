        "question": "What is the purpose of the ListCounter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter node in ComfyUI is designed to incrementally count the occurrences of unique identifiers, providing a way to track events or items in a sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data structure does the ListCounter node use to maintain the count associated with each unique identifier?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter node uses a mapping structure to maintain the count associated with each unique identifier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'signal' parameter in the ListCounter node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' parameter in the ListCounter node represents the input that triggers the counting process. It signifies the event or item that needs to be counted and is crucial as it serves as the initiating factor for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'base_value' parameter play in the ListCounter node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_value' parameter in the ListCounter node serves as the initial count value before incrementing. It is important as it sets the foundation for the count and can be used to adjust the starting point of the sequence, providing flexibility in counting operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'unique_id' parameter contribute to the functionality of the ListCounter node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter in the ListCounter node is a key identifier used to distinguish between different sequences or items being tracked. It is crucial to the node's functionality as it allows for separate counting of each unique sequence or item."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output represent in the ListCounter node?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output in the ListCounter node reflects the current count value after the node processes the inputs. It indicates the total number of occurrences or events counted so far and provides insight into the progress of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ListCounter node use?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
