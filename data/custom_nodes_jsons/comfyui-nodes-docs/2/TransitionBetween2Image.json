        "question": "What is the purpose of the TransitionBetween2Image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TransitionBetween2Image node is used to generate a smooth transition between two images. It uses a Bezier curve for interpolation to generate a sequence of frames that morph one image into another."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the TransitionBetween2Image node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the TransitionBetween2Image node are: image_start (the starting image for the transition), image_end (the ending image for the transition), total_frames (the total number of frames to generate for the transition), begin_and_end_frames (the number of frames to copy at the beginning and end of the transition to provide a pausing effect), beiser_point_x (the x-coordinate of the control point on the Bezier curve that defines the shape of the transition), and beiser_point_y (the y-coordinate of the control point on the Bezier curve)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the TransitionBetween2Image node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the TransitionBetween2Image node is IMAGE, which represents the sequence of frames generated by the transition. The Python data type for this output is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TransitionBetween2Image node determine the size of the generated frames?",
        "answer": "The TransitionBetween2Image node calculates the size of the generated frames based on the dimensions of the starting and ending images. It takes into account the aspect ratio and determines the appropriate width and height to ensure a smooth transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the begin_and_end_frames parameter in the TransitionBetween2Image node?",
        "answer": "The begin_and_end_frames parameter specifies the number of frames to copy at the beginning and end of the transition. This provides a pausing effect, allowing the transition to momentarily hold on the starting and ending images before proceeding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TransitionBetween2Image node use the Bezier curve for interpolation?",
        "answer": "The TransitionBetween2Image node uses a Bezier curve defined by the control points (0,0), (beiser_point_x, beiser_point_y), and (1,1) for interpolation. It evaluates the curve at evenly spaced intervals based on the total number of frames to generate the intermediate frames of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type supported by the TransitionBetween2Image node?",
        "answer": "The TransitionBetween2Image node supports the CPU infra type, indicating that it can run on a CPU-based system."
