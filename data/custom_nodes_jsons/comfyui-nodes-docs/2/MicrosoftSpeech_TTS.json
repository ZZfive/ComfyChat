    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the voice parameter in the Text2AudioEdgeTts node?",
        "answer": "The voice parameter is crucial for determining the voice characteristics of the generated audio. It selects a specific voice from the predefined set of voices in the edge_tts library, which significantly influences the quality and tone of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the rate parameter in the Text2AudioEdgeTts node allow users to adjust?",
        "answer": "The rate parameter allows users to adjust the speed of speech. It can be set to a negative value to slow down the speech or a positive value to speed it up. This feature is important for fine-tuning the audio output to meet specific requirements or preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the filename_prefix parameter in the Text2AudioEdgeTts node?",
        "answer": "The filename_prefix parameter is used to create a unique identifier for the output audio file. It is particularly useful when organizing and managing multiple audio files, as it ensures each file has a unique and recognizable name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Text2AudioEdgeTts node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Text2AudioEdgeTts node is an MP3 file that contains the audio generated from the input text. This file is important as it represents the result of the node's text-to-speech conversion process and can be used in various downstream applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Text2AudioEdgeTts node use?",
        "answer": "The Text2AudioEdgeTts node uses CPU as the infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the source code provided for the Text2AudioEdgeTts node?",
        "answer": "The source code provided for the Text2AudioEdgeTts node defines the class and methods used to convert text to audio. It includes the initialization of the output directory, the definition of input and output types, and the main function 'text_2_audio' that generates the audio file using the edge_tts library."
