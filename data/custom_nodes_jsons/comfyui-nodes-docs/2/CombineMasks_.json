        "question": "What is the purpose of the CombineMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CombineMasks node in ComfyUI is designed to integrate multiple mask tensors into a single comprehensive mask, enhancing the representation of the underlying data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CombineMasks node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CombineMasks node are the input image, mask_1, and mask_2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the input image provide for the CombineMasks node?",
        "answer": "The input image is crucial as it serves as the foundational layer for the mask combination process, providing the spatial context needed for the node to correctly overlay and visualize masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the second mask in the CombineMasks node?",
        "answer": "The second mask adds an additional segmentation layer, helping to increase the complexity and detail of the combined mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the CombineMasks node?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the CombineMasks node is mask_3, which can further refine the segmentation by introducing finer-grained details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CombineMasks node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CombineMasks node are the Combined Mask, Heatmap Mask, and BW Mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Heatmap Mask output represent?",
        "answer": "The Heatmap Mask output visualizes the combined segmentation, offering a color representation that enhances the interpretability and analysis of the segmentation results."
