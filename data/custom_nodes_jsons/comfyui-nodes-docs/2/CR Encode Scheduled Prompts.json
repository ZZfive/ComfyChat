        "question": "What is the purpose of CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node is designed to manage the encoding of prompts in an animation sequence. It intelligently blends the current prompt and the next prompt based on specified weights to ensure smooth transitions between states, which is crucial for creating coherent and rich animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node are: clip (Comfy dtype: CLIP, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), current_prompt (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), next_prompt (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str), and weight (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight' parameter control in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node controls the blending of the current prompt and the next prompt. It directly influences the encoding process by determining the strength of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The output types of CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node are: CONDITIONING (Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING, Python dtype: List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]]) and show_help (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CONDITIONING output represent in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The CONDITIONING output in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node represents the encoded prompts ready for use in the animation. It is a crucial output as it provides the necessary data for subsequent animation steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' for CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' for CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the show_help output in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node provide?",
        "answer": "The show_help output in CR_EncodeScheduledPrompts node provides a URL link to the documentation for further assistance and understanding on how to effectively use the node."
