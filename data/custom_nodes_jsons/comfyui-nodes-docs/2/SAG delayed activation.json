        "question": "What is the purpose of the SAG delayed activation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAG delayed activation node introduces a custom implementation of Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) designed to enhance model performance by dynamically adjusting the attention mechanism based on conditional input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SAG delayed activation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SAG delayed activation node are: model (the neural network model to be modified), scale (a scaling factor adjusting the strength of the SAG effect), blur_sigma (the standard deviation for adversarial blurring), sigma_start (the starting value for sigma), and sigma_end (the ending value for sigma)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale' parameter in the SAG delayed activation node control?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter in the SAG delayed activation node is a scaling factor that adjusts the strength of the SAG effect, influencing the impact of the guidance on the model's attention mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SAG delayed activation node manipulate attention scores?",
        "answer": "The SAG delayed activation node manipulates attention scores by using adversarial blurring with a specified standard deviation (blur_sigma) and a threshold value, creating a degraded image which is then processed by the UNet to calculate the SAG effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SAG delayed activation node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SAG delayed activation node is a modified neural network model with an enhanced custom self-attention guidance implementation aimed at improving its performance by dynamically adjusting its attention mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the SAG delayed activation node belong?",
        "answer": "The SAG delayed activation node belongs to the 'model_patches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SAG delayed activation node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SAG delayed activation node is GPU."
