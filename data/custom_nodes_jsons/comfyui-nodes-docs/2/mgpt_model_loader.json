        "question": "What is the purpose of the mgpt_model_loader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_model_loader node in ComfyUI is responsible for loading and initializing a specified MotionGPT model with the given configuration and model weights. It sets up the necessary environment to ensure the model is ready for generating or processing motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the mgpt_model_loader node?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_model_loader node requires one input type: 'model', which specifies the MotionGPT model to be loaded and initialized for generation or processing. This parameter determines the specific MotionGPT model configuration and weights to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the mgpt_model_loader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the mgpt_model_loader node is 'mgpt_model', which represents the loaded and initialized MotionGPT model that can be used for generating or processing motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the specified model is not available locally?",
        "answer": "If the specified model is not available locally, the mgpt_model_loader node will download the model to the specified model path, ensuring that the model is available for use."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the mgpt_model_loader node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the mgpt_model_loader node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the mgpt_model_loader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_model_loader node belongs to the MotionDiff/mGPT category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is mgpt_model_loader an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, mgpt_model_loader is not an output node in ComfyUI."
