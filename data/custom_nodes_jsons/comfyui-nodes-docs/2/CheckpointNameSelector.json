    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the CheckpointNameSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the CheckpointNameSelector node is 'ckpt_name', which specifies the checkpoint name to be selected and is crucial for determining which checkpoint to use in subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CheckpointNameSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CheckpointNameSelector node are 'ckpt_name' and 'ckpt_name_str'. 'ckpt_name' returns the selected checkpoint name for further processing, while 'ckpt_name_str' provides the selected checkpoint name as a string for integration into workflows requiring text representation."

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the CheckpointNameSelector node to retrieve the checkpoint name?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointNameSelector node uses the 'get_ckpt_name' function to retrieve the checkpoint name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names for the CheckpointNameSelector node?",
        "answer": "The return types for the CheckpointNameSelector node are ('ckpt_name', 'ckpt_name_str'), and the return names are ('ckpt_name', 'ckpt_name_str')."
