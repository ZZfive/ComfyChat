        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_ConditioningBlend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_ConditioningBlend node is designed to seamlessly blend two conditioning inputs using a specified blending mode and intensity, ensuring a harmonious integration of the two inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_ConditioningBlend node are conditioning_a, conditioning_b, and blending_mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blending_mode parameter determine in the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The blending_mode parameter determines how the two conditioning inputs are combined. It is a crucial parameter as it dictates the algorithm used for blending, thus influencing the nature of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the blending_strength parameter play in the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The blending_strength parameter controls the intensity of the blending effect. It is important as it allows for fine-tuning the balance between the two conditioning inputs in the blend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the seed parameter in the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter is used within the node for random number generation. It helps maintain consistent random states during execution, ensuring reproducibility of results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_ConditioningBlend node is a single conditioning tensor representing the blended result of the two input conditioning tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_ConditioningBlend node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_ConditioningBlend node is CPU."
