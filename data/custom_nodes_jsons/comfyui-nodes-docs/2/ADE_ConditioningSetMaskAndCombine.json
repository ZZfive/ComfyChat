        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is to perform advanced conditioning data operations for the model, with a focus on applying masks and additional conditioning layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are cond (original conditioning data), cond_ADD (additional conditioning data to be combined), strength (scalar value determining the intensity of mask application), and set_cond_area (specifies the area in the conditioning data to modify)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node controls the intensity of the mask application on the conditioning data, determining the degree of influence of the additional conditioning and mask on the original data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are opt_mask (an optional mask that can be applied to the conditioning data), opt_lora_hook (an optional LoraHookGroup for further manipulation of the conditioning data), and opt_timesteps (optional timesteps for the conditioning operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is 'conditioning', which represents the enhanced or modified conditioning data after applying the additional conditioning layer, mask, and adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node use?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is classified in the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/single cond ops' category in ComfyUI."
