        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node is designed to efficiently merge multiple lists of strings into a single unified list, simplifying data preprocessing workflows, especially when dealing with text data from different sources that need to be aggregated for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'list_a' parameter in the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The 'list_a' parameter is a list of strings that will be merged with other lists. It is a fundamental input to the node as it directly contributes to the formation of the final merged list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the optional 'list_b' parameter in the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The 'list_b' parameter is an optional list of strings that can be concatenated with the main list. It enhances the flexibility of the node by allowing the inclusion of additional data in the final list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'list_c' parameter in the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'list_c' parameter provides further customization options for the node, allowing users to have more precise control over the composition of the output list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'list_d' parameter in the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The 'list_d' parameter is another optional list that can be concatenated to the merged list. It provides users with the ability to include even more strings, further customizing the final output based on specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node is a 'merged_list', which is the result of concatenating all input lists. It represents the combined text data that can be used for subsequent operations or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_List_Concatenate node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
