        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Refiner On_Off node in ComfyUI is designed to refine the input of XY plots based on a specified percentage, allowing dynamic adjustment of the refinement process to optimize efficiency and accuracy in data visualization or processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node is 'refine_at_percent', which specifies the percentage at which the refinement process should start, allowing precise control over when the refinement adjustment is applied to the XY plot."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'refine_at_percent' input in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'refine_at_percent' input uses the FLOAT data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'refine_at_percent' input in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the 'refine_at_percent' input uses the float data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node output?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Refiner On_Off node outputs a tuple containing the refinement type ('Refiner On/Off') and the corresponding XY value after applying the refinement at the specified percentage. This output is consistent with the expected 'X or Y' identifier, indicating that the X or Y value has been refined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type used by the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the XY Input: Refiner On_Off node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Refiner On_Off node is classified under the 'Efficiency Nodes/XY Inputs' category in ComfyUI."
