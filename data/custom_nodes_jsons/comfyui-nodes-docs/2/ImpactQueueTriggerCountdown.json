        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node in ComfyUI is designed to manage countdowns and trigger mechanisms in a queue system. It advances the count and decides whether to trigger an event based on the total count and the current mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node are 'count', 'total', and 'mode'. 'count' tracks the current position in the countdown sequence, 'total' defines the maximum count before triggering, and 'mode' determines whether the node should trigger an event."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node control?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is a boolean value that controls whether the node should trigger an event. It acts as an important switch for activating the countdown mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unique_id' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is used to identify the node in the system for feedback and queue management. It plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate communication and tracking within the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'signal' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' parameter in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is an optional input that can be used to pass additional information or control to the node. It provides flexibility for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node are 'signal_opt', 'count', and 'total'. 'signal_opt' allows the node to optionally pass a signal for further processing or communication, 'count' reflects the updated count after the node's operation, and 'total' provides the total count value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is CPU."
