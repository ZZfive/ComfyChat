    "question": "How are the output keyframes generated by `KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx8` related to the `frequency` input?",
    "answer": "The `frequency` parameter in `KfSinusoidalEntangledZeroOneFromFrequencyx8` affects the overall rate of oscillation for the eight curves it generates. A higher frequency will result in faster oscillations (quick periods and smaller peaks), while a lower frequency will cause the oscillations to become slower (longer periods and larger peaks). The detailed oscillation rate for each curve, including its period and amplitude, is directly influenced by the set frequency."
