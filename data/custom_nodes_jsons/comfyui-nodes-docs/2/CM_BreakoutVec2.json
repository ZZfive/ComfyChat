        "question": "What is the purpose of the BreakoutVec2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec2 node in ComfyUI is designed to decompose a 2D vector into its individual components, allowing access to the separate elements of a Vec2 object for further calculations or operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'a' parameter in the BreakoutVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the BreakoutVec2 node is a 2D vector that serves as the primary input for the node's operation. It is crucial as it determines the output of the node by being broken down into its constituent parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x' output represent in the BreakoutVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' output in the BreakoutVec2 node represents the first component of the input vector after it has been processed by the node. It is important because it allows for the separation and independent handling of vector elements, which can be critical in various mathematical and geometric computations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'y' output correspond to in the BreakoutVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'y' output in the BreakoutVec2 node corresponds to the second component of the input vector. It is equally important as the 'x' output and is applicable in applications that require separate manipulation or analysis of vector components, such as in graphics rendering or physical simulations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the BreakoutVec2 node use?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec2 node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'op' function in the BreakoutVec2 class?",
        "answer": "The 'op' function in the BreakoutVec2 class returns a tuple of two floats, representing the 'x' and 'y' components of the input vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the BreakoutVec2 node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BreakoutVec2 node belongs to the 'math/conversion' category in ComfyUI."
