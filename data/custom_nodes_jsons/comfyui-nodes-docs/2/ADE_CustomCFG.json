        "question": "What is the purpose of the CustomCFGNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CustomCFGNode is a custom control flow graph (CFG) node in ComfyUI used for creating animations and sampling settings. It allows users to define keyframes with specific multi-value configurations that determine the behavior of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the cfg_multival parameter in the CustomCFGNode?",
        "answer": "The cfg_multival parameter is crucial for defining the multi-value configuration of specific keyframes in an animation. It determines how the attributes of the keyframes influence the sampling process, which is essential for achieving the desired animation effects and controlling variability in the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CustomCFGNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CustomCFGNode is CUSTOM_CFG, which represents a customized group of keyframes used to control the sampling process. It encapsulates the multi-value configuration and its corresponding start percentage, allowing fine-grained control over the progress of the animation and the generation of different samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the CustomCFGNode?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the CustomCFGNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CustomCFGNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CustomCFGNode belongs to the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/sample settings' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CustomCFGNode an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the CustomCFGNode is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the CustomCFGNode to create the custom CFG?",
        "answer": "The CustomCFGNode uses the 'create_custom_cfg' function to create the custom CFG."
