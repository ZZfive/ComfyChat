        "question": "What is the purpose of the globalSeed class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The globalSeed class encapsulates the functionality of generating and managing random seeds for various operations within the system, ensuring a controlled and reproducible environment for experiments and model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'value' parameter in the globalSeed class?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter is crucial for specifying the initial seed value, which is important for ensuring the reproducibility of the system's random processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' parameter influence the seed generation in globalSeed?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter determines the control mechanism for seed generation, deciding whether the seed is set before or after the generation process, thereby affecting the overall randomness of the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'action' parameter in globalSeed?",
        "answer": "The 'action' parameter provides various seed operation strategies, allowing dynamic adjustment of the seed during system execution, which is essential for iterative or branching processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'last_seed' parameter provide in globalSeed?",
        "answer": "The 'last_seed' parameter serves as a reference for the most recently used seed, facilitating continuity and traceability in the system's randomization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output provide in the globalSeed class?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output provides a structured summary of the seed management operation, encapsulating the results of the randomization process and the applied settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the globalSeed class?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the globalSeed class is CPU."
