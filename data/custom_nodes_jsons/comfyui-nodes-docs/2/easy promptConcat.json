        "question": "What is the purpose of the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The promptConcat node is designed for easy and convenient text input concatenation, providing a simple method to combine multiple strings into a single output. It emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, making it ideal for scenarios where complex processing is not required."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs are required for the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The promptConcat node requires two inputs: prompt1 and prompt2. These inputs are essential as they define the initial and subsequent sections of the combined text output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the separator input for the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The separator input is used to insert a string between the two text inputs (prompt1 and prompt2) in the final output. This separates the combined text inputs and improves readability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected output type for the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The expected output type for the promptConcat node is a single string, representing the concatenated text from prompt1, prompt2, and the optional separator."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for the promptConcat node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the separator input in the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the separator input in the promptConcat node is an empty string, meaning no separator will be used between prompt1 and prompt2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the category and function of the promptConcat node?",
        "answer": "The promptConcat node belongs to the EasyUse/Prompt category and its function is 'concat_text'."
