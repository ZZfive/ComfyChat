        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Model_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to select between two models based on a boolean condition. It serves as a decision node in the workflow, directing the data flow towards either model_a or model_b depending on the boolean input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'model_a' represent in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "In the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node, the parameter 'model_a' represents the first model that the node can select. It is crucial for the decision process of the node as it determines one of the possible outcomes when the boolean condition is met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'model_b' represent in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "In the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node, the parameter 'model_b' represents the second model that the node can select. It plays an essential role in the decision process as it determines the alternative outcome when the boolean condition is not met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node acts as the switch that determines which model the node returns. It is important because it directly influences the output of the node and consequently affects the subsequent steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'selected_model' represent in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "In the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node, the output 'selected_model' represents the model chosen based on the boolean condition. It is a crucial output because it determines the subsequent processing steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Model_Input_Switch node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node determine which model to select in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node, the model selection is determined by the 'model_switch' function. If the 'boolean' parameter is true, it returns 'model_a', otherwise it returns 'model_b'."
