        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node in ComfyUI is used to extract the amplitude from a sinusoidal curve, providing a measure of the peak deviation of the curve from its mean value. This is crucial for understanding the strength of oscillations in the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node is 'curve', which represents the sinusoidal data structure from which the amplitude will be extracted. It is essential for the node's operation as it directly affects the output result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype does the 'curve' input parameter of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' input parameter of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node expects a Comfy dtype of SINUSOIDAL_CURVE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does the 'curve' input parameter of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' input parameter of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node expects a Python dtype of keyframed.SinusoidalCurve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node provide?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node provides the amplitude of the input sinusoidal curve as its output, indicating the range of its oscillations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype is used for the output of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The output of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node uses a Comfy dtype of FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is used for the output of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The output of KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node uses a Python dtype of float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node run on?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetAmplitude node runs on the CPU infra type."
