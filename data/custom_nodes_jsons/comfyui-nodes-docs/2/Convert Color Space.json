        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConvertColorSpace node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConvertColorSpace node is designed to convert images from one color space to another, providing a high-level interface for seamless conversion between RGB, HSV, and HSL color spaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ConvertColorSpace node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ConvertColorSpace node are 'in_space' (the current color space of the input image), 'out_space' (the desired color space for the output image), and 'image' (the input image data to be converted)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'in_space' parameter specify in the ConvertColorSpace node?",
        "answer": "The 'in_space' parameter defines the current color space of the input image, which is crucial for determining the appropriate conversion algorithm. It influences the execution of the node by specifying the starting point of the color space conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'out_space' parameter specify in the ConvertColorSpace node?",
        "answer": "The 'out_space' parameter specifies the desired color space for the output image. It is a key decision factor for the node's operation as it determines the target format of the color space conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ConvertColorSpace node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ConvertColorSpace node is 'IMAGE', which represents the converted image in the specified color space. It is the final result of the node's operation and is valuable for further image processing or analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ConvertColorSpace node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ConvertColorSpace node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ConvertColorSpace node handle the conversion between different color spaces?",
        "answer": "The ConvertColorSpace node first checks if the input and output color spaces are the same, in which case it returns the input image unchanged. If the color spaces are different, it converts the image to the RGB color space using the tensor2rgb function. It then converts the image to the HSV color space using either the rgb2hsv or hsl2hsv functions, depending on the input color space. Finally, it converts the image to the desired output color space using either the hsv2rgb or hsv2hsl functions, depending on the output color space."
