        "question": "What is the purpose of the samplerSDTurbo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The samplerSDTurbo node in ComfyUI is designed to efficiently generate high-quality images through advanced sampling techniques. It operates by transforming input data through a series of optimizations for both speed and visual fidelity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the samplerSDTurbo node include 'pipe', 'image_output', 'link_id', and 'save_prefix'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' parameter provide to the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' parameter provides the necessary data and settings for the sampling process in the samplerSDTurbo node, including model information, positive and negative examples, and other relevant configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'image_output' parameter affect the output of the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_output' parameter determines how the generated images are handled, offering flexibility in the way results are displayed or stored. Options include hiding, previewing, saving, or a combination thereof."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'link_id' parameter in the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The 'link_id' parameter is crucial for linking the generated image with the corresponding request or process, ensuring the correct image is associated with the correct task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'save_prefix' parameter in the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The 'save_prefix' parameter sets the prefix for saving image files, which is important for organizing and identifying the output. This prefix serves as a unique identifier for the images, aiding in their retrieval and management."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the samplerSDTurbo node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the samplerSDTurbo node are 'pipe' and 'image'. The 'pipe' output is a comprehensive structure containing the results of the sampling process, and the 'image' output contains the generated images."
