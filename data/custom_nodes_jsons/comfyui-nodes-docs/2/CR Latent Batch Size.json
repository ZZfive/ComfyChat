        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_LatentBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_LatentBatchSize node is designed to handle and manage batch sizes of latent representations. It efficiently processes duplicating and concatenating latent samples to reach the specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main input parameter for the CR_LatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The main input parameter for the CR_LatentBatchSize node is 'latent', which contains the latent representations that need to be batch processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the CR_LatentBatchSize node and what is its default value?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the CR_LatentBatchSize node is 'batch_size', which determines the number of samples in each batch. Its default value is 2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CR_LatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CR_LatentBatchSize node is 'samples', which is the concatenated latent representation tensor adjusted to match the desired batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the CR_LatentBatchSize node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the CR_LatentBatchSize node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the CR_LatentBatchSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the CR_LatentBatchSize node in ComfyUI is Comfyroll/Essential/Core."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batchsize' function in the CR_LatentBatchSize node do?",
        "answer": "The 'batchsize' function in the CR_LatentBatchSize node takes the latent samples, duplicates them to reach the specified batch size, and concatenates them into a single tensor."
