        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node in ComfyUI-SALT?",
        "answer": "The SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is used for advanced conditional control in audio and video scheduling tasks. It combines and applies masks to multiple conditional schedulings, allowing precise control over the conditioning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are positive_schedule_a, negative_schedule_a, positive_schedule_b, negative_schedule_b, mask_a, and mask_b."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are mask_strengths_a, mask_strengths_b, and set_cond_area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_strengths_a' input represent in the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_strengths_a' input represents a list of strengths applied to each mask for the first set of condition schedules, allowing variable influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is 'conditioning', which represents the conditioned schedules after being processed and combined with masks for subsequent audio and video generation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'set_cond_area' input affect the application of masks in the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'set_cond_area' input determines whether the condition area is set to default values or adjusted to mask boundaries, affecting how the masks are applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is 'CPU'."
