        "question": "What is the purpose of the FromListGet1Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Mask node is designed to retrieve a specific item from a mask list based on a given index. It supports random access, including accessing items from the end of the list using negative indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FromListGet1Mask node are 'list' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: List[torch.Tensor]) and 'index' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'list' input represent in the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'list' input represents the mask list from which an item will be retrieved. It is crucial for specifying on which list the operation should be performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'index' input represent in the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' input represents the index of the item to be retrieved from the list. It supports negative values for reverse access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FromListGet1Mask node is 'mask' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents the mask retrieved from the specified index in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FromListGet1Mask node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code for the FromListGet1Mask node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the FromListGet1Mask node is: ```python class FromListGet1Mask(metaclass=GetSingleFromListMeta): TYPE = \"MASK\" ```"
