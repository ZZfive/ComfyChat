        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskGrain class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskGrain class in ComfyUI is used to add noise to a mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the MaskGrain class?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MaskGrain class are: mask (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), grain (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and invert_mask (Comfy dtype: BOOLEAN, Python dtype: bool)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'grain' parameter control in the MaskGrain class?",
        "answer": "The 'grain' parameter in the MaskGrain class controls the intensity of the noise added to the mask."

    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert_mask' parameter do in the MaskGrain class?",
        "answer": "The 'invert_mask' parameter in the MaskGrain class determines whether to invert the mask before adding noise."
