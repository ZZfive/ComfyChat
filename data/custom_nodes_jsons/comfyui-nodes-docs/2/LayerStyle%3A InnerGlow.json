        "question": "How does the InnerGlow class handle the case when the layer_mask is not provided?",
        "answer": "If the layer_mask is not provided, the InnerGlow class checks if the layer image has an alpha channel. If it does, the alpha channel is used as the mask. If no suitable mask is found, an error message is logged, and the original background image is returned."
