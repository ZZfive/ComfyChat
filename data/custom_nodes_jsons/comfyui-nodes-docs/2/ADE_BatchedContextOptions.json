        "question": "What is the purpose of BatchedContextOptionsNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "BatchedContextOptionsNode is designed to manage and generate context options for animation sequences, providing a structured way to define the length, start percentage, and guaranteed steps for each context, ensuring coherence and efficiency in the animation workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for BatchedContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for BatchedContextOptionsNode is 'context_length', which specifies the duration of the context window. This is crucial for determining the range of each animation segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_percent' parameter in BatchedContextOptionsNode control?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter specifies the starting point of the context within the animation sequence, allowing fine-tuning of the initial focus of the animation. It plays a significant role in the overall animation strategy by controlling the starting position of each context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'guarantee_steps' parameter in BatchedContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'guarantee_steps' parameter ensures a minimum number of steps are processed for each context, providing protection against premature termination. It is important for maintaining the integrity of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'prev_context' parameter in BatchedContextOptionsNode contribute to the animation process?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_context' parameter allows for the continuation or modification of existing context options, enabling the node to build upon previous states. This is crucial for maintaining continuity in the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of BatchedContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of BatchedContextOptionsNode is 'CONTEXT_OPTS', which represents the collection of context options generated or updated by the node. These options are crucial for guiding subsequent steps in the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for BatchedContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for BatchedContextOptionsNode is CPU."
