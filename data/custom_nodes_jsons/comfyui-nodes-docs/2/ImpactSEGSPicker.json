        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSPicker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPicker node is designed to process and select segments from a series of segments. It simplifies the segment selection process and ensures that the output complies with specific requirements of the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SEGSPicker node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SEGSPicker node are 'picks', which is a string containing a comma-separated list of indexes corresponding to the segments to be selected, and 'segs', which is the collection of segment objects that the node will process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'picks' parameter in the SEGSPicker node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'picks' parameter in the SEGSPicker node specifies the segments to be selected. It is a string containing a comma-separated list of indexes corresponding to the segments to be processed and returned as output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the optional 'fallback_image_opt' parameter in the SEGSPicker node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'fallback_image_opt' parameter is an image that, if provided, the node will use to scale the segments. It influences the output of the node by ensuring that the size of the segments is appropriate for further processing or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SEGSPicker node return as output?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPicker node returns a new set of selected segments based on the selections received by the node. This is the final result of the node's processing and is important because it represents the final output for further use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSPicker node handle the scaling of segments when a fallback image is provided?",
        "answer": "When a fallback image is provided, the SEGSPicker node scales the segments to match the fallback image's shape. This is done to ensure that the segments are of appropriate size for further processing or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SEGSPicker node use?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPicker node uses the CPU as the infrastructure type."
