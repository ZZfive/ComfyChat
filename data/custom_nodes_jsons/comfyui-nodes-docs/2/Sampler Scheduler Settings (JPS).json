        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sampler Scheduler Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Scheduler Settings node in ComfyUI is designed to simplify the selection and configuration of samplers and schedulers in the generative pipeline, allowing users to specify and obtain settings for various sampling strategies and their corresponding scheduling algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Sampler Scheduler Settings node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Sampler Scheduler Settings node are 'sampler_name' and 'scheduler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sampler_name' input specify in the Sampler Scheduler Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' input in the Sampler Scheduler Settings node specifies the name of the sampler to be used, which plays a crucial role in determining the sampling strategy during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scheduler' input determine in the Sampler Scheduler Settings node?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' input in the Sampler Scheduler Settings node determines the scheduling algorithm to be applied, which directly affects the execution and efficiency of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Sampler Scheduler Settings node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Sampler Scheduler Settings node are 'sampler_name' and 'scheduler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Sampler Scheduler Settings node use?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Scheduler Settings node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Sampler Scheduler Settings node?",
        "answer": "The category of the Sampler Scheduler Settings node is 'JPS Nodes/Settings'."
