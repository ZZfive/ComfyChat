        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatRange node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange node in ComfyUI generates a series of floating-point numbers within a specified range, adjusting the interval based on user-defined parameters to facilitate various mathematical and computational tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FloatRange node are: start (FLOAT), stop (FLOAT), step (FLOAT), limit (INT), and ensure_end (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' parameter in the FloatRange node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter in the FloatRange node represents the starting value of the sequence. It sets the initial point for the node to begin generating numbers, which is crucial for defining the lower bound of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'limit' parameter in the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'limit' parameter in the FloatRange node specifies the maximum number of values to be generated. It restricts the total output, ensuring that the sequence does not exceed a predefined length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FloatRange node is a list of floating-point numbers (List[float]), representing the generated sequence within the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'ensure_end' parameter in the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The 'ensure_end' parameter in the FloatRange node is a flag that indicates whether to include the ending value in the sequence. When enabled, it affects the final output by ensuring that the sequence includes the specified stop value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange node uses the CPU as its infra type."
