        "question": "What is the purpose of the Bool node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Bool node in ComfyUI is designed to simply pass a boolean value, allowing logic operations or conditions to be applied based on its input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Bool node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Bool node is 'value', which represents the boolean input that directly determines the output. It serves as the basic logic unit for further operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'value' input in the Bool node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'value' input in the Bool node is BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'value' input in the Bool node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'value' input in the Bool node is bool."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Bool node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Bool node is BOOLEAN, which outputs the same boolean value as the input, helping with logical decision-making in the workflow."

        "question": "What is the infra type for the Bool node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Bool node is CPU."

        "question": "What is the category of the Bool node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Bool node in ComfyUI is Logic."
