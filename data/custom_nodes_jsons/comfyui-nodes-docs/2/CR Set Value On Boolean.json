        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_SetValueOnBoolean node is designed to assign a value based on the evaluation of a boolean condition. It provides a simple mechanism to return one of two values depending on whether the input boolean value is true or false, facilitating conditional logic in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'boolean' parameter in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter is crucial as it determines the flow of the node's logic. It decides which value will be returned based on its truthfulness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value_if_true' parameter define in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_if_true' parameter defines the value that will be returned when the 'boolean' parameter is evaluated as true. It plays a key role in the node's conditional output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value_if_false' parameter set in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_if_false' parameter sets the value that will be returned when the 'boolean' parameter is evaluated as false. It is essential for the node's alternative conditional output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INT' output represent in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'INT' output represents the integer value of either the 'value_if_true' or 'value_if_false' parameter, corresponding to the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FLOAT' output provide in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'FLOAT' output provides a floating-point representation of the returned value based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_help' output in the CR_SetValueOnBoolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output provides a URL link to the node's documentation for further guidance and information."
