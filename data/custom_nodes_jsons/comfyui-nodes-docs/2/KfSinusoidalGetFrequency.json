        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node in ComfyUI extracts the fundamental frequency from a sinusoidal curve, providing a measure of its oscillation rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node is 'curve', which is the data source for extracting the frequency. Its Comfy dtype is SINUSOIDAL_CURVE and Python dtype is kf.Keyframed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node is 'frequency', which represents the fundamental frequency of the input sinusoidal curve. Its Comfy dtype is FLOAT and Python dtype is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the KfSinusoidalGetFrequency node is CPU."
