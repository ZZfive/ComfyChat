        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node in ComfyUI is designed to extract the dimensions of an image, providing the width and height as outputs. It plays a key role in image processing tasks where the spatial dimensions of the image are crucial for further operations such as resizing, cropping, or data analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the GetImageSize node is an image parameter. This is essential for the node to determine the dimensions of the image. The node relies on this input to calculate and return the width and height of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the GetImageSize node are width and height. The width output provides the horizontal dimension of the processed image, and the height output represents the vertical dimension of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the width and height outputs in the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "In the GetImageSize node, the data type of both the width and height outputs is INT in ComfyUI, and in Python, it corresponds to the int data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the GetImageSize node use?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the GetImageSize node determine the width and height of an image?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node determines the width and height of an image by taking the image as input and using the image.size() function to get the image's size. It then extracts the width and height from this size information and returns them as outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the GetImageSize node belong?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node belongs to the Masquerade Nodes category in ComfyUI."
