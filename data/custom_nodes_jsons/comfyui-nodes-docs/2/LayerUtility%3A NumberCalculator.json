        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberCalculator class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberCalculator class in ComfyUI is used to perform boolean operations on two input numbers and output the result. It supports operations such as ==, !=, and, or, xor, not, min, and max."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the NumberCalculator class?",
        "answer": "The NumberCalculator class requires three inputs: 'a' (the first number), 'b' (the second number), and 'operator' (the operation to be performed). The inputs 'a' and 'b' can be of type BOOLEAN, INT, or FLOAT in Comfy, or bool, int, or float in Python. The 'operator' input is a STRING in Comfy or str in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the allowed values for the 'operator' input in the NumberCalculator class?",
        "answer": "The allowed values for the 'operator' input in the NumberCalculator class are: '==', '!=', 'and', 'or', 'xor', 'not(a)', 'min', and 'max'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the NumberCalculator class?",
        "answer": "The output type of the NumberCalculator class is BOOLEAN in Comfy or bool in Python, representing the result of the boolean operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the NumberCalculator class?",
        "answer": "The NumberCalculator class uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the NumberCalculator class perform the selected operation on the input numbers?",
        "answer": "In the 'number_calculator_node' function of the NumberCalculator class, a series of if statements are used to check the value of the 'operator' input. Based on the selected operator, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed on the input numbers 'a' and 'b', and the result is stored in the 'ret_value' variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types and names of the NumberCalculator class?",
        "answer": "The NumberCalculator class returns two values: an INT and a FLOAT, with the corresponding return names being 'int' and 'float'. The function returns a tuple containing the integer and float representations of the calculated result."
