        "question": "What is cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, cg-noise is a custom node that replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cg-noise node in ComfyUI generate variations?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise node in ComfyUI generates variations by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs and outputs of the cg-noise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The inputs of the cg-noise node in ComfyUI are `seed`, `variation_seed`, `weight`, `width`, and `height`. The outputs are `noise_image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the cg-noise node be used to add variations to an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the cg-noise node can be connected to the img2img node, with the `noise_image` output connected to the `noise_image` input of img2img. This allows adding variations to an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the seed and variation_seed inputs in the cg-noise node?",
        "answer": "In the cg-noise node, `seed` determines the base noise, while `variation_seed` is used to generate small variations from the base noise based on the `weight`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the weight input affect the noise generated by the cg-noise node?",
        "answer": "In the cg-noise node, the `weight` input controls the amount of influence the `variation_seed` has on the generated noise. A higher weight value gives more influence to the `variation_seed`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the cg-noise node in ComfyUI be used with other nodes besides img2img?",
        "answer": "Yes, the cg-noise node in ComfyUI can be used with other nodes that accept a `noise_image` input, not just the img2img node."
