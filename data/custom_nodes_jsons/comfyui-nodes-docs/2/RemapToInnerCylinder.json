        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapToInnerCylinder node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapToInnerCylinder node in ComfyUI applies a cylindrical remapping to the image, simulating the effect of viewing the image as if it were wrapped on the surface of an inner cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fov' parameter control in the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The 'fov' parameter, measured in degrees, determines the field of view which affects the curvature of the cylindrical projection. It influences how the image is stretched or compressed to fit the cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'swap_xy' parameter in the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_xy' parameter is a boolean flag. When set to true, it swaps the x and y axes of the image, changing the direction of the cylindrical projection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapToInnerCylinder node is the result of the cylindrical remapping, providing a transformed image as if viewed on the surface of an inner cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the RemapToInnerCylinder node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what format is the output of the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapToInnerCylinder node is in the format of a Dict[str, Any], with the key being 'remap' and the value being the result of the cylindrical remapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'fov' parameter in the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'fov' parameter in the RemapToInnerCylinder node is 90 degrees."
