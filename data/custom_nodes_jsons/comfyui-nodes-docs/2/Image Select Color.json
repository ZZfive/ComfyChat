        "question": "What is the primary function of the WAS_Image_Select_Color node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Select_Color node in ComfyUI is designed to process images by selecting pixels that match a specified color and its tolerance range, enhancing the image by focusing on the desired color range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Select_Color node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Select_Color node include an image parameter, which is essential for the node's operation as it determines the visual content to be analyzed and manipulated based on the specified color criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'red' parameter play in the WAS_Image_Select_Color node?",
        "answer": "The 'red' parameter in the WAS_Image_Select_Color node defines the red component of the color to be selected in the image. It plays a crucial role in determining the final visual outcome by specifying the range of red values to be considered."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'variance' parameter contribute to the functionality of the WAS_Image_Select_Color node?",
        "answer": "The 'variance' parameter in the WAS_Image_Select_Color node allows for flexibility in color selection by defining the acceptable range of color deviation. It is significant for accommodating minor variations in color intensity within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Select_Color node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Select_Color node is a selected image, which represents the processed image where only the pixels conforming to the specified color criteria are retained, reflecting the intended thematic focus."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Image_Select_Color node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Image_Select_Color node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Image_Select_Color node process the image to select the desired color?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Select_Color node processes the image by converting it to RGB mode and iterating through each pixel, comparing the RGB values of each pixel to the specified color and variance. If a pixel's RGB values fall within the specified range, it is included in the selected color image."
