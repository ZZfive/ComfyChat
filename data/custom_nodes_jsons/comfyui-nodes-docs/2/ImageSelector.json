        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node is designed to filter and select specific images from a given image set based on user-defined indexes. It supports selecting a single image or a range of images for custom image processing and operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageSelector node are 'images', which represents the image set to select from, and 'selected_indexes', which specifies the image indexes to select. The 'images' parameter has a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor, while the 'selected_indexes' parameter has a Comfy dtype of STRING and a Python dtype of str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageSelector node is 'image', which represents the filtered image set based on the specified indexes. It has a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ImageSelector node support selecting a range of images?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImageSelector node supports selecting a range of images. The 'selected_indexes' parameter allows specifying a range of indexes using a colon (':') separator, with the left index being inclusive and the right index being exclusive."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'selected_indexes' parameter in the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'selected_indexes' parameter in the ImageSelector node is '1,2,3', which selects the first three images from the input image set."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageSelector node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ImageSelector node is not an output node in ComfyUI. It is set to 'False' in the node configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The common node associated with the ImageSelector node is the 'Reroute' node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImageSelector node is 'GPU', indicating that it utilizes GPU resources for processing."
