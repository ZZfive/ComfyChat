        "question": "What is the purpose of the reactor class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The reactor class in ComfyUI is a comprehensive face manipulation toolkit designed to perform advanced face swapping and restoration operations on images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which deep learning model is used by reactor for face restoration?",
        "answer": "The reactor class utilizes the CodeFormer model for face restoration, which is a deep learning model that can enhance the quality of detected faces in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the face_restore_visibility parameter control in the reactor class?",
        "answer": "The face_restore_visibility parameter is a float value that controls the visibility of the restored face, where 1 means fully visible and 0.1 means almost invisible."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the codeformer_weight parameter affect face restoration in the reactor class?",
        "answer": "The codeformer_weight parameter applies a weight factor to the output of the CodeFormer model during face restoration, influencing the balance between the original facial features and the restored facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the detect_gender_input parameter in the reactor class?",
        "answer": "The detect_gender_input parameter allows the user to select the gender to be detected in the input face, which can affect the selection and processing of faces during the face swapping operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the input faces specified for processing in the reactor class?",
        "answer": "The input faces to be considered for processing are specified using the input_faces_index parameter, which is a string representing the index or multiple indices of the input faces, separated by commas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the console_log_level parameter control in the reactor class?",
        "answer": "The console_log_level parameter sets the verbosity of the console logs generated during the execution of the reactor node, with 0 indicating warnings, 1 indicating status messages, and 2 indicating detailed information."
