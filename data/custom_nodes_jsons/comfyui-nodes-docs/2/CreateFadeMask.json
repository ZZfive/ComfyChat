        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateFadeMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMask node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a series of gradient masks that smoothly transition from one opacity level to another, making it particularly suitable for visual effects and image processing applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node control?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node determines whether to invert the gradient mask, which is crucial for certain visual effects that require reversed opacity transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frames' parameter affect the output of the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' parameter specifies the number of frames in the sequence of gradient masks, directly influencing the duration and spacing of the gradient effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'midpoint_level' parameter play in the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'midpoint_level' parameter indicates the opacity level at the midpoint of the gradient mask sequence, helping to control the speed of the gradient at the center of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'midpoint_frame' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'midpoint_frame' parameter specifies the frame at which the midpoint of the gradient effect occurs, allowing for precise control over the timing of the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CreateFadeMask node utilize interpolation techniques?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMask node uses interpolation techniques such as 'linear', 'ease_in', 'ease_out', and 'ease_in_out' to create visually appealing gradient effects, significantly altering the appearance of transitions between opacity levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CreateFadeMask node is a series of gradient masks representing the opacity transition from the start level to the end level, created according to the specified parameters."
