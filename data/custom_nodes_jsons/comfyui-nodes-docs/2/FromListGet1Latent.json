        "question": "What is the purpose of the FromListGet1Latent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node is used to extract a single latent representation from a list of latent representations in ComfyUI. It simplifies the process of selecting a specific latent item from a collection of latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FromListGet1Latent node?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node requires two input types: 'list', which is the list of latent representations to extract from, and 'index', which is the index of the latent representation to extract from the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'list' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'list' input parameter is LATENT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'index' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'index' input parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the FromListGet1Latent node produce?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node outputs a single latent representation, which is the item extracted from the provided list based on the specified index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of the FromListGet1Latent node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of the FromListGet1Latent node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the FromListGet1Latent node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the FromListGet1Latent node is CPU."
