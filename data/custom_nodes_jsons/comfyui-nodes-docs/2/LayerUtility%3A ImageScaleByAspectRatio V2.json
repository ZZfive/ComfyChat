        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 class in ComfyUI is an upgraded version of ImageScaleByAspectRatio that allows scaling images and masks based on a target aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI are aspect_ratio, proportional_width, proportional_height, fit, method, round_to_multiple, scale_to_side, and scale_to_length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI are image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node in ComfyUI are image (scaled image), mask (scaled mask), original_size (original dimensions), width (target width), and height (target height)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node determine the target width and height?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node determines the target width and height based on the selected aspect ratio, scale_to_side parameter, and scale_to_length value. It calculates the dimensions to maintain the desired aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the round_to_multiple parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node?",
        "answer": "The round_to_multiple parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node allows rounding the target width and height to the nearest multiple of the specified value (8, 16, 32, 64, or None)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What sampling methods are available in the ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node for resizing images and masks?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleByAspectRatioV2 node supports various sampling methods for resizing images and masks, including lanczos, bicubic, hamming, bilinear, box, and nearest."
