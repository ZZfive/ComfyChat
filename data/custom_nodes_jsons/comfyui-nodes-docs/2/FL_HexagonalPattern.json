        "question": "What is the purpose of the FL_HexagonalPattern node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FL_HexagonalPattern node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a set of images into a hexagonal pattern, adjusting the size of the hexagons based on the image dimensions and optionally applying a shadow effect to enhance visual depth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FL_HexagonalPattern node is 'images', which is the set of images to be converted into a hexagonal pattern. Optional input types include 'hexagon_size', 'shadow_offset', 'shadow_color', 'background_color', 'rotation', and 'spacing'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'hexagon_size' parameter affect the output of the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The 'hexagon_size' parameter specifies the desired size of the hexagons in the pattern, influencing the overall appearance and level of detail of the hexagonal tiling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'shadow_offset' parameter do in the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The 'shadow_offset' parameter determines the offset distance of the shadow effect applied to each hexagon, enhancing the visual depth of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the background color of the output image be customized in the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The background color of the output image can be customized by setting the 'background_color' parameter in the FL_HexagonalPattern node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'rotation' parameter in the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The 'rotation' parameter controls the rotation angle of each hexagon in the pattern, providing an additional dimension of style customization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'spacing' parameter affect the hexagonal pattern in the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The 'spacing' parameter adjusts the spacing between individual hexagons in the pattern, affecting the density and overall aesthetic of the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FL_HexagonalPattern node is 'image', which is the converted image with the applied hexagonal pattern, including any specified shadow effects and background color."
