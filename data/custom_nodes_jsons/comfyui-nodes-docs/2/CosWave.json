        "question": "What is the purpose of the CosWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CosWave node in ComfyUI is used to generate cosine waveforms that can be adjusted using various parameters to achieve the desired transformations. It is mainly used to create oscillating effects that can be synchronized with time-based variables."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the phase parameter control in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter in the CosWave node determines the period of the cosine wave, affecting the frequency of oscillations. It is a key element in shaping the time characteristics of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the cosine wave in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter in the CosWave node sets the peak value of the wave, controlling the range of oscillations from its average position. It is crucial for defining the strength of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the x_translation and y_translation parameters in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "In the CosWave node, the x_translation parameter allows for horizontal movement of the waveform along the X-axis, providing control over the wave's position without affecting its shape. The y_translation parameter adjusts the vertical position of the wave along the Y-axis, allowing for fine-tuning of the wave's starting point."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the current_frame parameter used in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The current_frame parameter in the CosWave node is used to synchronize the wave's phase with the progress of a sequence or animation, allowing for dynamic changes over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the CosWave node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the CosWave node represents the resulting waveform value at a given frame, which can be used for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the int_output in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The int_output in the CosWave node is the integer version of the waveform value, which is useful for applications that require discrete values."
