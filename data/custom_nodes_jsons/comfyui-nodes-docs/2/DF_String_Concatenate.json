        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_String_Concatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_String_Concatenate node is designed to concatenate two strings together, with an optional delimiter. It creates a new string by appending one string to the end of another and inserting the specified delimiter in between."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the DF_String_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the DF_String_Concatenate node are 'Prepend', which is the string to be placed at the beginning of the concatenated string, and 'Append', which is the string to be appended to the end of the 'Prepend' string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Delimiter' parameter in the DF_String_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The 'Delimiter' parameter is an optional string that is used to separate the 'Prepend' and 'Append' strings in the concatenated result. It defines the character or sequence of characters that will be inserted between the two strings, affecting the overall format and readability of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the DF_String_Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The output of the DF_String_Concatenate node is the concatenated result string, which represents the combination of the 'Prepend' and 'Append' strings, possibly separated by the 'Delimiter'. It demonstrates the node's ability to effectively merge strings."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the DF_String_Concatenate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the DF_String_Concatenate node is 'Derfuu_Nodes/Functions/String Operations'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_String_Concatenate node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_String_Concatenate node is not an output node. It is indicated as 'False' in the documentation."
