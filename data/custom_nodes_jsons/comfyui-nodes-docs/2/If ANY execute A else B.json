        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI is used for conditional execution of two possible outputs based on a boolean input. It acts as a logical branch, allowing for dynamic flow control in a node-based execution environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the 'If ANY execute A else B' node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the 'If ANY execute A else B' node are 'ANY', 'IF_TRUE', and 'IF_FALSE'. 'ANY' is a boolean input that determines which of the two possible outputs to execute, while 'IF_TRUE' and 'IF_FALSE' represent the actions to be taken when the condition is satisfied or not satisfied, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node represents the result of executing either 'IF_TRUE' or 'IF_FALSE', depending on the evaluation of 'ANY'. The exact nature of this output is dynamic and reflects the conditional execution logic of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the 'If ANY execute A else B' node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the 'If ANY execute A else B' node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'If ANY execute A else B' node belongs to the 'Logic' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node is determined by the 'AlwaysEqualProxy(*)', which allows for dynamic output types based on the inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the 'If ANY execute A else B' node to determine the output?",
        "answer": "The 'If ANY execute A else B' node uses the 'return_based_on_bool' function to determine the output based on the boolean value of 'ANY'."
