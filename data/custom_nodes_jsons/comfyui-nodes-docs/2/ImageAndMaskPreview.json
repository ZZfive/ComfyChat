        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageAndMaskPreview node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageAndMaskPreview node are mask_opacity (FLOAT), mask_color (STRING), and pass_through (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the ImageAndMaskPreview node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the ImageAndMaskPreview node are image (IMAGE) and mask (MASK)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the pass_through input determine in the ImageAndMaskPreview node?",
        "answer": "The pass_through input in the ImageAndMaskPreview node determines whether to directly return the processed preview or save it to a file. When set to true, the preview is returned; otherwise, it is saved."

    {
        "question": "What output types does the ImageAndMaskPreview node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImageAndMaskPreview node produces two output types: composite (IMAGE) and ui. The composite output returns an image with the mask applied at the specified opacity and color adjustments when both an image and a mask are provided. The ui output provides a UI element displaying the results based on the inputs."

        "question": "How does the ImageAndMaskPreview node handle cases where only an image or mask is provided?",
        "answer": "If only an image is provided to the ImageAndMaskPreview node, it returns the image as the preview. If only a mask is provided, it converts the mask into a preview format."
