        "question": "What is the purpose of the AV_LLMApiConfig node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AV_LLMApiConfig node is designed to generate configuration settings for language model APIs, focusing on model selection, token limits, and temperature settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AV_LLMApiConfig node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AV_LLMApiConfig node are 'model', 'max_token', and 'temperature'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input type specify in the AV_LLMApiConfig node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input type specifies the language model to be used, allowing selection from a predefined list of GPT and Claude models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_token' input type define in the AV_LLMApiConfig node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_token' input type defines the maximum number of tokens that the language model can generate or process in a single request, setting a limit on the output length."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'temperature' input type affect the language model's behavior in the AV_LLMApiConfig node?",
        "answer": "The 'temperature' input type controls the creativity or randomness of the language model's responses. Higher values lead to more diverse outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AV_LLMApiConfig node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AV_LLMApiConfig node is 'llm_config', which encapsulates the model selection, token limit, and temperature setting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infratype does the AV_LLMApiConfig node use?",
        "answer": "The AV_LLMApiConfig node uses the 'CPU' infratype."
