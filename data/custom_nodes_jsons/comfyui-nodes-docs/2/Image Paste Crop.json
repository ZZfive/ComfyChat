        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node is designed to integrate and manipulate images by pasting a secondary image onto a primary image, then cropping and blending them seamlessly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node are the primary image (image), the secondary image to be pasted (crop_image), and the crop data defining the size and position of the cropping operation (crop_data)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters can be adjusted in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters that can be adjusted in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node are the blending amount between the images (crop_blending) and the sharpening level applied to the secondary image (crop_sharpening)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_blending parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node control?",
        "answer": "The crop_blending parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node controls the amount of blending between the primary and secondary images. Higher values result in a smoother transition, while lower values make the secondary image more pronounced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_sharpening parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node adjust?",
        "answer": "The crop_sharpening parameter in the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node adjusts the level of sharpening applied to the secondary image. Increasing this value can enhance image details, which is useful for making the pasted image clearer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node are the final processed image after pasting and cropping operations (result_image) and the mask generated by the cropping operation (result_mask)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Paste_Crop node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
