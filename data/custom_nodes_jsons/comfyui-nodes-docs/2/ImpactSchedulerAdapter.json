        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSchedulerAdapter node in ComfyUI is designed to adapt various scheduling strategies for tasks or processes, allowing dynamic selection and application of scheduling algorithms based on specific conditions or preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node are 'scheduler' and 'ays_scheduler'. The 'scheduler' input specifies the main scheduler to be used, while the 'ays_scheduler' input allows selecting an alternative scheduling strategy from a predefined list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node is 'scheduler', which represents the selected scheduler. It can be either the main scheduler or an alternative scheduler based on the provided conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImpactSchedulerAdapter node belong?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSchedulerAdapter node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute specify in the ImpactSchedulerAdapter class?",
        "answer": "The 'FUNCTION' attribute in the ImpactSchedulerAdapter class specifies the name of the method that executes the main functionality of the node, which is 'doit' in this case."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'doit' method in the ImpactSchedulerAdapter class do?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method in the ImpactSchedulerAdapter class takes the 'scheduler' and 'ays_scheduler' inputs and returns the selected scheduler based on the provided conditions. If 'ays_scheduler' is not 'None', it returns the 'ays_scheduler', otherwise, it returns the 'scheduler'."
