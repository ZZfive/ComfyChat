        "question": "What is the purpose of the Parabolize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Parabolize node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a parabolic transformation to an image, enhancing its visual features by adjusting its colors and contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Parabolize node achieve its effect on an image?",
        "answer": "The Parabolize node achieves its effect by applying a mathematical function that operates on pixel values based on given coefficient and vertex parameters, resulting in a stylized output suitable for various creative or analytical purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the Parabolize node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is the input image that the Parabolize node will process. It is crucial for the node's operation as it is the object of the parabolic transformation. The content and format of the image directly impact the outcome of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'coeff' parameter influence the Parabolize node's effect?",
        "answer": "The 'coeff' parameter determines the extent of the parabolic effect applied to the image. It is an optional parameter that allows users to control the intensity of the transformation, with a default value that provides a balanced effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'vertex_x' parameter play in the Parabolize node?",
        "answer": "The 'vertex_x' parameter specifies the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabolic function. It is an optional parameter that affects the position of the parabolic curve within the image, influencing the distribution of the transformed pixel values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'vertex_y' parameter affect the output of the Parabolize node?",
        "answer": "The 'vertex_y' parameter defines the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabolic function. It is an optional parameter that adjusts the vertical position of the parabolic curve, thus affecting the overall brightness of the transformed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'parabolized_image' output represent in the Parabolize node?",
        "answer": "The 'parabolized_image' output is the result of applying the parabolic transformation to the input image. It represents a new image with adjusted pixel values reflecting the effects of the selected coefficient and vertex parameters."
