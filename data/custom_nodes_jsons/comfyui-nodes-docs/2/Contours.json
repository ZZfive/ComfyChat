        "question": "What is the purpose of the Contours node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Contours node in ComfyUI is designed to identify and extract contours from an image based on specified retrieval and approximation modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Contours node preprocess the input image?",
        "answer": "The Contours node converts the input image to a grayscale version and applies thresholding if necessary before detecting contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Contours node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Contours node are an input image, a retrieval mode, and an approximation mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the retrieval mode specify in the Contours node?",
        "answer": "The retrieval mode in the Contours node specifies the organization or retrieval method of the contours, affecting the structure of the output contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the approximation mode affect the output contours in the Contours node?",
        "answer": "The approximation mode in the Contours node defines the method used to approximate the contours, influencing the level of detail and overall shape of the extracted contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Contours node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Contours node are cv_contours (a list of detected contours), cv_contour (a single contour selected from the list), and cv_contours_hierarchy (a hierarchical representation of the contours)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Contours node handle thresholding?",
        "answer": "The Contours node does not apply any thresholding itself. It expects the input image to be already thresholded before being passed to the node."
