        "question": "What is the purpose of the Repeat Into Grid (image) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (image) node tiles the input image samples into a configurable grid, effectively repeating the image in the specified number of rows and columns to create a larger, grid-like composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Repeat Into Grid (image) node are: image (the input image to be tiled into the grid), columns (the number of columns in the grid), and rows (the number of rows in the grid)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'columns' input specify in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The 'columns' input specifies the number of columns in the grid, determining how many times the input image will be repeated horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rows' input specify in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The 'rows' input specifies the number of rows in the grid, determining how many times the input image will be repeated vertically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Repeat Into Grid (image) node is a single image composed of the input image tiled according to the specified number of rows and columns, forming a grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Repeat Into Grid (image) node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Repeat Into Grid (image) node create the grid-like composite image?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (image) node creates the grid-like composite image by repeating the input image samples in the specified number of rows and columns, effectively tiling the input image into a configurable grid."
