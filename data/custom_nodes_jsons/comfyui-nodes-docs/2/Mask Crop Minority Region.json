        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node is designed to process input images or tensors representing masks and intelligently crop the minority regions within them. This is particularly useful for focusing on less prominent areas of an image for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node is 'masks', which can be a single mask or a stack of masks representing the areas of the image to be processed. The node will identify the minority regions in these masks and perform the cropping operation accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'padding' parameter do in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node?",
        "answer": "The 'padding' parameter allows users to specify the amount of padding to add around the cropped minority region. This is useful for preserving context around the cropped region or for seamless integration with other image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node is the cropped minority regions from the input masks, which can be used for further processing or analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node handle batches of masks?",
        "answer": "Yes, the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node can handle both single masks and batches of masks. If a batch of masks is provided, the node will process each mask individually and return a tensor containing all the cropped minority regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'padding' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'padding' parameter in the WAS_Mask_Crop_Minority_Region node is 24."
