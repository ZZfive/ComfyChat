        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactFloat node in ComfyUI is a basic processing unit designed to manipulate floating point numbers. Its 'doit' method is intended to handle numerical inputs in a precise manner, ensuring that the node's calculations are robust and reliable, which is crucial for mathematical operations and data analysis within the ImpactPack suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ImpactFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImpactFloat node is 'value', which is a floating point number. This parameter is essential for the node's functionality as it directly influences the result of the 'doit' method. This parameter is crucial for performing mathematical calculations and must be provided for the node to execute correctly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'doit' method in the ImpactFloat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'doit' method in the ImpactFloat node is a floating point number, which represents the processed result of the input 'value'. This output is important as it represents the result of the node's calculation and can be used for further analysis or as input for subsequent nodes in the workflow."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the ImpactFloat node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the ImpactFloat node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'value' parameter in the ImpactFloat node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'value' parameter in the ImpactFloat node is 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the minimum and maximum values for the 'value' parameter in the ImpactFloat node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the 'value' parameter in the ImpactFloat node is -3.402823466e+38, and the maximum value is 3.402823466e+38."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the ImpactFloat node's 'doit' method?",
        "answer": "The return type of the ImpactFloat node's 'doit' method is FLOAT, which represents a floating point number."
