        "question": "What is the purpose of the TriangleWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TriangleWave node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a triangular-shaped waveform by adjusting the amplitude and phase of a sine wave, which is useful for various signal processing applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'phase' parameter control in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter determines the period length of the waveform, affecting the frequency of the generated triangle wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'amplitude' parameter affect the triangle wave in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter sets the peak value of the triangle wave, which is a key factor in defining the overall shape and energy of the signal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'x_translation' parameter in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_translation' parameter moves the waveform along the X-axis, allowing for adjustments to the horizontal position of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'y_translation' parameter affect the triangle wave in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'y_translation' parameter moves the waveform along the Y-axis, affecting the vertical position of the starting point of the waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_frame' parameter specify in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter specifies the current position in the waveform sequence, which is crucial for the temporal evolution of the signal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'output' and 'int_output' parameters in the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'output' parameter represents the calculated value of the triangle wave for a given frame, while the 'int_output' parameter is an integer version of the wave value, which is useful for certain applications that require discrete values."
