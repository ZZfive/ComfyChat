        "question": "What is the purpose of the LutsStyler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LutsStyler node in ComfyUI applies stylistic transformations to text prompts based on a predefined collection of LUTs (Look-Up Tables), allowing users to customize the theme and aesthetic qualities of the prompts through various style filters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LutsStyler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LutsStyler node are: text_positive (positive text prompt to be stylized), text_negative (negative text prompt to be stylized), LUTs (specific Look-Up Table selection to be applied), and log_prompt (boolean flag controlling prompt transformation logging)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LUTs input affect the text prompts in the LutsStyler node?",
        "answer": "The LUTs input in the LutsStyler node determines the style filter used to transform the text prompts, directly influencing the final aesthetic and thematic output based on the selected Look-Up Table."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the log_prompt input do in the LutsStyler node?",
        "answer": "The log_prompt input in the LutsStyler node is a boolean flag that controls the logging of prompt transformations. When enabled, it provides visibility into the stylization process by outputting the original and transformed prompts, aiding in debugging and optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LutsStyler node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the LutsStyler node are text_positive (the transformed positive text prompt after stylization based on the selected LUT) and text_negative (the transformed negative text prompt after stylization using the selected LUT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the LutsStyler node use?",
        "answer": "The LutsStyler node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the source code for the LutsStyler node available in the documentation?",
        "answer": "No, the source code for the LutsStyler node could not be found in the provided documentation, making it unable to automatically detect the source code."
