        "question": "What is the purpose of the Vec4BinaryOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Vec4BinaryOperation node in ComfyUI is designed to perform binary operations on two four-dimensional vectors (Vec4). It handles various operations specified by the 'op' parameter, allowing for element-wise operations between vectors 'a' and 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' parameter in Vec4BinaryOperation specify?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in Vec4BinaryOperation specifies the type of binary operation to be performed on the input vectors. It determines the mathematical function applied to the vectors, thus affecting the result of the node's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of parameter 'a' in Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "Parameter 'a' in Vec4BinaryOperation represents the first four-dimensional vector (Vec4) in the binary operation. It plays a crucial role as it is one of the operands in the vector operation, directly influencing the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does parameter 'b' play in Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "Parameter 'b' in Vec4BinaryOperation signifies the second four-dimensional vector (Vec4) involved in the binary operation. It is important as it is the second operand in the vector operation, affecting the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' parameter in Vec4BinaryOperation represent?",
        "answer": "The 'result' parameter in Vec4BinaryOperation holds the result of the binary operation performed between input vectors 'a' and 'b'. It is significant as it represents the final computed vector after the operation has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The infra type for Vec4BinaryOperation is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the binary operation actually performed in the source code of Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "In the source code of Vec4BinaryOperation, the binary operation is performed using the function `VEC_BINARY_OPERATIONS[op](numpy.array(a), numpy.array(b))`, which applies the specified operation 'op' on the numpy arrays of vectors 'a' and 'b'."
