        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Blend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Blend node in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly blend two images together using the 'image_blend' method. It creates a visually harmonious composite image that reflects a balance between the input images by controlling the degree of blending with the blend_percentage parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WAS_Image_Blend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WAS_Image_Blend node are 'image_a' and 'image_b', both of which are of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype PIL.Image.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blend_percentage' parameter in the WAS_Image_Blend node control?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_percentage' parameter in the WAS_Image_Blend node determines the visibility of 'image_b' in the final blend. It is a float value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means only 'image_a' is visible and 1.0 means only 'image_b' is visible."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Blend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Blend node is 'image', which is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor. It represents the blended image that visually combines elements from the two input images based on the specified 'blend_percentage'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Image_Blend node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Blend node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Image_Blend node blend two images together in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the WAS_Image_Blend node blends two images by first converting them from tensors to PIL images, creating a blend mask based on the 'blend_percentage', inverting the blend mask, and then using Image.composite to combine the two images using the blend mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'blend_percentage' parameter in the WAS_Image_Blend node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'blend_percentage' parameter in the WAS_Image_Blend node is 0.5."
