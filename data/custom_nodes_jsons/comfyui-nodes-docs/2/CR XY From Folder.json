        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_XYFromFolder node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYFromFolder node is designed to process and organize images from a specified folder into a grid layout, allowing users to add annotations, set font sizes, and control the spacing between images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image_folder' parameter in the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_folder' parameter is crucial for defining the source from which images will be organized into the grid, determining the directory from which the node retrieves and processes images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_index' parameter affect the image selection process in the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_index' parameter determines the starting point for the image selection process, allowing control over which images are included in the grid by specifying a particular position to begin from."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'max_columns' parameter play in the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_columns' parameter defines the number of columns in the grid, playing a crucial role in structuring the grid and ensuring a visually balanced layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'x_annotation' and 'y_annotation' parameters contribute to the functionality of the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_annotation' and 'y_annotation' parameters are used to provide annotations for the columns and rows of the grid, respectively, adding a layer of information and context to the visual representation of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'gap' parameter in the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'gap' parameter defines the spacing between images in the grid, contributing to the overall visual presentation and ensuring that images do not appear too crowded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the CR_XYFromFolder node produce?",
        "answer": "The CR_XYFromFolder node produces three outputs: an IMAGE output providing the final annotated grid of images, a trigger output indicating whether the node's operation was executed based on the input trigger, and a show_help output offering a URL link to the node's documentation page for additional information and guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'trigger' parameter control the execution of the image processing and grid creation in the CR_XYFromFolder node?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger' parameter acts as an optional switch that, when activated, initiates the image processing and grid creation, providing a means to control when the node's operations are performed."
