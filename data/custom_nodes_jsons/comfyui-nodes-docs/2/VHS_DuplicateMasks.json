        "question": "What is the purpose of the DuplicateMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DuplicateMasks node in ComfyUI is designed to copy a given mask to a specified number of instances. Its function is to amplify the input mask, creating multiple copies that can be used in video processing tasks that require multiple identical masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The key required input for the DuplicateMasks node is the 'mask' parameter, which represents the mask that needs to be copied. This is crucial for the node's operation and final results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiply_by' parameter in the DuplicateMasks node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'multiply_by' parameter in the DuplicateMasks node determines the number of times the input mask should be copied. It directly affects the quantity of output masks, with a default value of 1, meaning that if not specified, the node will produce a single instance of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The DuplicateMasks node has two output types: 'MASK' and 'count'. 'MASK' is a tensor that contains the copied masks, representing the collective result of the duplication process. 'count' is an integer that provides the total number of copied masks generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output in the DuplicateMasks node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output in the DuplicateMasks node represents the total number of copied masks generated. It is an integer that indicates the quantity of masks in the 'MASK' output, providing insight into the scale of the duplication performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the DuplicateMasks node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DuplicateMasks node perform the duplication of masks in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the DuplicateMasks node performs the duplication by iterating 'multiply_by' times and appending the input mask to a list ('full_masks'). It then concatenates these masks into a single tensor ('new_mask') using 'torch.cat' and returns both this tensor and its size along dimension 0."
