        "question": "What is the purpose of the Metadata comparator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Metadata comparator node in ComfyUI is designed to compare two sets of metadata to identify differences and similarities between them. It abstracts the complexity of metadata comparison and provides insights into how metadata evolves over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Metadata comparator node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Metadata comparator node are: metadata_raw_old (the old set of metadata to compare), metadata_raw_new (the new set of metadata to compare against the old set), and what (specifies the type of comparison to perform)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'what' parameter specify in the Metadata comparator node?",
        "answer": "The 'what' parameter in the Metadata comparator node specifies the type of comparison to perform, which influences the execution of the node and the nature of the comparison results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Metadata comparator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Metadata comparator node is JSON, which represents the result of the comparison detailing the differences and similarities between the two sets of metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the Metadata comparator node have any optional input types?",
        "answer": "No, the Metadata comparator node does not have any optional input types. It only requires the three mandatory input types: metadata_raw_old, metadata_raw_new, and what."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Metadata comparator node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Metadata comparator node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Metadata comparator node do if the provided metadata sets are not dictionaries?",
        "answer": "If the provided metadata sets are not dictionaries, the Metadata comparator node logs a warning message and returns an invalid metadata message as the result."
