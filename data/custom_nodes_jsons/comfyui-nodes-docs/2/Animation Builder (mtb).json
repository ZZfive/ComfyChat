        "question": "Which programming language can be used to build custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The specific content does not directly answer this question, but based on general knowledge, custom nodes and plugins for ComfyUI can be developed using Python, which is a commonly used language for machine learning and image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key components required for developing custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The specific content details that custom nodes can be composed of different operators, CIFG (Controlled Input Flow Graph) components, custom scripts, global settings, and control custom nodes and micro nodes. These components are essential for creating custom functionality within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI be configured to allow for real-time adjustments?",
        "answer": "The specific content does not contain this information, but a typical method might involve integrating event-driven programming to respond to user input or changes in the image/video processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between a custom script and a control custom node?",
        "answer": "Based on the content, a custom script allows for dynamic control over a node through the use of a KDFG and KDG, whereas a control custom node allows for adjusting node functionality without executing a script."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the global setting play in custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The content mentions that global settings can be used to control how custom nodes handle real-time updates. Therefore, global settings are crucial for enabling real-time features and controlling the behavior of custom nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI be used in collaboration with existing nodes?",
        "answer": "The content mentions the concept of node composition, which suggests that custom nodes can often be combined with existing nodes to extend their functionality. Therefore, collaboration between custom nodes and existing nodes is a common practice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of including a micro node in a custom node?",
        "answer": "The specific content does not address this question, but in general, a micro node can be included in a custom node to handle simpler tasks or to be used as a building block for more complex tasks within the larger custom node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the signature in custom nodes?",
        "answer": "The content does not provide details on this, but the signature typically determines how a custom node will interact with other nodes in the graph, including how inputs and outputs are structured."
