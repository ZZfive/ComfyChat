        "question": "What does the LoadMotionBrushFromOpticalFlowDirectory class do?",
        "answer": "The LoadMotionBrushFromOpticalFlowDirectory class loads motion brush data from a specified optical flow directory using a defined model. This allows for the extraction of motion data from given light flow files, which can then be used to generate motion brushes for various applications such as animation, video editing, and effects generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"model\" parameter?",
        "answer": "The \"model\" parameter is crucial as it determines the specific algorithm or framework that ComfyUI uses to handle optical flow data. This influences the accuracy and efficiency with which motion brushes are generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the \"model\" parameter's Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in ComfyUI has a dtype of 'DragNUWA'. This indicates that the model is designed for the DragNUWA category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"optical_flow_directory\" parameter?",
        "answer": "The \"optical_flow_directory\" parameter specifies the directory that contains the optical flow files. This directory is essential for the node to locate and process the motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the \"optical_flow_directory\" parameter's Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "The 'optical_flow_directory' parameter in ComfyUI is of type 'STRING'. This means it expects a string value containing the directory path."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of the LoadMotionBrushFromOpticalFlowDirectory class?",
        "answer": "The class does not have an output node but returns a motif brush as a tensor of type 'torch.Tensor'. This tensor represents the motion brush data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the motion brush?",
        "answer": "The motion brush output is of type 'torch.Tensor'. This data type is commonly used in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch for efficient numerical computations."
