        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadInpaintModel class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadInpaintModel class in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the loading of inpainting models, which are specialized neural network architectures used to fill in missing or damaged parts of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model_name' parameter in the LoadInpaintModel class?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' parameter is crucial as it identifies the specific inpainting model to be loaded. It influences the execution of the node by determining the neural network architecture that will be used for the inpainting task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'INPAINT_MODEL' represent in the LoadInpaintModel class?",
        "answer": "The output 'INPAINT_MODEL' represents the loaded inpainting model that is ready for use in subsequent image processing tasks. It encapsulates the trained weights and architecture of the model, marking the completion of the loading process and enabling the model to perform its designated function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the LoadInpaintModel class?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the LoadInpaintModel class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadInpaintModel class handle different model file types?",
        "answer": "The LoadInpaintModel class handles different model file types by checking the file extension. If the file ends with '.pt', it loads the model using `torch.jit.load`. Otherwise, it uses `comfy.utils.load_torch_file` to load the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LoadInpaintModel class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LoadInpaintModel class in ComfyUI is 'inpaint'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the LoadInpaintModel class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the LoadInpaintModel class is 'INPAINT_MODEL', which is of type `torch.nn.Module`."
