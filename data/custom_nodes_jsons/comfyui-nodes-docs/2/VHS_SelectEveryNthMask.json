        "question": "What is the purpose of the SelectEveryNthMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SelectEveryNthMask node in ComfyUI is designed to process a sequence of masks by selecting every nth mask from the input. This is crucial for applications that require further processing or analysis on a subset of masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SelectEveryNthMask node are 'mask', which is the sequence of masks the node will process, and 'select_every_nth', which determines the frequency of selecting masks from the input sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select_every_nth' parameter in the SelectEveryNthMask node control?",
        "answer": "The 'select_every_nth' parameter in the SelectEveryNthMask node controls the interval at which masks are selected from the input sequence. It significantly influences the node's output as it controls the density of the returned sequence of masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SelectEveryNthMask node are 'MASK' and 'count'. 'MASK' is a subset of the input masks selected based on the specified interval, and 'count' is the number of masks selected from the input sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output in the SelectEveryNthMask node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output in the SelectEveryNthMask node represents the number of masks selected from the input sequence. It indicates the efficiency of the selection process and can be used for further analysis or to inform subsequent steps in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for the SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SelectEveryNthMask node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select_masks' method in the SelectEveryNthMask node do?",
        "answer": "The 'select_masks' method in the SelectEveryNthMask node selects every nth mask from the input sequence based on the 'select_every_nth' parameter. It returns a tuple containing the selected subset of masks and the count of selected masks."
