        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentComposite node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentComposite node in ComfyUI is used to blend two different sets of latent samples, allowing one set to be seamlessly integrated into the other based on specified coordinates and blending method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the LatentComposite node are 'samples_to', 'samples_from', 'x', and 'y'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples_to' parameter represent in the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples_to' parameter represents the base latent sample into which the 'samples_from' will be composited. It is crucial as it determines the structure and dimensions of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x' parameter specify in the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' parameter specifies the horizontal starting coordinate for the compositing operation, directly influencing where the 'samples_from' will be placed within the 'samples_to'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'feather' parameter in the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The 'feather' parameter controls the smoothness of the edges in the compositing operation. Non-zero values produce a feathered or graduated transition between the two sets of samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentComposite node is 'samples_out', which represents the resulting latent samples merged from 'samples_to' and 'samples_from'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LatentComposite node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the LatentComposite node is CPU."
