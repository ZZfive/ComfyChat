        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioTrebleBoost node is used to enhance the high-frequency components of an audio input, allowing users to customize the extent to which higher frequency ranges are boosted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node are 'audio', which is the raw audio data to be processed, 'cutoff_freq', which specifies the frequency threshold above which the high frequencies will be boosted, and 'boost_dB', which controls the gain level applied to the high frequencies above the cutoff point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node is audio, specifically the processed audio that has undergone high-frequency enhancement reflecting the applied high-pass filter and gain adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'cutoff_freq' parameter affect the audio processing in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff_freq' parameter plays a crucial role in defining the frequency range affected by the high-frequency boost. It specifies the threshold above which frequencies will be enhanced, thereby influencing the overall tonal characteristics of the sound."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boost_dB' parameter in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost_dB' parameter directly controls the intensity of the high-frequency enhancement. It determines the gain level applied to the frequencies above the cutoff point, allowing for a range of audio modifications from subtle to pronounced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the source code provided for the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The source code provided for the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node defines the class and methods for processing audio input to enhance high frequencies. It includes the class definition, input and output type specifications, and the main processing function 'treble_bass' that applies a high-pass filter and gain adjustment to the audio."
