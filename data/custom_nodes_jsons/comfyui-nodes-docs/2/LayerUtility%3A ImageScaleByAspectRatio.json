        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class in ComfyUI is to scale an image or mask according to a specified aspect ratio. It provides options to set the target aspect ratio, fit mode, scaling method, rounding to multiples, and scaling to the longest side."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class are: aspect_ratio, proportional_width, proportional_height, fit, method, round_to_multiple, scale_to_longest_side, and longest_side."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameters for the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class are: image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available fit modes in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class?",
        "answer": "The available fit modes in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class are: letterbox, crop, and fill."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class are: scaled image (IMAGE), scaled mask (MASK), original size (BOX), target width (INT), and target height (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class handle the case when both image and mask inputs are provided?",
        "answer": "When both image and mask inputs are provided, the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class checks if their dimensions match. If they don't match, an error is logged, and the function returns None for all output values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the round_to_multiple parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class?",
        "answer": "The round_to_multiple parameter in the ImageScaleByAspectRatio class is used to round the target width and height to the nearest multiple of the specified value (8, 16, 32, 64, or None)."
