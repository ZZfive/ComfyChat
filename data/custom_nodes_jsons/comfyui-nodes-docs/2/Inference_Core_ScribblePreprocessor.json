        "question": "What is the purpose of the ScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to pre-process images to detect and extract scribble lines. It uses specialized models to process the input image, enhancing or separating scribble-like features, suitable for applications that require line extraction or artistic effect enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ScribblePreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image that needs to be processed for scribble line detection and extraction. This parameter is crucial for defining the visual content that the model will analyze and manipulate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the ScribblePreprocessor node is 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to scale the input image before processing. Higher resolutions may result in more detailed scribble line detection but may increase computation time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ScribblePreprocessor node is the 'image', which is the processed image where scribble lines are detected and enhanced or separated, suitable for further artistic or analytical applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ScribblePreprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ScribblePreprocessor node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node falls under the category of 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ScribblePreprocessor node process the input image?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node processes the input image using the ScribbleDetector model. It executes the model on the input image, scales it to the specified resolution, and returns the processed image with enhanced or separated scribble lines."
