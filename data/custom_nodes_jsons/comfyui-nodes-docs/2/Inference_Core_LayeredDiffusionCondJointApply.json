        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node is used to apply conditional and joint layered diffusion processes to generate or manipulate images based on a set of conditions and joint configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node are 'model', 'image', and 'config'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input represents the model patcher used to apply layered diffusion techniques, which is crucial for integrating with the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'image' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input serves as the target image for the diffusion process, acting as the basis for transformation or synthesis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'config' input specify in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'config' input specifies the configuration string that determines the use of specific layered diffusion models and settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node are 'cond' and 'blended_cond'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node is 'model', which represents the model after applying the layered diffusion process, equipped with modifications for image synthesis or transformation."
