        "question": "What is the purpose of the KfDebug_Vae node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KfDebug_Vae node in ComfyUI is used for analyzing and visualizing the performance and behavior of variational autoencoder (VAE) models, providing insights into the generation process and the structure of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the KfDebug_Vae node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the KfDebug_Vae node is 'image'. It is crucial for the node to process and analyze data, enabling the visualization of the VAE's reconstruction and generation capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the KfDebug_Vae node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the KfDebug_Vae node is 'latent_codes'. It allows users to input specific latent codes to explore and manipulate the images generated by the VAE, providing a deeper understanding of the model's latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the KfDebug_Vae node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the KfDebug_Vae node are 'reconstructed_images' and 'generated_images'. 'reconstructed_images' displays the images reconstructed by the VAE, providing a direct comparison with the original input and an assessment of the model's performance. 'generated_images' represents the node's ability to generate new data points from the learned latent space, showcasing the VAE's generative capabilities."

    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' for the KfDebug_Vae node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' for the KfDebug_Vae node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the parent class of KfDebug_Vae?",
        "answer": "The parent class of KfDebug_Vae is KfDebug_Passthrough."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the KfDebug_Vae node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the KfDebug_Vae node is 'VAE'."
