        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactCompare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node is designed to evaluate and compare two inputs 'a' and 'b' based on a specified comparison operator, returning a boolean result corresponding to the comparison made."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cmp' parameter define in the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The 'cmp' parameter defines the type of comparison to be made between inputs 'a' and 'b'. It is crucial as it determines the logic applied to the comparison and directly influences the result of the node execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the 'cmp' parameter in the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the 'cmp' parameter are: 'a = b', 'a <> b', 'a > b', 'a < b', 'a >= b', 'a <= b', 'tt', 'ff'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' parameter represent in the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter represents the first operand in the comparison. Its value and data type can significantly affect the execution of the node and the boolean result returned by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' parameter represent in the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The 'b' parameter is the second operand in the comparison. It works together with 'a' to determine the final boolean result based on the specified comparison operator."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactCompare node is 'result', which reflects the result of the comparison between 'a' and 'b' as a boolean value. It is important as it is the direct output of the node's logical operation and is used to inform subsequent processes or decisions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactCompare node use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
