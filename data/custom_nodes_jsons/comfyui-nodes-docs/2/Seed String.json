        "question": "What is the purpose of the IntegerAndString node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntegerAndString node in ComfyUI is designed to convert an integer input into its corresponding string representation, making numerical data more human-readable and suitable for operations that require string manipulation or interaction between numerical and textual data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'seed' parameter in the IntegerAndString node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is crucial for the IntegerAndString node because it represents the initial integer value that will be converted into a string. This parameter plays a key role in determining the output, as the node's functionality revolves around this conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IntegerAndString node?",
        "answer": "The IntegerAndString node has two output types: 'seed' (INT) and 'seed_string' (STRING). The 'seed' output represents the original integer value provided to the node, while the 'seed_string' output is the string representation of the input integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the IntegerAndString node?",
        "answer": "The IntegerAndString node uses the CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the IntegerAndString node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IntegerAndString node belongs to the 'Mikey/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'seed' parameter in the IntegerAndString node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'seed' parameter in the IntegerAndString node is 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the minimum and maximum values allowed for the 'seed' parameter in the IntegerAndString node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value allowed for the 'seed' parameter in the IntegerAndString node is 0, and the maximum value is 18446744073709551615."
