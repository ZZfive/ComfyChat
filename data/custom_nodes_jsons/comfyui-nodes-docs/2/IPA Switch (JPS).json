        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPA Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPA Switch node is designed to select and output one of multiple IP Adapter configurations based on a given selection input, enabling dynamic switching between different IP Adapter settings to flexibly adapt to various needs in the processing flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the IPA Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the IPA Switch node is 'select', which is an integer value that determines which IP Adapter configuration to output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the IPA Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the IPA Switch node are 'ipa_1' to 'ipa_5', representing a series of selectable IP Adapter configurations. 'ipa_1' is required, while the others are optional, allowing dynamic selection based on 'select'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the IPA Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IPA Switch node is 'IPA_out', which is the selected IP Adapter configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the IPA Switch node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the IPA Switch node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IPA Switch node determine which IP Adapter configuration to output?",
        "answer": "The IPA Switch node determines which IP Adapter configuration to output based on the value of the 'select' input. If 'select' is 2, it outputs 'ipa_2', if 'select' is 3, it outputs 'ipa_3', and so on, with 'ipa_1' being the default output."
