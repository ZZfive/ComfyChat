        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Images_To_RGB node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Images_To_RGB node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a series of images into their RGB representations. It operates by converting each image to a tensor, then converting it to an RGB format, and finally, if multiple images are provided, stacking the resulting tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial for the operation of the WAS_Images_To_RGB node as it represents the collection of images that need to be converted to RGB format. The node processes each image individually and ensures the final output is a tensor representation suitable for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Images_To_RGB node is a tensor or a stack of tensors representing the RGB format of the input images. This output is important as it allows for seamless integration with other nodes in the WAS suite that require RGB image data for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the WAS_Images_To_RGB node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if more than one image is provided to the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "If more than one image is provided to the WAS_Images_To_RGB node, each image is converted to a tensor and then to RGB format. The resulting tensors are then stacked together to form a single output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if only one image is provided to the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "If only one image is provided to the WAS_Images_To_RGB node, it is converted to a tensor and then to RGB format, and the resulting tensor is directly returned as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'image_to_rgb' method in the WAS_Images_To_RGB node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_to_rgb' method in the WAS_Images_To_RGB node converts the input images to their RGB representations. This involves converting each image to a tensor, then converting it to RGB format, and stacking the tensors if multiple images are provided."
