        "question": "What is the purpose of the RelightSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RelightSimple node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the lighting of an image based on the provided normal map and directional light parameters. It allows for dynamic relighting effects by changing the direction and brightness of the light source, simulating different lighting conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RelightSimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RelightSimple node are: image (the input image to be relit), normals (the corresponding normal map), x_dir (the x-direction component of the light source), y_dir (the y-direction component of the light source), and brightness (the intensity of the light source)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the x_dir parameter control in the RelightSimple node?",
        "answer": "In the RelightSimple node, the x_dir parameter controls the x-direction component of the light source, affecting the apparent direction from which the light is coming."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output image of the RelightSimple node generated?",
        "answer": "The output image of the RelightSimple node is generated by adjusting the input image based on the provided normal map and light direction parameters. The node calculates the interaction between the light and the surface using the normal map and applies the resulting lighting effect to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the RelightSimple node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the RelightSimple node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RelightSimple node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RelightSimple node is an IMAGE, which represents the adjusted output image based on the provided normal map and light direction parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the RelightSimple node require an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the RelightSimple node does not require an output node, as indicated by the 'Output node: False' statement in the documentation."
