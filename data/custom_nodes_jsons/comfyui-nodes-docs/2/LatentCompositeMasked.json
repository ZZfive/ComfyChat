        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentCompositeMasked node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentCompositeMasked node in ComfyUI is designed to blend a source latent sample into specified locations of a destination latent sample, while intelligently managing the compositing operation by considering optional masking and resizing parameters for seamless integration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'destination' parameter represent in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'destination' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node represents the latent sample into which the source sample will be composited. It is crucial for the operation of the node as it defines the base for blending the source sample."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'source' parameter play in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'source' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node is the latent sample to be placed onto the destination. It plays a key role in the functionality of the node as it provides the content to be composited."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'x' parameter influence the compositing operation in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node specifies the horizontal position where the source sample will be placed in the destination. It is important as it determines the exact placement of the compositing operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'y' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'y' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node defines the vertical position where the source sample will be placed in the destination. It is a significant factor in the execution of the node as it dictates the vertical placement of the composited content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does setting the 'resize_source' parameter to True have in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "Setting the 'resize_source' parameter to True in the LatentCompositeMasked node resizes the source to match the dimensions of the destination before the compositing operation. It enhances the node's flexibility in handling different latent sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the LatentCompositeMasked node is an optional tensor that defines the mask for the source sample. It controls which parts of the source are visible after the compositing operation, adding a layer of control over the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'composited_latent' output represent in the LatentCompositeMasked node?",
        "answer": "The 'composited_latent' output in the LatentCompositeMasked node represents the final latent sample after the compositing operation. It encapsulates the result of blending the source into the destination at the specified location using optional masking and resizing."
