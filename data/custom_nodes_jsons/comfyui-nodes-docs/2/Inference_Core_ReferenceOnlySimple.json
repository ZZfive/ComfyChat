        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node serves as a reference implementation in the ComfyUI inference core framework. It provides a simplified example to demonstrate the construction and implementation of inference nodes, focusing on core concepts and practices without the complexity of a full-featured node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node are: model (Comfy dtype: MODEL, Python dtype: torch.nn.Module), reference (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]), and batch_size (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input represent in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node specifies the model used for inference, serving as the main input for the node's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'reference' input in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'reference' input in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node provides a reference or context for the inference process, assisting in the generation or transformation of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' input determine in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' input in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node determines the number of items to be processed in a single batch, affecting the throughput and performance of the inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node are: model (Comfy dtype: MODEL, Python dtype: torch.nn.Module) and latent (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent' output represent in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node contains the latent representation derived from the inference process, providing insights or modifications based on the model's output."
