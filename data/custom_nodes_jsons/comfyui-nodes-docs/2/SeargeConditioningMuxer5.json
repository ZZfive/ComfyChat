        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node acts as a conditional multiplexer, selecting a specific conditioning input based on the value of the selector. It helps route data through the network, ensuring that the appropriate conditioning signal is passed to subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many conditioning inputs does the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node have?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node has five conditioning inputs: input0, input1, input2, input3, and input4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the input_selector in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "The input_selector parameter determines which conditioning input is passed through the node. It is crucial for determining the output based on the set value range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node is CONDITIONING, representing the conditioning input selected by the input_selector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node classified?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node is classified in the Searge/_deprecated_/FlowControl category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the input_selector value is 0 in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "When the input_selector value is 0, the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node returns the input0 conditioning input as the output."
