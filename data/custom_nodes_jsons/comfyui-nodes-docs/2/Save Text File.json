        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Save node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Save node in ComfyUI is designed to manage the process of saving text data to a file. It handles directory creation, checks for empty text, and generates filenames with appropriate padding and delimiters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Text_Save node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Text_Save node are 'text' (the content to be saved to the file) and 'path' (the directory where the text file will be saved)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'filename_prefix' parameter in the WAS_Text_Save node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter in the WAS_Text_Save node sets the starting characters for the filename, helping with the uniqueness and organization of the saved files."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'filename_number_padding' parameter affect the filenames generated by WAS_Text_Save node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_number_padding' parameter in the WAS_Text_Save node determines the number of digits used for the numeric part of the filename, ensuring consistent formatting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the WAS_Text_Save node provide?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Save node provides two outputs: 'text' (returning the text that was saved to the file) and 'ui' (used for providing user interface feedback, typically containing a string representation of the saved text)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Text_Save node handle the situation when the specified path does not exist?",
        "answer": "If the specified path does not exist, the WAS_Text_Save node will create the path using 'os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)'. If the path cannot be created due to lack of write access, an error message is printed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'generate_filename' method in the WAS_Text_Save node?",
        "answer": "The 'generate_filename' method in the WAS_Text_Save node creates a unique filename based on the provided path, prefix, delimiter, number padding, and extension. It checks for existing files with the same pattern and increments the counter until a unique filename is found."
