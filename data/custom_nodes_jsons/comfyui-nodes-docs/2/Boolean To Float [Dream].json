        "question": "What is the purpose of the Boolean To Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float node in ComfyUI converts a boolean input to a floating-point output, allowing custom float values to be assigned for true and false boolean states."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Boolean To Float node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Boolean To Float node are: boolean (BOOLEAN), on_true (FLOAT), and on_false (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Boolean To Float node determine its output value?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float node determines its output value based on the boolean input. If the input is true, it returns the 'on_true' value; if the input is false, it returns the 'on_false' value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Boolean To Float node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Boolean To Float node is FLOAT, representing the floating-point value corresponding to the input boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the Boolean To Float node use?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Boolean To Float node located in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float node is located in the 'âœ¨ Dream/ðŸ›  utils/â­† switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'on_true' input in the Boolean To Float node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'on_true' input in the Boolean To Float node is 1.0."
