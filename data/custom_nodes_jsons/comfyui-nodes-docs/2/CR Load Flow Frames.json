        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_LoadFlowFrames node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_LoadFlowFrames node is designed to load and process image sequences for animation purposes. It can sort and select frames in a directory based on user-defined criteria to ensure a smooth workflow for frame-by-frame operations in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'input_folder' parameter in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_folder' parameter specifies the directory containing the image sequence. It plays a key role in determining the source of the animation images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sort_by' parameter in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node help in maintaining the correct order of frames in an animation sequence?",
        "answer": "The 'sort_by' parameter determines the method of sorting the image files in the input folder. It is crucial for maintaining the correct order of frames in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'current_frame' parameter in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter indicates the starting frame for the image loading process. It is essential for controlling the point at which the node begins operating in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'skip_start_frames' parameter in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node help in excluding unnecessary initial frames from an animation?",
        "answer": "The 'skip_start_frames' parameter allows the user to skip a certain number of frames at the beginning of the sequence. This is useful for excluding initial frames that are not needed for the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_image' output provide in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_image' output provides the latest frame loaded from the image sequence. It is crucial for ongoing animation operations and display."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'previous_image' output in the CR_LoadFlowFrames node be used in animations?",
        "answer": "The 'previous_image' output provides the frame prior to the current one in the sequence. It can be used for comparisons or transition effects in animations."
