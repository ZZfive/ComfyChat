        "question": "What is the purpose of the StyleAlignedBatchAlign class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StyleAlignedBatchAlign class in ComfyUI is designed to modify a given model by aligning its style features across batches, enhancing the model's ability to handle and generate style-aligned outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node are 'model', 'share_norm', and 'share_attn'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'share_norm' parameter determine in the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'share_norm' parameter determines how the normalization layers within the model should be shared or modified, which is crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of style feature alignment within the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'share_attn' parameter in the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'share_attn' parameter specifies which attention mechanisms should be shared or modified to achieve style alignment, playing an important role in the model's overall style handling capability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'scale' parameter in the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter adjusts the degree of style alignment applied to attention and normalization layers, subtly influencing the model's ability to generate style-consistent outputs across batches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node is a modified version of the input model, optimized for style-aligned processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the StyleAlignedBatchAlign node is CPU."
