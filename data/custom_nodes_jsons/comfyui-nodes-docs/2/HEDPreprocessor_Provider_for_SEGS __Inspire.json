        "question": "What is the purpose of HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node provides a preprocessor using the HED (Holistic Edge Detection) algorithm for SEGS (Semantic Edge Guided Synthesis) applications. It is designed to preprocess images by comprehensively detecting edges, thus enhancing the input for SEGS applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'safe' parameter do in the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' parameter determines whether the preprocessing should be performed in safe mode. Safe mode may affect the results of edge detection and may take a more conservative approach to avoid potential errors or anomalies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessed object specifically tailored for SEGS applications, optimized for edge detection enhancement. This preprocessor can be directly used for subsequent SEGS-related tasks, providing high-quality edge information input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what category does the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node falls under the InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is SEGS_PREPROCESSOR."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the source code of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the source code of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'doit'."
