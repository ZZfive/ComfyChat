    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SDXL Prompt Handling Plus node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SDXL Prompt Handling Plus node are 'pos_g' and 'pos_l'. 'pos_g' is the processed global positive prompt optimized for clarity and effectiveness, and 'pos_l' is the optimized local positive prompt specialized for adding specific context or emphasis to the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the SDXL Prompt Handling Plus node use?",
