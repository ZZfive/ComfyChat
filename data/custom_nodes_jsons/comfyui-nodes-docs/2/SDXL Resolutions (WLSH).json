        "question": "What is the purpose of the get_resolutions method in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The get_resolutions method in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node is designed to process image resolution and orientation data. It takes a string representing the resolution and an orientation indicator as inputs, converts the resolution into integer values for width and height, and adjusts these values according to the provided orientation to ensure the correct aspect ratio is maintained for portrait or landscape orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the get_resolutions method?",
        "answer": "The get_resolutions method requires two input parameters: 'resolution', which is a string specifying the dimensions of the image in 'widthxheight' format, and 'direction', which indicates the orientation of the image and can be either 'landscape' or 'portrait'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resolution' parameter represent in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node is a string that specifies the dimensions of the image in 'widthxheight' format. It is crucial for determining the pixel dimensions of the image and is used to calculate the width and height values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'direction' parameter indicate in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node indicates the orientation of the image and can be either 'landscape' or 'portrait'. This parameter is essential for adjusting the width and height values to match the specified orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the get_resolutions method in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The get_resolutions method in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node outputs two integer values: 'width' and 'height'. 'width' represents the image width considering the orientation specified by the 'direction' input, and 'height' corresponds to the adjusted image height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' output represent in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' output in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node represents the image width after considering the orientation specified by the 'direction' input. It is an integer value reflecting the number of pixels on the horizontal axis of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'height' output represent in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node?",
        "answer": "The 'height' output in the WLSH_SDXL_Resolutions node corresponds to the image height after adjusting for the orientation. It is an integer value indicating the number of pixels on the vertical axis of the image."
