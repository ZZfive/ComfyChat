        "question": "What is the purpose of the Dissolve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Dissolve node in ComfyUI is designed to seamlessly blend two images based on a specified dissolve factor, creating a smooth transition between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Dissolve node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Dissolve node are: image1 (the first input image), image2 (the second input image), and dissolve_factor (a float value determining the blending ratio between the two images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the dissolve_factor control in the Dissolve node?",
        "answer": "The dissolve_factor in the Dissolve node determines the blending ratio between image1 and image2. A value of 0.0 shows only image1, while a value of 1.0 shows only image2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Dissolve node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Dissolve node is a single image representing the result of blending image1 and image2 using the specified dissolve factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the Dissolve node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the Dissolve node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Dissolve node create a smooth transition between two images?",
        "answer": "The Dissolve node creates a smooth transition between two images by generating a dither pattern and using it to determine the contribution of each image to the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the dissolve_images function in the Dissolve node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the dissolve_images function in the Dissolve node is a tuple containing a single torch.Tensor representing the dissolved image."
