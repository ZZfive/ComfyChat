        "question": "What is the purpose of the FilmGrain node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FilmGrain node in ComfyUI introduces random noise patterns to an image, simulating the texture of film grain. It enhances the visual aesthetic by adding depth and texture, and is commonly used for artistic and stylized post-processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the FilmGrain node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the FilmGrain node are: image, intensity, scale, temperature, and vignette."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the intensity parameter affect the FilmGrain effect?",
        "answer": "The intensity parameter controls the magnitude of the noise applied to the image. Higher values result in more pronounced grain patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the scale parameter adjust in the FilmGrain node?",
        "answer": "The scale parameter adjusts the size of the noise pattern relative to the image. Larger scales lead to more pronounced noise characteristics, adding a more dramatic effect to the film grain appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the temperature parameter influence the output image in FilmGrain?",
        "answer": "The temperature parameter adjusts the color balance of the image, adding a warmer or cooler feel. It can subtly change the mood and overall feel of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the vignette parameter in the FilmGrain node?",
        "answer": "The vignette parameter controls the intensity of fading at the edges of the image, creating a more focused and dramatic visual effect. It can guide the viewer's attention towards the center of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FilmGrain node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FilmGrain node is the modified image with the film grain effect applied, including the adjusted intensity, scale, temperature, and vignette parameters. It represents the final creative output of the node."
