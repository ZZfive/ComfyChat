        "question": "What is the purpose of the QRCodeGenerator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The QRCodeGenerator node in ComfyUI is used to generate QR codes based on specified text input, with various customization options such as size, version, error correction level, box size, and border size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'text' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node is the input string that needs to be encoded into a QR code. It is a crucial parameter as it determines the content represented by the QR code."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' parameter affect the generated QR code in the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node specifies the final dimensions of the generated QR code image in pixels. It affects the visibility and scannability of the QR code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'qr_version' parameter control in the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'qr_version' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node determines the version of the QR code, indirectly controlling its size and the amount of data that can be encoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'error_correction' parameter influence the QR code generated by the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'error_correction' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node sets the error correction level of the QR code, affecting its resistance to damage and the amount of data that can be recovered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'box_size' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'box_size' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node defines the size of each box (or pixel) in the QR code, affecting the overall dimensions of the QR code."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'border' parameter affect the QR code generated by the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The 'border' parameter in the QRCodeGenerator node specifies the width of the border around the QR code. A larger border can improve scannability but will increase the overall size of the QR code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the QRCodeGenerator node?",
        "answer": "The output of the QRCodeGenerator node is the generated QR code image, which can be directly used for various applications."
