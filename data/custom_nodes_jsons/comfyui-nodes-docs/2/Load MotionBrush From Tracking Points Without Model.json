        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node in ComfyUI abstracts the process of generating motion data from tracking points without the need for a pre-stored model, making it convenient for users to create motion brushes based on the provided tracking points."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the model_length parameter determine in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The model_length parameter in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node determines the duration of the motion sequence, which is crucial for the node's operation as it decides the number of frames in the output motion brush."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the width parameter affect the output of the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The width parameter in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node specifies the horizontal resolution of the motion brush, which is essential for establishing the spatial context of the motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the height parameter play in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The height parameter in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node defines the vertical resolution of the motion brush and plays a key role in determining the spatial dimensions of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the tracking_points parameter required in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The tracking_points parameter is required in the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node because it provides the raw tracking data used to construct the motion brush, directly affecting the quality and accuracy of the motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node is a MotionBrush, which is a tensor representing the motion data over the specified duration and spatial dimensions, containing the main functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the LoadMotionBrushFromTrackingPointsWithoutModel node is CPU."
