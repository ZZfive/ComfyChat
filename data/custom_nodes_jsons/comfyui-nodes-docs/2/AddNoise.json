        "question": "What is the purpose of the AddNoise node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to introduce random noise into latent images, which is a crucial step in generating synthetic images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AddNoise node integrate noise into latent images?",
        "answer": "The AddNoise node integrates noise into latent images by scaling the noise according to specified sigmas and then combining it with the latent image to produce a noisy output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model' parameter in the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is essential for the AddNoise node as it determines the model used for sampling and processing latent images, directly affecting the quality and characteristics of the generated noisy images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'noise' parameter important for the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' parameter is crucial for the AddNoise node because it provides the source of randomness that will be integrated into the latent image, significantly influencing the diversity and unpredictability of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigmas' parameter control in the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigmas' parameter in the AddNoise node controls the scale of the noise to be added to the latent image, playing a key role in regulating the noise level and the visual appearance of the synthesized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' parameter represent in the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter in the AddNoise node represents the image data that will be modified through the addition of noise, and its structure and content are crucial to the functionality of the node and the final outcome of the image synthesis process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output of the AddNoise node is a 'latent' parameter, which represents the noisy image obtained after applying the AddNoise node. It encapsulates the synthesized data carrying the desired noise characteristics for further processing or analysis."
