            "question": "What are the use cases for the `signal_source` custom node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The `signal_source` custom node in ComfyUI is used in practice when one wants a value to be repeated several times in a row or when a pattern needs to be instructed to a controllable device."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the `square_bridge` custom node in ComfyUI work?",
            "answer": "The `square_bridge` custom node in ComfyUI receives a signal and outputs 2 identical phases with a 180-degree difference. Each phase increases exponentially."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the purpose of the `signal_processing` custom node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The `signal_processing` custom node in ComfyUI is used to modify the signal amplitude, change the signal phase, and create new signals from the received signals. It's a powerful tool for manipulating signals in a pipeline."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the input (squared) for the `temporal Delhi waves` and 'asymmetry` while using the constant custom node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The `temporal Delhi waves` and 'asymmetry` are used in the multiplicative_NUMBER custom node in ComfyUI when squared."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the indices custom node help data visualizations?",
            "answer": "The indices custom node in ComfyUI helps to differentiate datasets that are positioned sequentially in time, allowing clear separation of sequential and non-sequential datasets."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the `accessories` custom node in ComfyUI work?",
            "answer": "The `accessories` custom node in ComfyUI is used to configure the controller, allowing you to add a variety of accessories to your ComfyUI setup like a USB concentrator, a router, or simply a touchpad."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the `missing nodes log` custom node in ComfyUI help control system debugging?",
            "answer": "The `missing nodes log` custom node in ComfyUI collects missing `nodes` in time and logs them in aWARNING section, which helps with debugging control systems."
