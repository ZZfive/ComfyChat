        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleReverb node in ComfyUI adds a reverb effect to audio input, simulating the sound reflection characteristics of a physical space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node are 'audio' (the audio input to which the reverb effect will be applied), 'reverb_level' (which determines the intensity of the reverb effect), and 'decay' (which controls the decay rate of the reverb effect)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'reverb_level' input determine in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node?",
        "answer": "The 'reverb_level' input in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node determines the intensity of the reverb effect applied to the audio, affecting the perceived size and reflectivity of the virtual space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'decay' input control in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node?",
        "answer": "The 'decay' input in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node controls the decay rate of the reverb effect, simulating the absorption characteristics of the simulated space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node is 'audio', which is the audio output with the applied reverb effect, simulating the acoustic characteristics of a space with reverb."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleReverb node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node apply the reverb effect to the audio input in its source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node, the reverb effect is applied to the audio input by overlaying delayed and decayed versions of the original audio onto itself in a loop, with the delay and decay determined by the 'reverb_level' and 'decay' inputs."
