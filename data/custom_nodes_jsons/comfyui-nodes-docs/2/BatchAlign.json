        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchAlign node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAlign node in ComfyUI is designed to align multiple sets of data batches to ensure consistency and uniformity between different input sets."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the BatchAlign node are images, ref_frame, direction, and blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'direction' input specify in the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' input in the BatchAlign node specifies the direction of alignment, which may affect how images are adjusted relative to the reference frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blur' input determine in the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' input in the BatchAlign node determines the level of blurring applied during the alignment process, affecting the smoothness or sharpness of the aligned images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the BatchAlign node are 'aligned' images and 'flow' field or mapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'aligned' output represent in the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'aligned' output in the BatchAlign node represents the result of aligning input images, generating a set of coherent images aligned with the reference frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'flow' output indicate in the BatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'flow' output in the BatchAlign node indicates the flow field or mapping applied to each image for alignment, helping to understand the alignment process."
