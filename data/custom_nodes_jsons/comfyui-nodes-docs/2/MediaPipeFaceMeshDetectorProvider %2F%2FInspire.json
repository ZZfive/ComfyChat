        "question": "What is the purpose of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI is designed to detect and segment faces in images using the MediaPipe FaceMesh model. It provides the capability to identify and isolate facial features such as face contours, eyes, eyebrows, and mouth, with the primary goal of enhancing facial details in images, which is particularly useful for applications involving facial recognition, animation, or enhancing low-resolution facial images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_faces' parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node define?",
        "answer": "The 'max_faces' parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node defines the maximum number of faces the detector should identify in the input image. It plays a key role in controlling the scope of the detection process and is directly related to the performance and accuracy of face detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'face' parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node affect the detection process?",
        "answer": "The 'face' parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node indicates whether the detector should include the entire facial region during the detection process. Enabling this option ensures the capture of the facial area, which is essential for tasks requiring comprehensive facial details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mouth' parameter in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetector node?",
        "answer": "When the 'mouth' parameter is enabled, it indicates to the detector to specifically recognize the mouth area in the detected faces. This is important for applications that need to focus on mouth movements or expressions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bbox_detector' output provide in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox_detector' output in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node provides the bounding box coordinates of the detected faces, which is crucial for locating and further processing facial regions within images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segm_detector' output provide in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'segm_detector' output in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node provides segmentation masks for the detected faces, allowing for high-precision isolation and manipulation of facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node run on?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node runs on the CPU infrastructure type."
