        "question": "What is the purpose of the Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Int node in ComfyUI is designed to handle integer values, allowing these values to be manipulated or evaluated in a logical or computational context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the Int node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Int node is 'value', which defines the integer value to be processed or manipulated by the node. It serves as the main input for the node's operations or evaluations."
