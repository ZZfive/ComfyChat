        "question": "What is the purpose of the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node is used to blend two batches of image sequences together with a crossfade effect over a specified number of frames, creating a smooth transition between the sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node are: batch1 (first batch of images), batch2 (second batch of images), fade_frames (number of frames for the crossfade effect), fade_strength (intensity of the fade effect), and ease_type (type of easing function for the transition)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fade_frames parameter control in the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The fade_frames parameter specifies the number of frames over which the crossfade effect should last, determining the duration of the transition effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the fade_strength parameter affect the output of the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The fade_strength parameter controls the intensity of the fade effect, determining the degree to which the two batches of images are blended together."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the ease_type parameter in the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the ease_type parameter are: linear, ease_in, ease_out, or ease_in_out. These options determine the type of easing function used for the transition, affecting its smoothness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node is a batch of images with the crossfade effect applied, including the unfaded, faded, and remaining frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the number of fade frames is greater than the number of frames in either batch1 or batch2?",
        "answer": "If the number of fade frames is greater than the number of frames in either batch1 or batch2, a ValueError will be raised, as the number of fade frames must be less than or equal to the number of frames in each batch."
