        "question": "What is the purpose of the Resolution Multiply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply node in ComfyUI is used to scale the dimensions of an image by a specified factor, effectively multiplying the image's width and height by this factor to generate new dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Resolution Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Resolution Multiply node are 'width', 'height', and 'factor'. 'width' and 'height' specify the original dimensions of the image, while 'factor' is the multiplier used to scale these dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input do in the Resolution Multiply node?",
        "answer": "In the Resolution Multiply node, the 'factor' input is used to scale the image's width and height. A factor greater than 1 will increase the image size, while a factor less than 1 would decrease it, although the node's constraints do not allow for shrinking."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Resolution Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Resolution Multiply node are 'width_resized' and 'height_resized', which represent the new width and height of the image after scaling by the specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type of the Resolution Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type of the Resolution Multiply node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the Resolution Multiply node do?",
        "answer": "The source code of the Resolution Multiply node defines the nodeâ€™s input and output types, and includes a function 'get_newres' that takes the width, height, and factor as inputs, and returns the new width and height after scaling by the factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Resolution Multiply node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply node belongs to the category 'JPS Nodes/Math' in ComfyUI."
