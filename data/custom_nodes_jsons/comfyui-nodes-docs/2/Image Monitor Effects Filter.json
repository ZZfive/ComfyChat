        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node is designed to apply various distortion effects to images, simulating different types of monitor or signal distortions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available modes for the distortion effect in the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The available modes for the distortion effect in the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node are 'Digital Distortion', 'Signal Distortion', and 'TV Distortion'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'amplitude' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter controls the intensity of the distortion effect. Higher values result in more pronounced distortions, while lower values produce subtler effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'offset' parameter affect the distortion effect in the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'offset' parameter adjusts the position of the distortion effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the distortion's appearance. It shifts the distortion pattern, altering the visual dynamics of the final result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node is an IMAGE, which is a processed image with the applied distortion effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How versatile is the WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node in terms of its applications?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Monitor_Distortion_Filter node is highly versatile and suitable for a wide range of applications, from visual effects to artistic image transformations."
