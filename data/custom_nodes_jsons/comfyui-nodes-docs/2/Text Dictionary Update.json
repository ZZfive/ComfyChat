        "question": "What is the role of the 'dictionary_b' parameter in the 'dictionary_update' method?",
        "answer": "The 'dictionary_b' parameter is the second dictionary to be merged. It contributes to the comprehensiveness of the resulting dictionary by adding its key-value pairs to the aggregation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'dictionary_c' parameter in the 'dictionary_update' method?",
        "answer": "The 'dictionary_c' parameter is an optional dictionary that can be included in the merge process. If provided, its contents are also integrated into the final dictionary, enhancing the aggregation with additional data."

    {
        "question": "What is the 'dictionary_d' parameter in the 'dictionary_update' method?",
        "answer": "The 'dictionary_d' parameter is another optional dictionary that can be used to further enrich the merged dictionary. Its inclusion depends on the specific needs of the application and the desired level of data aggregation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'dictionary_update' method?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'dictionary_update' method is 'return_dictionary', which represents the merged result of all input dictionaries. It is a key component in applications that require a unified view of combined data sources."
