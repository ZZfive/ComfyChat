        "question": "What is the main purpose of the ImageCompositeRelative node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageCompositeRelative node in ComfyUI is used to composite two sets of images based on their relative sizes and positions, allowing for dynamic image overlaying and operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two required input parameters that represent the sets of images to be composited in the ImageCompositeRelative node?",
        "answer": "The two required input parameters that represent the sets of images to be composited in the ImageCompositeRelative node are images_a and images_b."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the images_a_x parameter affect the composite image in the ImageCompositeRelative node?",
        "answer": "The images_a_x parameter in the ImageCompositeRelative node specifies the horizontal position of the first set of images relative to the container width, affecting their placement in the composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the background parameter in the ImageCompositeRelative node specify?",
        "answer": "The background parameter in the ImageCompositeRelative node specifies which set of images (images_a or images_b) should be considered the background layer in the composite image, affecting the visual hierarchy and stacking."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which container size strategy is used when the container_size_type parameter is set to 'max' in the ImageCompositeRelative node?",
        "answer": "When the container_size_type parameter is set to 'max' in the ImageCompositeRelative node, the container size strategy used is to set the container width and height to the maximum width and height of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageCompositeRelative node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageCompositeRelative node is IMAGE, which represents the resulting composite image created by blending and overlaying the specified images according to given positions, sizes, and methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which method is used to determine the offset of an image within the container in the ImageCompositeRelative node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageCompositeRelative node, the method used to determine the offset of an image within the container is offset_by_percent, which calculates the offset based on the container size, image size, and the specified percentage."
