        "question": "What is the purpose of the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node is designed to configure settings for the MiDaS depth estimation model in control networks, allowing users to specify the source of depth information, strength, and the range of depth effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node include: midas_from, midas_strength, midas_start, midas_end, midas_a, and midas_bg."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'midas_from' input type specify?",
        "answer": "The 'midas_from' input type specifies the source of depth information, providing options such as 'Source Image', 'Support Image', or 'Support Direct'. This selection determines the source of the depth data used for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the strength of the depth effect controlled in the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node?",
        "answer": "The strength of the depth effect is controlled by the 'midas_strength' input, which allows for fine-tuning of depth perception."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the 'midas_start' and 'midas_end' inputs define?",
        "answer": "The 'midas_start' input defines the starting point of the depth effect application, allowing precise control over where the depth begins to take effect. The 'midas_end' input sets the endpoint of the depth effect, allowing users to limit the influence of depth within a specific range of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'midas_a' and 'midas_bg' inputs?",
        "answer": "The 'midas_a' input adjusts a specific parameter within the MiDaS model, providing additional customization options for the depth effect. The 'midas_bg' input modifies the background depth value, allowing users to fine-tune the background strength of the depth effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CtrlNet MiDaS Settings node is 'midas_settings', which presents the configuration settings for the MiDaS model in a tuple format that can be directly used in the depth estimation process."
