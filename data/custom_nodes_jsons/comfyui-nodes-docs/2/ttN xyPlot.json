        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN xyPlot node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN xyPlot node is used to generate and handle XY plots in a specific visualization framework. It validates chart types, manages chart variables, and coordinates image generation based on XY coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'grid_spacing' input determine in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'grid_spacing' input decides the spacing between grid points in the chart, affecting the chart's resolution and visual density."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'latent_id' input affect the visualization in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_id' input identifies a specific latent variable to be used in the chart, influencing the representation and visualization of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'output_individuals' input in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_individuals' input controls whether individual data points are output, affecting the level of detail of the chart visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'flip_xy' input change the chart's direction in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'flip_xy' input specifies whether the X and Y axes should be flipped, changing the orientation of the chart."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x_axis' input define in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_axis' input defines the data type or category of the X-axis, shaping how the data is interpreted and plotted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'x_values' and 'y_values' inputs in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_values' and 'y_values' inputs are lists of values to be plotted on the X and Y axes respectively, determining the position and arrangement of points in the chart."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'INFO' output represent in the ttN xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'INFO' output represents the generated XY plot data, encapsulating the visual representation of the plotted points."
