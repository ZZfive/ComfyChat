        "question": "What is the purpose of the PreviewBridge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PreviewBridge node in ComfyUI is designed to handle and manage image data, providing a bridge between input images and subsequent processing stages. It is responsible for loading, converting, and caching images to optimize workflows and ensure efficient processing of visual data within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the PreviewBridge node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the PreviewBridge node are 'images' and 'unique_id'. 'images' represents the input image data that needs to be processed, and 'unique_id' uniquely identifies each image or dataset handled by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'image' parameter in the PreviewBridge node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is an optional identifier for a specific image in the node's operations. It can be used to reference or retrieve specific image data based on the provided identifier, playing an important role in customizing node behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the PreviewBridge node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the PreviewBridge node are 'ui' and 'result'. 'ui' contains user interface elements related to the node's operations, while 'result' encapsulates the processed image data and corresponding masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the PreviewBridge node use?",
        "answer": "The PreviewBridge node uses the CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PreviewBridge node handle image loading and caching?",
        "answer": "The PreviewBridge node loads and caches images using a unique identifier. It checks if the image is already cached and loads it from the cache if available. If the image is not cached or needs to be refreshed, the node saves the image, updates the cache, and returns the processed image data and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'unique_id' parameter in the PreviewBridge node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is crucial for the functionality of the PreviewBridge node as it uniquely identifies each image or dataset processed by the node. It ensures that the node can accurately track and manage images, which is vital for the node's operation and the integrity of the results."
