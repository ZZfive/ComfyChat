        "question": "What is the purpose of the Laboratory [Dream] node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Laboratory [Dream] node is designed to generate and manipulate values based on various modes such as uniform random, bell-shaped random, ladder, and random walk. It allows for dynamically generating values within a specified range, making it a versatile tool for experimentation and simulation in creative projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'key' input in the Laboratory [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' input serves as a unique identifier for the generated value. It supports default randomization to ensure uniqueness and plays a crucial role in tracking and retrieving values across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'renew_policy' input affect the generation of values in the Laboratory [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'renew_policy' input defines the strategy for updating the generated values. It influences the frequency of producing new values based on frame changes or initial generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'min_value' and 'max_value' inputs in the Laboratory [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_value' and 'max_value' inputs set the lower and upper limits for the generated values. They are crucial in defining the range of values and ensuring the output stays within expected boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' input determine the method of value generation in the Laboratory [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input specifies the method for generating values, which affects the distribution and variation of the output values. The available modes include uniform random, bell-shaped random, ladder, and random walk."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'step_size' input in the Laboratory [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'step_size' input determines the increment size between values in certain modes. It influences the granularity and smoothness of value transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the Laboratory [Dream] node provide?",
        "answer": "The Laboratory [Dream] node provides three output types: FLOAT (the primary generated floating-point value), INT (the integer representation of the primary generated value), and log_entry (a detailed log entry recording the generation or reuse of values for debugging and analysis)."
