        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to conditionally select one of two latent representations based on a boolean flag. It serves as a logic switch to direct the flow of latent data in a neural network pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node are 'latent_a' and 'latent_b', which represent the latent representations to be conditionally selected based on the boolean flag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boolean' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' parameter acts as the control signal for the decision process of the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node. It directly influences which latent representation is selected, thereby affecting the overall behavior of the neural network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node is 'latent_output', which represents the selected latent representation based on the provided boolean flag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Latent_Input_Switch node is classified under the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the 'latent_input_switch' function in the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the 'latent_input_switch' function in the WAS_Latent_Input_Switch class is a tuple containing the selected latent representation based on the boolean flag."
