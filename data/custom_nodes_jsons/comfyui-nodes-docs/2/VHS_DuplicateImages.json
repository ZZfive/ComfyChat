        "question": "What is the purpose of the DuplicateImages node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DuplicateImages node in ComfyUI is designed to copy a given set of images a specified number of times. It is used to increase image data, which is suitable for scenarios such as machine learning, where larger datasets can improve model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DuplicateImages node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DuplicateImages node are 'images', which is a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'multiply_by' parameter in the DuplicateImages node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'multiply_by' parameter in the DuplicateImages node determines how many times each image in the 'images' input will be duplicated. It is an integer that directly impacts the size of the output dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the DuplicateImages node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the DuplicateImages node are 'IMAGE', which is a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor, and 'count', which is a Comfy dtype of INT and a Python dtype of int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output parameter in the DuplicateImages node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output parameter in the DuplicateImages node provides the total number of images after duplication. This integer value helps track the size of the dataset, which may be important for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the DuplicateImages node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the DuplicateImages node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the source code of the DuplicateImages node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the DuplicateImages node defines the class DuplicateImages with methods for specifying input types, category, return types, return names, and the function for duplicating input images based on the 'multiply_by' parameter."
