        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactQueueTrigger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactQueueTrigger node is designed to manage the triggering of operations within a system. When called with a signal and mode, it decides whether to activate specific processes by sending commands to an instance of PromptServer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'signal' parameter in the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' parameter is crucial for the operation of the ImpactQueueTrigger node as it represents the input that determines the conditions for triggering processes. It is essential for the correct functioning of the node and directly influences the decision-making process regarding the initiation of subsequent actions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'mode' parameter in the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter is an optional toggler that specifies whether the node should trigger the associated operation. It has a default value set to True, meaning that by default, the operation will be triggered. This parameter allows controlling the behavior of the node without altering the main input signal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'signal_opt' output represent in the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal_opt' output represents the optimized or processed signal after the execution of the ImpactQueueTrigger node. It encapsulates the result of the triggering decision and forwards the signal for further use or analysis within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the ImpactQueueTrigger node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node setting for the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The output node setting for the ImpactQueueTrigger node is True, indicating that it is an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'mode' parameter in the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'mode' parameter in the ImpactQueueTrigger node is True, meaning that by default, the associated operation will be triggered."
