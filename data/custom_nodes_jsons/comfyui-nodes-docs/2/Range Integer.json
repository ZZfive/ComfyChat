        "question": "What is the purpose of the RangeInteger node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RangeInteger node is designed to generate a sequence of integers within a specified range. It allows customization of the sequence's starting point, end point, and step size, and also offers a seed option for sequence reproducibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' parameter define in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter defines the beginning of the integer sequence. It is crucial as it sets the initial value for the sequence generation and directly impacts the range and the first element of the sequence produced by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end' parameter specify in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'end' parameter specifies the exclusive upper limit of the integer sequence. It is important as it determines the end point of the sequence, i.e., the value after the last element. This parameter is essential for defining the range of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'step' parameter in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter indicates the increment between each integer in the sequence. It is important as it controls the spacing of numbers within the sequence, allowing customization of the progression rate. The default value is 0, which means a step of 1 if not specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'seed' parameter in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to introduce a degree of randomness control in the sequence generation process. It is important for ensuring the reproducibility of the sequence, which is crucial in experiments or simulations where consistent results are required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'integer' output provide in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'integer' output provides one integer from the generated sequence, determined by the input parameters and seed value. It is important as it represents the main result of the node's operation, serving as the basis for further computations or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'string' output return in the RangeInteger node?",
        "answer": "The 'string' output returns the string representation of the selected integer from the sequence. This output is useful when a text representation of the integer is needed, such as for logging or display purposes."
