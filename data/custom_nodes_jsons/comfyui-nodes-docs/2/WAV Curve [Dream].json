        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAV Curve node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAV Curve node in ComfyUI dynamically generates animation curves based on audio data from a WAV file, allowing animations to synchronize with the audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAV Curve node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAV Curve node are frame_counter, wav_path, and scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the frame_counter input affect the WAV Curve node?",
        "answer": "The frame_counter input is crucial for determining the current position on the animation timeline, influencing which part of the WAV file's amplitude is used to generate the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the scale input do in the WAV Curve node?",
        "answer": "The scale input adjusts the intensity of the animation curve by multiplying the amplitude values extracted from the WAV file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the WAV Curve node provide?",
        "answer": "The WAV Curve node provides two output types: FLOAT and INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FLOAT output type represent the amplitude values from the WAV file?",
        "answer": "The FLOAT output type represents the scaled amplitude values from the WAV file as floating-point numbers, suitable for precise animation adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the INT output type represent the amplitude values from the WAV file?",
        "answer": "The INT output type represents the scaled amplitude values from the WAV file by rounding them to the nearest integer, suitable for discrete animation steps."
