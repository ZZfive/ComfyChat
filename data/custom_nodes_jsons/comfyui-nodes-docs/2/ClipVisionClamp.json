        "question": "What is the purpose of the ClipVisionClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ClipVisionClamp node is designed to process and pass through CLIP_VISION data unchanged, serving as a direct conduit for CLIP_VISION data in a pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ClipVisionClamp node is 'clip_vision', which represents the CLIP_VISION data to be processed by the node. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly handles the input data without making any modifications, ensuring the integrity of the CLIP_VISION data throughout the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the 'clip_vision' input in the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the 'clip_vision' input in the ClipVisionClamp node is 'CLIP_VISION'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'clip_vision' input in the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'clip_vision' input in the ClipVisionClamp node is 'tuple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ClipVisionClamp node is 'clip_vision', which returns the received unmodified CLIP_VISION data, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data for further processing or use in subsequent nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the output 'clip_vision' in the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the output 'clip_vision' in the ClipVisionClamp node is 'CLIP_VISION'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output 'clip_vision' in the ClipVisionClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the output 'clip_vision' in the ClipVisionClamp node is 'tuple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What hardware type does the ClipVisionClamp node use?",
        "answer": "The ClipVisionClamp node uses the 'CPU' hardware type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ClipVisionClamp node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the ClipVisionClamp node is not an output node. It is indicated as 'False' for being an output node."
