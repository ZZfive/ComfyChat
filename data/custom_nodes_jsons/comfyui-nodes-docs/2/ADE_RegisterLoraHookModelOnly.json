        "question": "What is the purpose of the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node in ComfyUI is designed to register a model as a LoRA (low-rank adaptation) hook, focusing on the model without involving any CLIP model. It provides a simplified method to integrate LoRA hooks into models for advanced customization and performance tuning."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node are: model (the model to register the LoRA hook on), lora_name (the name of the LoRA configuration to apply), and strength_model (a float value representing the strength of the LoRA adaptation on the model)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input represent in the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "In the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node, the 'model' input represents the model to which the LoRA hook will be registered. It is the main target of the LoRA adaptation and determines the scope and impact of the applied modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_name' input specify in the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "In the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node, the 'lora_name' input specifies the name of the LoRA configuration to be applied. It determines the specific LoRA adaptation settings and parameters to be used, guiding the customization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength_model' input affect the LoRA adaptation in the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "In the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node, the 'strength_model' input is a float value that represents the strength of the LoRA adaptation on the model. This parameter controls the intensity of the applied LoRA modifications, allowing for fine-tuning of the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node are: model (the model with the registered LoRA hook, reflecting the modified state of the model and showcasing the effect of the LoRA adaptation) and lora_hook (the LoRA hook registered to the model, representing the applied LoRA adaptation mechanism for further customization and performance tuning)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type recommended for the Register LoRA Hook (Model Only) node is CPU."
