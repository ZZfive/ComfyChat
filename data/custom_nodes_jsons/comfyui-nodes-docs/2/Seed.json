        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the WAS_Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the WAS_Seed node is to generate and manipulate numerical seeds, which are crucial for initializing random number generators and ensuring reproducibility in random processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is essential for the node's operation as it determines the starting point for generating a series of numbers. It ensures predictability and repeatability in the random number generation process, which is vital in simulations and probability models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is accepted for the 'seed' input in the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input in the WAS_Seed node accepts an integer (INT) data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'number' output represent in the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' output represents the decimal form of the seed, which can be used in calculations requiring non-integer values, expanding the node's applicability in various mathematical contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'float' output derived in the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'float' output is derived by converting the seed value to a floating-point number, which is crucial for operations requiring decimal precision, such as scientific computations and statistical analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'int' output in the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The 'int' output provides the integer form of the seed value, suitable for operations that only accept integer inputs, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of numerical algorithms and applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for running the WAS_Seed node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the WAS_Seed node is CPU."
