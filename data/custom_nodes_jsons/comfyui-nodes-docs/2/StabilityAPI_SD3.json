    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the StabilityAPI_SD3 node include prompt, n_prompt, seed, model, aspect_ratio, and output_format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' parameter in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node control?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node is the seed value for the random number generator, ensuring the reproducibility of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'image' parameter in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node is used for img2img tasks, serving as the initial image for transformation or enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StabilityAPI_SD3 node handle API key management?",
        "answer": "The StabilityAPI_SD3 node allows users to input an API key directly or retrieve it from a config.json file under the node packs folder, ensuring secure and authorized access to the StabilityAI API."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StabilityAPI_SD3 node include the generated or transformed image and a user interface component for displaying the resulting image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StabilityAPI_SD3 node determine the mode for generating images?",
        "answer": "If no image is provided, the StabilityAPI_SD3 node sets the mode to text-to-image. If an image is provided, the mode is set to image-to-image."
