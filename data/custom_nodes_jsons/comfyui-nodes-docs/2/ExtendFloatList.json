        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendFloatList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendFloatList node is designed to concatenate multiple lists of floating-point numbers into a single extended list, which is particularly useful for efficiently aggregating data from different sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ExtendFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter specifies the number of floating-point number lists to be concatenated, influencing the execution process of the node and the size of the resulting list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype does the 'inputs_len' parameter use?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter uses the Comfy dtype 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ExtendFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ExtendFloatList node is a concatenated list of floating-point numbers, represented by the Comfy dtype 'FLOAT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does the output of the ExtendFloatList node correspond to?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype corresponding to the output of the ExtendFloatList node is List[float]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the ExtendFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ExtendFloatList node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the underlying Python code for the ExtendFloatList class?",
        "answer": "The source code for the ExtendFloatList class is: ```python class ExtendFloatList(metaclass=ExtendListMeta): TYPE = \"FLOAT\" ```"
