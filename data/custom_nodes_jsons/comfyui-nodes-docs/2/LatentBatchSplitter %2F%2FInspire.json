        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentBatchSplitter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchSplitter node is designed to split a batch of latent representations into multiple subsets, enhancing the flexibility of latent space exploration for diversified applications in data processing and model training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'latent' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' parameter is crucial as it provides the initial batch of latent representations to be processed by the node. It forms the basis for all subsequent operations, enabling the node to perform its intended function of splitting and reorganizing data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'split_count' parameter influence the output of the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The 'split_count' parameter determines the number of subsets into which the latent batch will be divided. It plays a key role in defining the granularity of the output and can significantly affect the diversity and distribution of the generated dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'latent' represent in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The output 'latent' represents the reorganized batch of latent representations, now structured into the specified number of subsets. This output is crucial for downstream processes that rely on partitioned data, such as model training or the generation of diverse content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the LatentBatchSplitter node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'split_count' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'split_count' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node is 4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum value allowed for the 'split_count' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The maximum value allowed for the 'split_count' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node is 50."
