        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the WAS_Dictionary_New node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Dictionary_New node is designed to efficiently create and manage dictionaries, facilitating the addition of key-value pairs and ensuring that only non-empty keys are added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'key_1' parameter in the WAS_Dictionary_New node?",
        "answer": "The 'key_1' parameter is a string that serves as the first key in the dictionary. It plays a crucial role in defining the dictionary's structure and is essential for the node's operations as it determines the unique identifier associated with a value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'value_1' parameter contribute to the functionality of the WAS_Dictionary_New node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_1' parameter holds the value corresponding to 'key_1' in the dictionary. It is important because it stores the data associated with the key, and its inclusion adds meaningful content to the dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of optional parameters like 'key_2' and 'value_2' in the WAS_Dictionary_New node?",
        "answer": "Optional parameters like 'key_2' and 'value_2' provide flexibility in structuring data within the dictionary and allow for more complex data relationships within the dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS_Dictionary_New node handle the addition of key-value pairs to the dictionary?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Dictionary_New node uses the 'append_to_dictionary' method to add key-value pairs to the dictionary, ensuring that only non-empty keys are added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Dictionary_New node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Dictionary_New node is a dictionary ('DICT' in ComfyUI), which represents the structured data resulting from the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the WAS_Dictionary_New node use?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Dictionary_New node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
