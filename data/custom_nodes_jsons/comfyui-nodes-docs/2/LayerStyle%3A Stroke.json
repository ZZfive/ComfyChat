        "question": "What is the purpose of the StrokeV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StrokeV2 node in ComfyUI is used to generate strokes around a layer image on top of a background image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the StrokeV2 node are: background_image, layer_image, invert_mask, blend_mode, opacity, stroke_grow, stroke_width, blur, and stroke_color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert_mask' parameter do in the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert_mask' parameter in the StrokeV2 node determines whether to invert the mask used for generating the stroke."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the stroke width controlled in the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The stroke width in the StrokeV2 node is controlled by the 'stroke_width' parameter, which is an integer value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'stroke_grow' parameter in the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'stroke_grow' parameter in the StrokeV2 node determines the expansion or contraction amount of the stroke. Positive values expand the stroke, while negative values contract it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StrokeV2 node are 'image' (the resulting image with the stroke applied) and 'mask' (the mask used for generating the stroke)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'layer_mask' parameter required or optional in the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'layer_mask' parameter is optional in the StrokeV2 node. It is used as the mask for the layer image when generating the stroke."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'blend_mode' parameter used for in the StrokeV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_mode' parameter in the StrokeV2 node specifies the blending mode used when applying the stroke color to the layer image."
