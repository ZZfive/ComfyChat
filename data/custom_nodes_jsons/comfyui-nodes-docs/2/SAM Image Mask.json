        "question": "What is the primary function of the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node is to apply a semantic aware segmentation model to an input image and generate a corresponding mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node are sam_model, sam_parameters, and image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sam_model input parameter represent in the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The sam_model input parameter represents the semantic aware segmentation model that will be used to process the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the sam_parameters input in the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The sam_parameters input contains the points and labels necessary for the SAM model to perform the segmentation, directly influencing the outcome of the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node are image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'image' from the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node represent?",
        "answer": "The output 'image' from the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node is the original input image with the predicted mask overlay, allowing for direct visual inspection of the masked areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'mask' from the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node highlight?",
        "answer": "The output 'mask' from the WAS_SAM_Image_Mask node is a binary representation of the segmentation mask, highlighting the areas identified by the SAM model."
