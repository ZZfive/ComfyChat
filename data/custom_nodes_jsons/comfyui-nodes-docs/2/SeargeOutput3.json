        "question": "What is the primary function of the SeargeOutput3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput3 node in ComfyUI encapsulates the logic of decomposing a set of parameters into individual components for further processing and analysis within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the SeargeOutput3 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput3 node requires an input parameter 'parameters' which is a dictionary containing various settings that determine the node's behavior and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeOutput3 node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput3 node outputs the original set of parameters, denoise setting, base ratio, refiner strength, noise offset, precondition steps, batch size, upscale resolution factor, and a flag to save the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'denoise' output of the SeargeOutput3 node contribute to image quality enhancement?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' output of the SeargeOutput3 node represents a denoise setting that is crucial for the process of enhancing image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' output of the SeargeOutput3 node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' output of the SeargeOutput3 node determines the number of images processed simultaneously, affecting the system's efficiency and throughput."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'upscale_resolution_factor' output in the SeargeOutput3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_resolution_factor' output in the SeargeOutput3 node is responsible for defining the scaling factor applied to the image resolution, which is a key factor in achieving the desired output size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'save_upscaled_image' output used for in the SeargeOutput3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'save_upscaled_image' output in the SeargeOutput3 node is a flag that determines whether the processed image should be saved, affecting data persistence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the SeargeOutput3 node use?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput3 node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
