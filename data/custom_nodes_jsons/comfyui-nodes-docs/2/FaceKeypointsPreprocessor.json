        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images to extract and utilize facial keypoints, thereby enhancing facial recognition tasks in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the faceanalysis parameter for the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The faceanalysis parameter is crucial for the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node as it provides the facial analysis model and its associated features necessary for image preprocessing, playing a key role in detecting and extracting facial keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the image parameter in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The image parameter is the input image that the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node processes. It serves as the source for extracting facial keypoints, with its quality and resolution directly affecting the accuracy of facial feature detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output face_kps from the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node represent?",
        "answer": "The output face_kps from the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node represents the facial keypoints extracted from the input image, which are essential for providing a foundation for subsequent facial recognition and analysis tasks, making the identification and understanding of facial features more precise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node handle cases where no face is detected in the input image?",
        "answer": "If no face is detected in the input image, the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node returns a tensor of zeros and prints a warning message indicating the inability to extract keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the extractFeatures function do in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The extractFeatures function in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node is responsible for extracting facial keypoints from the input image using the provided faceanalysis model, with the extract_kps parameter set to True."
