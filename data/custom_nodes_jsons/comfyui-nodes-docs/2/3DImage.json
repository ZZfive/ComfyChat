        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image3D node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image3D node in ComfyUI is designed to process and manipulate 3D images. It accepts a base64 encoded image and optional material as input, converts them into a tensor form suitable for further processing by deep learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Image3D node is the 'upload' parameter, which contains the base64 encoded image data and optional material for processing. It is crucial for the node's execution as it provides the main input for image operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'material' parameter do in the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The 'material' parameter in the Image3D node is optional and allows for additional image data that can be used to enhance the main image processing. It adds flexibility to the node's functionality by enabling the use of supplementary visual elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Image3D node include 'IMAGE', 'MASK', 'BG_IMAGE', and 'MATERIAL'. 'IMAGE' represents the processed 3D image in tensor form, 'MASK' provides a binary mask derived from the input image, 'BG_IMAGE' is an optional background image, and 'MATERIAL' is the processed material image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'MASK' output used for in the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The 'MASK' output in the Image3D node provides a binary mask derived from the input image, which can be used for segmentation or other image analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'BG_IMAGE' output represent in the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The 'BG_IMAGE' output in the Image3D node represents an optional background image that complements the main image, enhancing context for certain applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the Image3D node?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the Image3D node is CPU."
