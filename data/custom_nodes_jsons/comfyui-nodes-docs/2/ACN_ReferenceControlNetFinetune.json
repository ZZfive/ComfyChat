        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReferenceControlFinetune node?",
        "answer": "The ReferenceControlFinetune node is a control network fine-tuning node used for advanced image processing tasks. It utilizes attention and adaptive instance normalization mechanisms to achieve high fidelity in style transfer and content adaptation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'attn_style_fidelity' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'attn_style_fidelity' parameter controls the fidelity of the attention mechanism when applying style transformations. It is crucial for balancing the stylization effect and preserving content details, thereby influencing the overall aesthetic result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'adain_ref_weight' parameter affect the image?",
        "answer": "The 'adain_ref_weight' parameter sets the reference weight in adaptive instance normalization, affecting the strength of the reference style applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ReferenceControlFinetune node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ReferenceControlFinetune node is a control network that encapsulates the fine-tuned parameters and mechanisms for advanced style control and manipulation. It is a key component for subsequent image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ReferenceControlFinetune node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ReferenceControlFinetune node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'attn_strength' parameter influence the stylization process?",
        "answer": "The 'attn_strength' parameter adjusts the influence intensity of the attention mechanism on the stylization process, allowing control over the strength of style application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'adain_style_fidelity' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'adain_style_fidelity' parameter determines the fidelity level of adaptive instance normalization when applying styles. It is important for maintaining the integrity of original image features while applying styles."
