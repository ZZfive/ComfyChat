        "question": "What is the purpose of the SparseIndexMethodNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SparseIndexMethodNode is used to retrieve methods of sparse control networks by providing a series of unique indexes. It ensures that the indexes are valid integers and are used to reference specific elements in a larger dataset or structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SparseIndexMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SparseIndexMethodNode is 'indexes', which is a comma-separated string of integers used to uniquely identify elements in the dataset. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly affects which elements are selected for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SparseIndexMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SparseIndexMethodNode is 'method', which is an instance of SparseIndexMethod customized according to the provided indexes. It represents the core functionality of the SparseIndexMethodNode, enabling the selection and processing of specific elements in sparse control networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SparseIndexMethodNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SparseIndexMethodNode is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SparseIndexMethodNode handle duplicate indexes?",
        "answer": "If the SparseIndexMethodNode encounters duplicate indexes, it raises a ValueError indicating that the index is duplicated and indexes must be unique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no indexes are listed in the SparseIndexMethodNode?",
        "answer": "If no indexes are listed in the SparseIndexMethodNode, it raises a ValueError stating that no indexes were listed in the Sparse Index Method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SparseIndexMethodNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SparseIndexMethodNode in ComfyUI is 'Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/SparseCtrl'."
