        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the width and height of an image based on a given aspect ratio, orientation, and length of the shorter side."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'aspect' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node define?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node defines the aspect ratio of the image, which is crucial for determining the correct dimensions. It is a string representing the ratio, such as '16:9'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'direction' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node specifies the orientation of the image, which can be either 'landscape' (horizontal) or 'portrait' (vertical). This parameter is essential as it influences the calculation of width and height, ensuring the dimensions fit the specified orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'shortside' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The 'shortside' parameter in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node represents the length of the shorter side of the image. It is a crucial input because it directly affects the calculation of width and height based on the aspect ratio and orientation, ensuring the width is optimized for display or processing purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'width' in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node represent?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'width' in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node represents the calculated width of the image, taking into account the aspect ratio, orientation, and length of the shorter side. It is important for ensuring the image fits the required display or processing constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output parameter 'height' in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node represent?",
        "answer": "The output parameter 'height' in the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node represents the calculated height of the image, taking into account the aspect ratio, orientation, and length of the shorter side. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the image's proportions and ensuring it meets the display requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the WLSH_Resolutions_by_Ratio node is CPU."
