        "question": "What is the purpose of the OffsetLatentImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OffsetLatentImage node in ComfyUI is designed to manipulate the latent space representation of an image by applying specified offsets to each channel, allowing for low-level adjustment and fine-tuning of the generated image features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the OffsetLatentImage node are width, height, batch_size, and offset_i (where i ranges from 0 to 3)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the width parameter affect the output of the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The width parameter specifies the width of the latent image to be generated, directly influencing the dimensions of the output latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the batch_size parameter in the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The batch_size parameter controls the number of latent images to be generated in a single batch, allowing for efficient batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the offset_i parameter do in the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The offset_i parameter applies a specific offset to the i-th channel of the latent representation, altering its features. The index i ranges from 0 to 3, enabling detailed customization of each channel in the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the OffsetLatentImage node is a modified latent representation of the image with the applied offsets, which can be further processed or used for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the OffsetLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the OffsetLatentImage node is GPU."
