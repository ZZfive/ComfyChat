        "question": "What is the purpose of RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to prepare image data for processing involving sparse control mechanisms in advanced control networks. It enlarges the input image to match latent size, encodes the image into a latent space representation, and wraps the encoded data in a preprocessing format specific to downstream control network applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node are 'image', 'vae', and 'latent_size'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter represents the raw input that will be enlarged and encoded. It is a fundamental element that influences the node's output and subsequent processing in the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae' parameter specify in RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter specifies the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that will be used to encode the image into a latent representation. This model is crucial for transforming the input image into a format suitable for advanced control network operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_size' parameter define in RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_size' parameter defines the dimensionality of the latent space into which the image will be encoded. It is a key determinant of the node's output quality and the encoded data's subsequent applicability within the control network framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node is 'proc_IMAGE', which is a preprocessed version of the input image encoded as a latent space representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for RgbSparseCtrlPreprocessor node is GPU."
