        "question": "What is the purpose of the BasicScheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BasicScheduler node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and compute the schedule of sigma values used in the diffusion process for generating images. It abstracts away the complexity of determining the appropriate sigmas for each step, ensuring a smooth and coherent sampling process."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'model' parameter in the BasicScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter is crucial for the BasicScheduler node as it represents the underlying model used for sampling. It influences how the scheduler calculates sigmas and is essential for the execution of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scheduler' parameter affect the output of the BasicScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' parameter defines the type of schedule used for sigma calculations. It is a key decision factor in the sampling process, directly influencing the output sigmas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'steps' parameter play in the BasicScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter specifies the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process. It is an important component in controlling the granularity of the sampling, affecting the quality of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'denoise' parameter in the BasicScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' parameter adjusts the level of noise reduction applied in the sampling process. It plays a significant role in the quality of the final image by affecting its clarity and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigmas' output of the BasicScheduler node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'sigmas' output provides the calculated schedule of sigma values for each step in the sampling process. These values are essential for the diffusion process, directly influencing the quality of the resulting images."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type does the BasicScheduler node operate?",
        "answer": "The BasicScheduler node operates on the CPU infra type."
