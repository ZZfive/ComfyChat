        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node in ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved?",
        "answer": "The ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is used for advanced operations on paired conditioning data for the model, with a focus on applying and combining masks and additional conditioning layers. It enhances or modifies existing conditions by applying masks, adjusting strength, and incorporating new conditioning elements, allowing for more precise control over the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are: positive (original positive conditioning data), negative (original negative conditioning data), positive_ADD (additional positive conditioning data to combine), negative_ADD (additional negative conditioning data to combine), strength (parameter defining the strength of mask or condition modification), and set_cond_area (specifies the area of the condition where the mask or modification is applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are: opt_mask (an optional mask that can be applied to the conditioning data for selective modification), opt_lora_hook (an optional parameter that allows a Lora hook to be applied to the conditioning data, providing an additional transformation or control layer), and opt_timesteps (optional timestep conditioning that allows for time adjustments)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node are positive and negative, both of which are of the Comfy dtype CONDITIONING and Python dtype torch.Tensor. They represent the enhanced or modified positive and negative conditioning data after applying masks, strength adjustments, and combining with additional conditions."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node belong?",
        "answer": "The ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node belongs to the Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used in the source code of the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node?",
        "answer": "The function name used in the source code of the ADE_PairedConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is append_and_combine."
