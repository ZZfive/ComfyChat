        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_TextListSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextListSimple node is designed to efficiently manage and combine multiple text inputs into a single list. It is suitable for applications that require text aggregation, such as preparing data for batch processing or generating combined text outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input parameters for the CR_TextListSimple node?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextListSimple node has optional input parameters: text_1, text_2, text_3, text_4, text_5, and text_list_simple. These parameters allow users to contribute lines of text or include a pre-existing list of text lines to the aggregated list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'text_list_simple' input parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'text_list_simple' input parameter allows users to include a pre-existing list of text lines in the aggregated list. This is useful for those who wish to expand or modify an existing text list without starting from scratch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the CR_TextListSimple node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextListSimple node provides two output types: TEXT_LIST_SIMPLE, which is a merged list of all provided text inputs, and 'show_help', which provides a URL link to the node's documentation page for additional information and guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR_TextListSimple node combine the input texts?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextListSimple node combines the input texts by extending a list called 'texts' with the provided text inputs (text_1, text_2, text_3, text_4, text_5) and the pre-existing text list (text_list_simple), if available. The combined list is then returned as the TEXT_LIST_SIMPLE output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CR_TextListSimple node use?",
        "answer": "The CR_TextListSimple node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can users find additional information and guidance on using the CR_TextListSimple node?",
        "answer": "Users can find additional information and guidance on using the CR_TextListSimple node by accessing the URL link provided in the 'show_help' output, which directs them to the node's documentation page."
