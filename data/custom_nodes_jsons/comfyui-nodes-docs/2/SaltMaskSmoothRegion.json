        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSmoothRegion node is used to apply a smooth filter to the mask area, controlling the degree of smoothness through the specified sigma value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node on the visual quality of the mask region?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSmoothRegion node improves the visual quality of the mask region by reducing noise and irregularities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node are masks and sigma. Masks represent the input masks that need to be smoothed, and sigma controls the smoothness of the filter applied to the mask area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node is MASKS, which represents the mask tensor after the smoothing process according to the specified sigma value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the sigma parameter in the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the sigma parameter in the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node is 5.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum value for the sigma parameter in the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The minimum value for the sigma parameter is 0.0, and the maximum value is 128.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node is GPU."
