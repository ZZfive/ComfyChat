        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWIntegerToFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerToFloat node in ComfyUI is designed to convert integer inputs to their floating-point representation. This conversion allows numerical data to be stored in a format that can accommodate fractions, facilitating operations that require fractional values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the JWIntegerToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the JWIntegerToFloat node is an integer value that needs to be converted to a floating-point number. This input is crucial for the operation as it determines the exact numerical data that will undergo the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWIntegerToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWIntegerToFloat node is a floating-point representation of the input integer. This output is important because it allows the converted value to be used in scenarios that require floating-point precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the JWIntegerToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the JWIntegerToFloat node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWIntegerToFloat node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWIntegerToFloat node is not an output node. It is indicated as 'Output node: False' in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWIntegerToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWIntegerToFloat node is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the source code provided for the JWIntegerToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The source code provided for the JWIntegerToFloat node defines the class for the node, specifying its category, input and output types, and the function to be executed when the node is used."
