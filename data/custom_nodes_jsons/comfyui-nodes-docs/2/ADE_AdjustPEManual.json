        "question": "What is the purpose of the ManualAdjustPENode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ManualAdjustPENode is designed to manually adjust parameters related to PE (Personal Energy) in the animation workflow. It allows fine-tuning of initial and final PE indices, interpolation to a specific length, and provides an option to print the adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the cap_initial_pe_length parameter do in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The cap_initial_pe_length parameter defines the initial length of the PE to be limited. It is crucial for controlling the starting energy level in the animation and directly affects the energy dynamics and overall feel of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the interpolate_pe_to_length parameter work in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The interpolate_pe_to_length parameter allows the PE to smoothly transition to a specified length, ensuring a harmonious flow of energy in the animation. It is a key factor in achieving a natural progression of energy levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the initial_pe_idx_offset parameter in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The initial_pe_idx_offset parameter is used to adjust the starting index of the PE, which can significantly change the initial energy state of the animation. It provides a way to fine-tune the energy input at the beginning of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the final_pe_idx_offset parameter affect the animation in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The final_pe_idx_offset parameter is crucial for defining the ending energy state of the animation. It allows for precise control over how the energy is resolved at the end of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the print_adjustment parameter in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The print_adjustment parameter is a boolean flag that determines whether the adjustments made to the PE will be printed out. It is useful for debugging and understanding the impact of the adjustments on the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the optional prev_pe_adjust parameter in the ManualAdjustPENode?",
        "answer": "The prev_pe_adjust parameter provides a way to build upon existing adjustments, allowing for cumulative effects in the animation. It is an optional parameter that enhances the flexibility of the node's functionality."
