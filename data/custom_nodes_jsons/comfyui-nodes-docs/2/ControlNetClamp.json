        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetClamp node in ComfyUI is designed to pass control network data through unchanged, acting as a 'clamp' to ensure the integrity and original state of the control network information within the data processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ControlNetClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ControlNetClamp node is 'control_net_clamp', which represents the data to be passed through unchanged, emphasizing the node's role in maintaining the original state of the control network information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the input for the ControlNetClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the input 'control_net_clamp' for the ControlNetClamp node is 'CONTROL_NET'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the input for the ControlNetClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the input 'control_net_clamp' for the ControlNetClamp node is 'tuple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetClamp node is 'control_net', which represents the unmodified control network data, maintaining the integrity of the original input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy data type of the output for the ControlNetClamp node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type of the output 'control_net' for the ControlNetClamp node is 'CONTROL_NET'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output for the ControlNetClamp node?",
