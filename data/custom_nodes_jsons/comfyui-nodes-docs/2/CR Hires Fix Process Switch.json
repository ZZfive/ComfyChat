        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node serves as a decision unit that selects between two upscaling processes based on the provided input. It aims to improve the efficiency and flexibility of image processing tasks by intelligently routing the processing to either latent or image upscaling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'Input' parameter in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter is crucial in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node as it determines the path selection for the upscaling process. It influences whether the node will invoke the latent or image upscaling method, thus affecting subsequent processing and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "When is the 'latent_upscale' parameter used in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_upscale' parameter in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node is used when the 'Input' parameter specifies the latent upscaling process. It is important as it carries the latent representation that will be upscaled, affecting the quality and resolution of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "When is the 'image_upscale' parameter used in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_upscale' parameter in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node is utilized when the 'Input' parameter indicates the image upscaling process. It is essential as it contains the image data that will be processed for upscaling, directly influencing the visual enhancement of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'LATENT' output represent in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'LATENT' output in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node represents the result of the selected upscaling process, whether from latent or image upscaling. It contains the data that has undergone the specified enhancement process, available for further use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'STRING' output provide in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'STRING' output in the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node provides a URL link to the node's help documentation. This is particularly useful for users seeking additional guidance or understanding of the node's functionality and usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch node is CPU."
