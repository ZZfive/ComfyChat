    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node are 'poses', 'fx', 'fy', 'cx', and 'cy'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'poses' input represent in the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'poses' input represents the parameters of the camera poses to be modified. It plays a key role in determining the final output by specifying the initial camera positions and orientations for adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node is 'cameractrl_poses', which represents the modified camera poses after applying the new camera parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node modify the camera poses?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ReplaceCameraParameters node modifies the camera poses by adjusting the 'fx', 'fy', 'cx', and 'cy' values in the 19-long pose list of each pose."
