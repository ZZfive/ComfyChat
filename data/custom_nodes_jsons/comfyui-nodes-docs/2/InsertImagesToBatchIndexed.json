        "question": "What is the purpose of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is designed to insert specified images into specific positions of the original image batch, effectively modifying the original sequence by adding new images at designated locations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node are: original_images (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), images_to_insert (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), and indexes (Comfy dtype: STRING, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'indexes' parameter in the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'indexes' parameter in the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is a comma-separated string of indices that indicates where the new images should be inserted into the original batch, determining the positions at which the images will be added and affecting the final arrangement of the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), which represents the modified image batch after inserting new images at the specified indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node modify the original image batch?",
        "answer": "The InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node modifies the original image batch by iterating over the specified indices and inserting the corresponding images from the 'images_to_insert' input at those positions, replacing the original images at those indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used by the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The function name used by the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is 'insertimagesfrombatch'."
