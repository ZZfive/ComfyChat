        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN_text7BOX_concat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN_text7BOX_concat node is designed to concatenate up to seven text inputs into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate each text input. This functionality allows for flexible text manipulation and aggregation, suitable for scenarios where multiple text segments need to be combined in a structured manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ttN_text7BOX_concat node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ttN_text7BOX_concat node are text1, text2, text3, text4, text5, text6, text7, and delimiter, all of which are of the STRING data type in ComfyUI and str data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ttN_text7BOX_concat node handle empty or undefined text inputs?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the ttN_text7BOX_concat node, empty or undefined text inputs are replaced with an empty string '' before the concatenation process, ensuring that the final concatenated string only contains non-empty text inputs separated by the specified delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the concatenated string in the ttN_text7BOX_concat node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the concatenated string in the ttN_text7BOX_concat node is STRING in ComfyUI and str in Python. The final concatenated string is composed of up to seven text inputs, separated by the specified delimiter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the delimiter input in the ttN_text7BOX_concat node?",
        "answer": "The delimiter input in the ttN_text7BOX_concat node specifies the character or sequence of characters used to separate each text input in the concatenated output, allowing for customization of the output format."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ttN_text7BOX_concat node handle the '\\n' delimiter input?",
        "answer": "In the source code of the ttN_text7BOX_concat node, if the delimiter input is '\\n', it is replaced with '\n' to ensure that the concatenated string uses the newline character as the separator between text inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the ttN_text7BOX_concat node use?",
        "answer": "The ttN_text7BOX_concat node uses the 'CPU' infra type."
