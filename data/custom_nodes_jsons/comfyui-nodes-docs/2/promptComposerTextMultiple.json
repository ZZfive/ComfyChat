        "question": "What is the purpose of the promptComposerTextMultiple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The promptComposerTextMultiple node is designed to combine multiple text inputs into a single, cohesive prompt. It intelligently applies weights to each text entry, allowing for nuanced control over the influence of each component. This node is particularly adept at crafting prompts that balance the importance of various textual elements, ensuring the output is a carefully crafted aggregate serving the intended purpose."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the text_in_opt input in the promptComposerTextMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The text_in_opt input serves as optional text input that can be included in the final prompt composition. It plays a role in providing supplementary context or details that may enrich the overall prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the weight_1 parameter affect the prompt composition in the promptComposerTextMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The weight_1 parameter allows for adjusting the relative importance of the first text input in the prompt. It is a key factor in determining the overall balance and emphasis of the combined prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the active flag determine in the promptComposerTextMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The active flag determines whether to consider the text input and its associated weight in the prompt composition. It serves as a toggle to include or exclude certain parts of the input data based on the node's execution context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the promptComposerTextMultiple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the promptComposerTextMultiple node is a comprehensive prompt generated by combining the weighted text inputs. It encapsulates the essence of the provided texts, reflecting the intended emphasis and balance of information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the promptComposerTextMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the promptComposerTextMultiple node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the promptComposerTextMultiple node handle the combination of weighted text inputs?",
        "answer": "The promptComposerTextMultiple node appends each non-empty weighted text input to a prompt list if the corresponding weight is greater than 0 and the active flag is True. It then joins the prompt elements with a comma and converts the resulting string to lowercase."
