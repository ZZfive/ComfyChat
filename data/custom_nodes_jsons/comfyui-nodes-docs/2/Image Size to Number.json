        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node is designed to extract the dimensions of an image and convert them into numerical values, providing a direct method to obtain the width and height of an image in different formats for further processing or analysis that requires numerical dimension information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node is an image, which is crucial for the node's operation as it is the source from which the dimensions are extracted. It directly affects the output of the node by determining the numerical values returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width_num' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'width_num' output represents the integer value of the image width. It is important as it provides a numerical measure of the image width that can be used for various purposes such as resizing or layout calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'height_float' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'height_float' output provides a floating-point value of the image height, which is useful for applications that require high precision in vertical measurements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the return types of the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The return types of the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node are NUMBER, NUMBER, FLOAT, FLOAT, INT, and INT, representing the width and height in different numerical formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node?",
        "answer": "The category of the WAS_Image_Size_To_Number node is 'WAS Suite/Number/Operations'."
