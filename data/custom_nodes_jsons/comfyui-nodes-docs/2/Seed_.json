        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateSeedNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateSeedNode in ComfyUI is used to generate seed values for various randomization processes, ensuring that randomness can be controlled and replicated when needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the seed parameter in CreateSeedNode?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter is crucial for initializing the random number generator and can produce repeatable and predictable results in random processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the seed parameter in CreateSeedNode?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the seed parameter has the data type INT, and in Python, it has the data type int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output seed value represent in CreateSeedNode?",
        "answer": "The output seed value serves as a reference for the initialized randomization process, indicating the specific state from which randomness is derived."
