        "question": "What is the purpose of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is to enhance image segmentation tasks by applying a preprocessing step that simulates scribbles, utilizing the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) algorithm to create prompt images that aid in the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'safe' parameter in the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' parameter in the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node determines whether safety measures should be taken during the preprocessing to prevent potential data corruption or loss, ensuring the integrity of the input data during the preprocessing stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessed image that can be directly used as input for a segmentation model, enhancing the model's ability to produce accurate segmentations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is an image, represented as PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the FakeScribblePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is CPU."
