        "question": "What does the SamplerCustom node aim to facilitate?",
        "answer": "The SamplerCustom node aims to facilitate the generation process in models by combining various components like noise enrichment, model handling, and potential image manipulation to produce high-quality outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'add_noise' parameter in SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' parameter in SamplerCustom determines whether noise should be added to the latent image during the sampling process. If set to false, no noise is added, affecting the diversity and randomness of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input type 'required' represent for the SamplerCustom node?",
        "answer": "For the SamplerCustom node, the 'model' input type 'required' refers to the model parameters which are crucial for defining the generation model used in the sampling process, directly influencing the quality and type of the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'sampler' parameter have on the SamplerCustom node?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler' parameter in the SamplerCustom node determines the type of sampling method to be used, which can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'cfg' parameter in SamplerCustom adjust the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' parameter in SamplerCustom is used to tweak the configuration of the sampling process, enabling users to control aspects such as the fidelity and level of detail in the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible output types from the SamplerCustom node?",
        "answer": "The output from the SamplerCustom node can include the 'output' parameter, representing the main result of the sampling process, and the 'denoised_output' parameter, providing a denoised version of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' parameter in SamplerCustom represent?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter in SamplerCustom serves as the representation of the input latent space at the beginning of the sampling process."
