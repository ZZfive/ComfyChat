        "question": "What is the purpose of the FloatRange node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange node in ComfyUI is used to generate a series of floating-point numbers starting from a specified value and ending at another value, incrementing by a defined step size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FloatRange node are: start (FLOAT), stop (FLOAT), step (FLOAT), limit (INT), and ensure_end (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'ensure_end' flag affect the output of the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "When the 'ensure_end' flag is enabled, the FloatRange node ensures that the stop value is included in the generated sequence, adjusting the sequence if necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FloatRange node is a list of floating-point numbers (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the FloatRange node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the FloatRange node is CPU."

    {
        "question": "In what category is the FloatRange node located in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange node is located in the InspirePack/Util category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FloatRange node generate the sequence of floating-point numbers?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange node generates the sequence of floating-point numbers by starting from the 'start' value and incrementing by the 'step' size until it reaches the 'stop' value or the 'limit' is reached. If the 'ensure_end' flag is enabled, the stop value will be included in the sequence, adjusting the sequence if necessary."
