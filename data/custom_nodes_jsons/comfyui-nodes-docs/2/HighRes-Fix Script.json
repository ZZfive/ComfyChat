        "question": "What is the purpose of the HighRes-Fix Script node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HighRes-Fix Script node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image resolution and quality in a customizable way. It utilizes various upscaling techniques, control nets, and preprocessing steps to optimize images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the HighRes-Fix Script node include upscale_type, hires_ckpt_name, latent_upscaler, pixel_upscaler, upscale_by, use_same_seed, seed, hires_steps, denoise, iterations, use_controlnet, control_net_name, strength, preprocessor, and preprocessor_imgs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_by' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_by' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node determines the scale factor of the upscaling process, which directly affects the final image's size and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_same_seed' parameter influence the upscaling process in the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_same_seed' parameter controls whether the same seed is used throughout the upscaling process, ensuring consistency in random elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'preprocessor' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The 'preprocessor' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node specifies the preprocessing method used to prepare the image for upscaling, affecting initial quality and compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'iterations' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' parameter in the HighRes-Fix Script node indicates the number of times the upscaling process is run, allowing for multiple refinements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the HighRes-Fix Script node is a script configuration that encapsulates all the parameters specified and adjustments made during the high-resolution fixing process."
