        "question": "What is the purpose of the TextCombinations2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations2 node is designed to generate a series of text operations that combine two input texts in a defined manner. It facilitates the creation of output texts by performing specified operations on the inputs, providing flexibility in text processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the TextCombinations2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the TextCombinations2 node are 'text1', 'text2', and 'operation'. 'text1' and 'text2' are the two input texts to be combined, while 'operation' defines the specific combination operation to be performed on the input texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'operation' parameter in the TextCombinations2 node define?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' parameter in the TextCombinations2 node defines the specific combination operation to be executed on the input texts. It is crucial as it determines how 'text1' and 'text2' are transformed into the desired output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'delimiter' parameter in the TextCombinations2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'delimiter' parameter specifies the character or string to be used when connecting text components during the operation. It influences the format of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_seed' parameter affect the operation selection process in the TextCombinations2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_seed' parameter determines whether a seed value should be used to select an operation from a predefined list of operations. It adds randomness or specificity to the operation selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'seed' parameter in the TextCombinations2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is an integer value that, when 'use_seed' is set to true, is used to offset the selection of the operation. It ensures that a specific operation is selected based on the provided integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the TextCombinations2 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the TextCombinations2 node are 'output1' and 'output2'. 'output1' represents the first resulting text after the combination operation, and 'output2' represents the second resulting text derived from the inputs and the executed operation."
