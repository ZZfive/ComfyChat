        "question": "What is the purpose of the AddAlpha node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddAlpha node in ComfyUI is designed to add an alpha channel to RGB images, enabling transparency operations on the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the AddAlpha node is the 'rgb_image' parameter, which is the RGB image that needs an alpha channel added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does the AddAlpha node accept?",
        "answer": "The AddAlpha node accepts two optional inputs: 'alpha', which is the optional alpha channel to be added to the RGB image, and 'method', which determines how the alpha channel is applied to the RGB image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the AddAlpha node produce?",
        "answer": "The AddAlpha node outputs the 'image' parameter, which is the resulting image with the added alpha channel, enabling transparency operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available methods for applying the alpha channel in the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The available methods for applying the alpha channel in the AddAlpha node are 'default', which directly uses the provided alpha channel, and 'invert', which inverts the provided alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the AddAlpha node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AddAlpha node handle the alpha channel if no alpha input is provided?",
        "answer": "If no alpha input is provided, the AddAlpha node converts the RGB image to RGBA format using OpenCV, allowing for transparency operations without modifying the alpha channel."
