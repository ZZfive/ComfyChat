        "question": "What is the purpose of the BboxDetectorForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorForEach node is designed to detect bounding boxes for each segment in an image using a specified detector. It processes the image with a given threshold, applies dilation to refine the detections, and allows customization through parameters like crop factor and drop size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the bbox_detector parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The bbox_detector parameter is crucial for the BboxDetectorForEach node as it defines the detector that will be used to identify bounding boxes within the image. It plays a key role in the node's execution and the accuracy of the detection results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the dilation parameter affect the detection process in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The dilation parameter is important for refining the detected bounding boxes by expanding their boundaries. It allows for adjustments to the size and shape of the detected segments, which is particularly useful when dealing with images of different resolutions or when a higher level of detail is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the drop_size parameter play in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The drop_size parameter determines the size of the segments that are dropped during the detection process. It is a key factor in controlling the granularity of the detection, allowing for a balance between the number of detected segments and the computational resources required."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the labels parameter be used to customize the detection process in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The labels parameter allows users to specify the types of segments they are interested in. By filtering out unwanted segments, it enables selective detection, which can simplify subsequent processing steps and focus on the most important parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the detailer_hook parameter in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The detailer_hook parameter provides a mechanism for customizing the detection process with additional details or post-processing steps. It is particularly useful for integrating the node with other systems or applying domain-specific logic to the detection results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the segs output represent in the BboxDetectorForEach node?",
        "answer": "The segs output represents the collection of segments detected in the image. It is the main result of the BboxDetectorForEach node's operation and contains the bounding boxes and associated metadata for each segment."
