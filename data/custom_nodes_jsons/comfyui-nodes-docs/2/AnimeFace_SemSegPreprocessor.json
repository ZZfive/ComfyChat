        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node is used to preprocess images for anime face semantic segmentation tasks. It segments anime faces from the background using a specialized model and prepares the image and mask for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type is 'image', which is the input image to be processed for anime face segmentation. The optional input types are 'remove_background_using_abg', a flag to determine if the background should be removed during segmentation, and 'resolution', the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'remove_background_using_abg' flag do in the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'remove_background_using_abg' flag determines whether the background should be removed from the image during the segmentation process. This affects the output of the mask and the segmented image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output types are 'IMAGE', which is the segmented anime face image with the background optionally removed, and 'ABG_CHARACTER_MASK (MASK)', which is a mask indicating the segmented anime face region in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default resolution for the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default resolution for the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node is 512."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimeFace_SemSegPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation' category in ComfyUI."
