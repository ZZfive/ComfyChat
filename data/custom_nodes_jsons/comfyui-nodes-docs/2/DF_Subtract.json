        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Subtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Subtract node in ComfyUI is designed to perform subtraction operations between two input values and return their difference as output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DF_Subtract node belong to?",
        "answer": "The DF_Subtract node belongs to the Derfuu_Nodes/Math category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Subtract node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Subtract node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Subtract node requires two input values: Value_A and Value_B, both of which are of FLOAT data type in ComfyUI and float data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Value_A input represent in the DF_Subtract node?",
        "answer": "Value_A represents the minuend in the subtraction operation. It is the initial value from which Value_B will be subtracted, playing a key role in the node's calculation result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Value_B input represent in the DF_Subtract node?",
        "answer": "Value_B represents the subtrahend in the subtraction operation. Its value is subtracted from Value_A, directly affecting the difference result output by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Subtract node is a float value, which represents the difference obtained by subtracting Value_B from Value_A."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the DF_Subtract node use?",
        "answer": "The DF_Subtract node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
