        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_LoadCameraPoses node is designed to load camera control poses from a specified file, facilitating the manipulation and animation of camera positions within the Animate Diff framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node is 'pose_filename', which specifies the name of the file from which to load the camera control poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the pose_filename input represent in the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node?",
        "answer": "The pose_filename input in the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node represents the name of the file that contains the desired camera poses, allowing the node to retrieve and utilize these poses for animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node is 'cameractrl_poses', which outputs a series of camera control poses structured as lists of floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the camera control poses structured in the output of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node?",
        "answer": "In the output of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node, the camera control poses are structured as lists of floating-point numbers, representing the camera's position, orientation, and other relevant parameters in the animation context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_LoadCameraPoses node process the pose file?",
        "answer": "The ADE_LoadCameraPoses node processes the pose file by reading its content, skipping the first line (which is a link to the source), and treating the rest as a header-less CSV file separated by single spaces. It then converts the pose data into a list of lists of floats, representing the camera poses."
