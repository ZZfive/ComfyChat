        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffLoraLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to integrate animated diffs into models by loading and processing Lora files, adding dynamic elements to the model's appearance or behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the lora_name parameter in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The lora_name parameter is crucial in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node as it specifies the unique identifier of the Lora file to be loaded, which contains the motion and transformation data required for the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the alpha parameter influence the animated effects applied to the model in AnimateDiffLoraLoader?",
        "answer": "The alpha parameter in AnimateDiffLoraLoader controls the intensity of the animated effects applied to the model, allowing for fine-tuning the prominence of the animated diffs in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the lora_stack parameter play in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The lora_stack parameter is an optional list in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node that accumulates tuples of Lora data and their corresponding alpha values, playing a role in managing multiple layers of animated diffs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node is a list of tuples containing processed Lora data and their corresponding alpha values, which is crucial for further processing and integration into the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the AnimateDiffLoraLoader node use?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffLoraLoader node uses the CPU as its infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the load_lora function in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader class do?",
        "answer": "The load_lora function in the AnimateDiffLoraLoader class loads a Lora file specified by the lora_name parameter, appends a tuple of the loaded Lora data and its corresponding alpha value to the lora_stack list, and returns the updated lora_stack."
