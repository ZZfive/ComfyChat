        "question": "What is the purpose of the XYAny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XYAny node is designed to generate combinations of X and Y values, with the optional inclusion of a third dimension Z to expand these combinations. It helps in creating and labeling these combinations, providing fallback labels and the ability to specify custom labels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the XYAny node are X, Y, X_Label_Fallback, Y_Label_Fallback, and Z_Label_Fallback."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the X input represent in the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The X input represents the primary set of values to be combined. It serves as one axis for generating value pairs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the X_Label_Fallback input in the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The X_Label_Fallback input provides fallback labels for the X values, used when specific labels are not provided. It ensures that each X value has an associated label."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the XYAny node are Z, X_Labels, Y_Labels, and Z_Labels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the XYAny node generate?",
        "answer": "The XYAny node generates outputs including X Values, X Labels, Y Values, Y Labels, Z Values (if Z is provided), Z Labels (if Z is provided), Total Images, and Split Every."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Total Images output represent in the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The Total Images output represents the total number of combinations generated by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the XYAny node handle labeling when custom labels are not provided?",
        "answer": "When custom labels are not provided for X, Y, or Z values, the XYAny node uses the provided fallback labels (X_Label_Fallback, Y_Label_Fallback, Z_Label_Fallback) to ensure each value has an associated label."
