        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node in ComfyUI is designed to handle and validate sampler and scheduler combinations used in generative models. It ensures that the provided sampler and scheduler names are valid and compatible, and may adjust them based on predefined constraints to optimize the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node are target_parameter, input_count, sampler_i, and scheduler_i."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target_parameter input specify in the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The target_parameter input in the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node specifies the target parameter of the sampling or scheduling process, indicating the specific aspect that needs to be optimized or adjusted in the generative model operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the sampler_i input in the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The sampler_i input in the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node specifies the index of the sampler to be used, playing a key role in determining the sampling strategy and its compatibility with the scheduler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the scheduler_i input contribute to the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The scheduler_i input in the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node defines the index of the scheduler to be used alongside the sampler, dynamically adjusting the sampling parameters to achieve efficient generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node is either X or Y, representing the processed result, which can be an optimized parameter value (X) or a decision metric (Y), ensuring the effective pairing of samplers and schedulers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type required for the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the XY Input: Sampler_Scheduler node is CPU."
