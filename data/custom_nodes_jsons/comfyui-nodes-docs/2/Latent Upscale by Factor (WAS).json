        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Latent_Upscale class in the WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Latent_Upscale class in the WAS Suite is designed to enhance the resolution of latent representations by applying specified interpolation modes and scale factors, playing a crucial role in ensuring that latent features are accurately and efficiently magnified, thereby contributing to improving the overall quality of generated outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Latent_Upscale method?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Latent_Upscale method are 'samples' which holds the latent representations to be upscaled, 'mode' which defines the interpolation method to be used for upscaling, 'factor' which specifies the scale factor of the upscaling operation, and 'align' which decides whether to use corner aligned scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method specify?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method specifies the interpolation method to be used for upscaling. It is crucial because it determines the algorithmic approach to increasing the resolution, thereby influencing the quality of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'factor' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method specifies the scale factor of the upscaling operation. It is a key determinant in the transformation process as it controls the degree of magnification applied to the latent samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'align' parameter affect the upscaling process in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method?",
        "answer": "The 'align' parameter in the WAS_Latent_Upscale method determines whether to use corner aligned scaling. This choice can have subtle but observable effects on the final upscaled representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Latent_Upscale method?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Latent_Upscale method is 'upscaled_samples', which contains the magnified latent representations produced by the transformation. It is important because it represents the direct result of the node operation, containing the upscaled features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the WAS_Latent_Upscale method?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the WAS_Latent_Upscale method is GPU."
