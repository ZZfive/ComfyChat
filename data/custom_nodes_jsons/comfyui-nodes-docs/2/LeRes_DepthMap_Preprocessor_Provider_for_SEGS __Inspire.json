        "question": "What is the purpose of the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node provides the functionality of preprocessing depth maps using the LeReS algorithm for the SEGS framework in ComfyUI. It is mainly used to remove the nearest and background elements from depth maps and optionally enhance the remaining features to improve the depth perception effect in subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node are 'rm_nearest' and 'rm_background', both of which are of FLOAT data type in ComfyUI and float data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rm_nearest' parameter control in the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'rm_nearest' parameter specifies the extent to which the nearest elements should be removed from the depth map, affecting the clarity and focus of the depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rm_background' parameter control in the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'rm_background' parameter determines the extent to which background elements should be removed from the depth map, improving the overall quality of the depth map by focusing on relevant features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'boost', which is a BOOLEAN data type in ComfyUI and bool data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boost' parameter do when enabled in the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "When the 'boost' parameter is enabled, it enhances the features of the depth map after removing the nearest and background elements, thereby improving the depth perception effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LeRes_DepthMap_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is 'segs_preprocessor', which returns a preprocessed depth map object that can be used for further processing in the SEGS framework."
