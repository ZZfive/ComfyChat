        "question": "What is the purpose of CR_IncrementFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR_IncrementFloat is a node designed to gradually adjust a floating-point value over a specified duration. It helps create dynamic, time-based animations by smoothly transitioning from a starting value to an incremented value based on the current frame in the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CR_IncrementFloat node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CR_IncrementFloat node are: start_value (FLOAT), step (FLOAT), start_frame (INT), frame_duration (INT), and current_frame (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_value' parameter represent in CR_IncrementFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_value' parameter represents the initial value from which the increment begins. It serves as the reference point for the node operation and affects the starting point of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'step' parameter influence the animation in CR_IncrementFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' parameter defines the increment step value, which determines the rate of change in the floating-point value per frame. It plays a crucial role in determining the speed of increase or decrease in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frame_duration' parameter in CR_IncrementFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_duration' parameter sets the total number of frames over which the increment occurs. It establishes the duration of the incremental animation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does CR_IncrementFloat node produce?",
        "answer": "CR_IncrementFloat node produces two output types: FLOAT (the incremented floating-point value result based on the current frame) and show_help (a URL link to the node documentation for further help and information)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does CR_IncrementFloat node utilize?",
        "answer": "CR_IncrementFloat node utilizes the CPU infrastructure type."
