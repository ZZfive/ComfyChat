        "question": "What is the purpose of the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StandardStaticContextOptionsNode is used to generate and configure context options for the animation process in ComfyUI. It allows customization of context length, overlap, and other parameters that influence how the animation differentiates between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode are 'context_length' and 'context_overlap'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'context_length' parameter specify?",
        "answer": "The 'context_length' parameter specifies the number of context frames to consider for each animation step."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'fuse_method' parameter affect the animation process?",
        "answer": "The 'fuse_method' parameter determines how different contexts are merged or fused during the animation, which can impact the overall coherence and stylistic consistency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'prev_context' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_context' parameter is used to bring previous context options into the new context, maintaining continuity in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode is 'CONTEXT_OPTIONS', which provides the configured context options that will be used in subsequent steps of the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for the StandardStaticContextOptionsNode?",
