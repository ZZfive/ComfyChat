        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node are clip_vision, init_image, vae, width, height, batch_size, elevation, azimuth, elevation_batch_increment, and azimuth_batch_increment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the clip_vision parameter do in the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The clip_vision parameter is crucial for encoding visual information from images, which is essential for the node to produce accurate and meaningful conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the batch_size parameter affect the performance of the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The batch_size parameter determines the number of operations the node can perform simultaneously, improving the efficiency and throughput of the 3D model conditioning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the elevation and azimuth parameters in the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The elevation parameter specifies the vertical angle of the camera, and the azimuth parameter defines the horizontal angle. Both are important for creating realistic and contextually accurate conditioning data for 3D models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node are positive conditioning data, negative conditioning data, and latent data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the positive output represent in the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The positive output provides a set of conditioning data representing the desired state of the 3D model, serving as guidance for model generation and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the negative output in the StableZero123_Conditioning_Batched node?",
        "answer": "The negative output provides a complementary set of conditioning data, defining the undesired state of the 3D model, which helps refine and constrain the generation process."
