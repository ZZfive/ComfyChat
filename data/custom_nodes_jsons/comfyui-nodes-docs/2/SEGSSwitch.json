    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'select' parameter in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter is crucial for determining which input the GeneralSwitch node will process. It indicates the selection index used by the node to identify the correct input for further operation in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sel_mode' parameter influence the behavior of the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'sel_mode' parameter allows users to specify whether the selection should be based on the prompt or the execution context. This can affect how the node interprets and responds to inputs, influencing the overall behavior of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'unique_id' parameter play in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'unique_id' parameter is used to internally identify the specific node within a workflow. It plays a vital role in the node's ability to reference its own inputs and configuration settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'extra_pnginfo' parameter contribute to the functionality of the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_pnginfo' parameter contains additional information about the visual representation of the node in the workflow. It helps in customizing the appearance of the node and providing relevant contextual information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'selected_value' output represent in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_value' output represents the data selected based on the input index. It is a crucial component of the node's operation as it determines the data that will be passed on for subsequent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'selected_label' output provide in the GeneralSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'selected_label' output provides the label associated with the selected input. This is useful for providing context or additional information about the data being processed."
