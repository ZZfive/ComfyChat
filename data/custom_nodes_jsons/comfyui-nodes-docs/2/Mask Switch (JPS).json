        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to select and output one mask from multiple input masks based on a given selection index, enabling dynamic mask switching in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Mask Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Switch node belongs to the JPS Nodes/Switches category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Mask Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Mask Switch node is 'select', which specifies the index of the mask to be selected and outputted. It is of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Mask Switch node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the Mask Switch node are 'mask_1' to 'mask_5', representing any optional mask inputs that can be selected for output based on the 'select' index. They are of Comfy dtype MASK and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Mask Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Mask Switch node is 'mask_out', which is the selected mask based on the input selection index. It is of Comfy dtype MASK and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for the Mask Switch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Mask Switch node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Mask Switch node determine which mask to output?",
        "answer": "The Mask Switch node determines which mask to output by comparing the 'select' input value with integers 1 to 5, and selecting the corresponding mask input (mask_1 to mask_5) based on the match."
