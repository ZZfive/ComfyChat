        "question": "What is the purpose of the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node is designed to efficiently manage and store data associated with numeric keys in backend systems. It serves as a crucial component of the caching mechanism, ensuring quick access to frequently used data without redundant retrieval processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'key' parameter in the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node?",
        "answer": "The 'key' parameter is a numeric identifier used to reference and access the data stored in the cache. It plays a vital role in the node's operations as it directly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'tag' parameter in the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node?",
        "answer": "The 'tag' parameter is a string that provides a brief description or label for the data associated with the key. It helps organize and identify the cached data, enhancing the overall functionality of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'data' parameter represent in the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' parameter represents the actual data to be cached. It is crucial to the node's operations as it is the primary content that will be stored and retrieved upon request."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node is 'data opt', which provides the requested data from the cache, ensuring the node fulfills its purpose of efficient data retrieval and storage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node use?",
        "answer": "The CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node uses the CPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node store data in the cache?",
        "answer": "The CacheBackendDataNumberKeyList node stores data in the cache using the provided 'key', 'tag', and 'data' inputs. It assigns the 'tag' and 'data' to the corresponding 'key' in the global cache dictionary."
