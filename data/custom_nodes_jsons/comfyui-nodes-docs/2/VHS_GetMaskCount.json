        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetMaskCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetMaskCount node is designed to process and calculate the number of masks present in a given video frame. It plays a key role in video analysis by providing a straightforward method to determine the quantity of masks, which is crucial for various applications in the field of video processing, such as object detection or segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'mask' parameter for the GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter is essential for the GetMaskCount node because it represents the video frame containing the masks to be counted. Its importance lies in the fact that the node's functionality entirely depends on the input masks to perform its counting operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'count' output parameter represent in the GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output parameter represents the total number of masks identified in the input video frame. It is significant because it directly reflects the result of the node's operation, providing a quantitative measure of the presence of masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for the GetMaskCount node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the GetMaskCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetMaskCount node belongs to the Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/mask category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input and output types of the GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The GetMaskCount node requires an input of type MASK (Comfy dtype) or torch.Tensor (Python dtype) for the 'mask' parameter. It outputs an integer value representing the count of masks, with a Comfy dtype of INT and a Python dtype of int."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the GetMaskCount node implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The GetMaskCount node is implemented using a class named GetMaskCount, which defines the input types, category, return types, return names, and the main function 'count_input'. The 'count_input' function takes a mask tensor as input and returns a tuple containing the size of the first dimension of the mask tensor, representing the number of masks."
