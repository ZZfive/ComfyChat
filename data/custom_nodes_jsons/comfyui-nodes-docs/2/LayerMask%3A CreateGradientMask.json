        "question": "What is the difference between CreateGradientMask and MaskGradient?",
        "answer": "The documentation notes that there is a difference between CreateGradientMask and MaskGradient, but the specific difference is not mentioned in the provided text."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the CreateGradientMask node are: image, width, height, gradient_side, gradient_scale, gradient_offset, and opacity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gradient_side' parameter specify?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_side' parameter specifies the side from which the gradient is generated. It has five directions: top, bottom, left, right, and center."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'gradient_scale' parameter?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'gradient_scale' parameter is 100, which means the gradient produces one side completely transparent and the other side completely opaque."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'opacity' parameter control?",
        "answer": "The 'opacity' parameter controls the opacity of the gradient, with a range from 0 to 100."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CreateGradientMask node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CreateGradientMask node are 'image' and 'mask', both of which are of the Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the CreateGradientMask node use?",
        "answer": "The CreateGradientMask node uses the GPU infrastructure type."
