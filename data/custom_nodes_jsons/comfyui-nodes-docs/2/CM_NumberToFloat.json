        "question": "What is the purpose of the NumberToFloat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NumberToFloat node in ComfyUI is designed to convert the input number to a floating-point format, ensuring accuracy and consistency in numerical calculations across different data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node is the input number that the node intends to convert to a floating-point value. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly affects the numerical representation of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node is NUMBER."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'a' parameter in the NumberToFloat node is Union[int, float, str]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'result' output represent in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The 'result' output in the NumberToFloat node represents the converted floating-point number derived from the input. It is important as it represents the main output of the node and the final result of the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'result' output in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'result' output in the NumberToFloat node is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'result' output in the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'result' output in the NumberToFloat node is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the NumberToFloat node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the NumberToFloat node is CPU."
