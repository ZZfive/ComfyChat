    "reference_text": "I want to fine-tune a large language model. I need to build a fine-tuning dataset, which requires generating a lot of question-answer data pairs. You need to understand the document content I input, then construct the question and answer data pair yourself, and return it in json format. The documentation I'm passing on is all about ComfyUI (a GUI that uses a stable diffusion model to generate images and videos) and custom nodes or plugins that extend its functionality. When building question and answer data, it must be clear whether the subject is for ComfyUI or a specific custom node or plug-in. The subject in the Q&A data must carry the specific name of the node or plug-in, such as the \"ComfyUI-Manager\" extension; do not just use \"extension\" or \"custom node\" as the subject, which does not indicate that the question is about the specific name of the Node or plug-in. You need adjust the number of generated question-answer data pairs based on the length of the passed in text, but generate at least seven question-answer data pairs each time.",
