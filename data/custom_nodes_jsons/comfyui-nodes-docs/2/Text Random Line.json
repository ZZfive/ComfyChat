        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Text_Random_Line class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Random_Line class in ComfyUI is designed to select a random line from a given text input. It serves as a tool suitable for applications that require random sampling of text lines, such as in data preprocessing or content generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class is the input text from which a random line will be selected. It plays a key role in determining the content pool for the random selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring the reproducibility of the random line selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Text_Random_Line class?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Text_Random_Line class is 'random_line', which represents the randomly selected line from the input text. It is the main result of the node operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for running the WAS_Text_Random_Line class?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Text_Random_Line class requires a CPU as the infrastructure type for its operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the text_random_line function in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class?",
        "answer": "The return type of the text_random_line function in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class is a tuple containing a single string, which represents the randomly selected line from the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the text_random_line function in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class select a random line?",
        "answer": "The text_random_line function in the WAS_Text_Random_Line class selects a random line by splitting the input text into lines, initializing the random seed, and then using the random.choice function to select a random line from the list of lines."
