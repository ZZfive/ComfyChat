        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnimateDiffSettingsNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnimateDiffSettingsNode is designed to generate settings for animating scene diffs. It encapsulates the logic for adjusting position embeddings and weights, which are crucial for the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the AnimateDiffSettingsNode?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the AnimateDiffSettingsNode are 'pe_adjust' and 'weight_adjust'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pe_adjust' parameter do in the AnimateDiffSettingsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'pe_adjust' parameter allows for fine-tuning of position embeddings in the animation. It is essential for achieving the desired spatial distribution and motion of animated elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight_adjust' parameter do in the AnimateDiffSettingsNode?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_adjust' parameter is used to modify the weights associated with animated elements. It plays a crucial role in controlling the intensity and focus of the animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnimateDiffSettingsNode?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnimateDiffSettingsNode is 'ad_settings', which provides a comprehensive set of animation settings adjusted based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'ad_settings' output used in the animation pipeline?",
        "answer": "The 'ad_settings' output is crucial for subsequent steps in the animation pipeline, as it determines how the animated diffs will be reflected in the final rendered scene."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the AnimateDiffSettingsNode?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the AnimateDiffSettingsNode is CPU."
