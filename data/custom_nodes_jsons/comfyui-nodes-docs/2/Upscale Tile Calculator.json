        "question": "What is the purpose of the UpscaleTileCalculator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UpscaleTileCalculator node is designed to efficiently calculate and manage tiling in image upscaling operations. It provides a method to determine the optimal tile size based on the image resolution and the specified tile resolution, ensuring the integrity and quality of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the UpscaleTileCalculator node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'tile_resolution' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tile_resolution' parameter define in the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_resolution' parameter defines the desired resolution of each tile in the image. It plays a key role in determining the tile size, thus affecting the efficiency and quality of the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the UpscaleTileCalculator node are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), 'tile_width' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and 'tile_height' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tile_width' parameter indicate in the output of the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_width' parameter indicates the calculated width of each tile after the upscaling process. It is important as it provides information about the spatial dimensions of the tiles used in the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tile_height' parameter specify in the output of the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_height' parameter specifies the calculated height of each tile after the upscaling process. Together with 'tile_width', it determines the overall structure of the tiles, which is crucial for understanding the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for running the UpscaleTileCalculator node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the UpscaleTileCalculator node is CPU."
