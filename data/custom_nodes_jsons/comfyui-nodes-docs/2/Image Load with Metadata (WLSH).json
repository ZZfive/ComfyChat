        "question": "What is the purpose of the WLSH_Read_Prompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WLSH_Read_Prompt node is designed to process image data by extracting and interpreting embedded metadata, which includes prompts and other parameters that guide the image generation process. It plays a key role in ensuring that the image data is correctly formatted and prepared for subsequent operations in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'verbose' parameter control in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'verbose' parameter controls the level of detail in the output information. When set to 'true', it enables comprehensive logging of node operations, providing valuable insights for debugging and optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'image' parameter in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is crucial as it specifies the source image file that the node will process. It directly affects the quality and characteristics of the image data used in subsequent steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output represent in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output is a preprocessed tensor representation of the input image, ready for further operations and analysis within the system. It is a foundational component for all subsequent image-related operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'positive' output provide in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' output provides the positive prompt associated with the image, which is essential for understanding the desired outcome of the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'negative' output in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' output contains negative prompts, outlining aspects to avoid during image generation. It is crucial for guiding the generation towards the intended direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' output contribute to the image generation process in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' output represents the random seed used for the generation process. It ensures reproducibility and consistency of the results, which is vital for experimentation and comparative analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'steps' output indicate in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' output indicates the number of iterations or steps taken during the image generation process. It influences the level of detail and refinement in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'cfg' output in the WLSH_Read_Prompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' output refers to the configuration scale or parameter that adjusts the settings for image generation. It plays an important role in controlling the overall style and quality of the generated image."
