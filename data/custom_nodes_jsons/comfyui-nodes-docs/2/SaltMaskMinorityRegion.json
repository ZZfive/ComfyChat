        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskMinorityRegion node is designed to identify and separate minority regions in a given set of mask images by applying a threshold to distinguish these regions. It focuses on highlighting less common features in the mask data for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node are 'masks' (representing the mask image set to be processed) and 'threshold' (determining the sensitivity of minority region detection)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node determines the sensitivity of minority region detection, affecting which areas are considered minority regions based on their pixel intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node is a mask tensor, where each mask corresponds to the separated minority regions from the original input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, what is the default value for the 'threshold' parameter?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the default value for the 'threshold' parameter is 128."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the SaltMaskMinorityRegion node in ComfyUI is 'SALT/Masking/Filter'."
