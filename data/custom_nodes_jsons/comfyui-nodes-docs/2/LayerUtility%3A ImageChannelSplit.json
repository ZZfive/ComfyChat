        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageChannelSplit class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageChannelSplit class in ComfyUI is used to split an image into separate channels based on the specified mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageChannelSplit class?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageChannelSplit class are 'image' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'mode' (Comfy dtype: STRING_ONEOF, Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available options for the 'mode' input parameter in the ImageChannelSplit class?",
        "answer": "The available options for the 'mode' input parameter in the ImageChannelSplit class are 'RGBA', 'YCbCr', 'LAB', and 'HSV'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageChannelSplit class?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImageChannelSplit class are 'channel_1', 'channel_2', 'channel_3', and 'channel_4', all of which are of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type specified for the ImageChannelSplit class?",
        "answer": "The infra type specified for the ImageChannelSplit class is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the image_channel_split function process the input image?",
        "answer": "The image_channel_split function processes the input image by converting it to RGBA format, splitting it into separate channels based on the specified mode, and then converting each channel back to a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the image_channel_split function?",
        "answer": "The image_channel_split function returns a tuple of four torch.Tensor objects, representing the separated channels of the input image."
