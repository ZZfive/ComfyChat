        "question": "What is the purpose of the AnyToAny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AnyToAny node is designed to dynamically evaluate and transform input data based on a user-defined function. It abstracts the complexity of applying custom operations to data, allowing for diverse data manipulations and transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AnyToAny node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AnyToAny node are 'v' and 'function'. 'v' represents the input value to be transformed, and 'function' is a string representing a user-defined lambda function that determines how to transform the input value 'v'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AnyToAny node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AnyToAny node is dynamically determined by the user-defined function, demonstrating the node's versatility in handling and transforming various data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type does the AnyToAny node use?",
        "answer": "The AnyToAny node uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the AnyToAny node classified?",
        "answer": "The AnyToAny node is classified in the 'Bmad/⚠️⚠️⚠️' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AnyToAny node evaluate the user-defined function?",
        "answer": "The AnyToAny node evaluates the user-defined function using the 'eval_it' method, which prepares the function text for evaluation and executes it using a lambda expression with the input value 'v'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the AnyToAny node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the AnyToAny node is a Python class definition that includes the initialization, input types, function, category, return types, and the 'eval_it' method for evaluating the user-defined function."
