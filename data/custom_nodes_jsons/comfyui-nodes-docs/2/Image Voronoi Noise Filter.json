        "question": "What is the main purpose of the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node is to generate Voronoi noise patterns from input images, which can be used for creating unique textures or patterns for further image processing or artistic purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node are width, height, density, modulator, and seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' parameter affect the output of the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter defines the width of the output image, which is crucial for determining the overall dimensions of the generated noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'density' parameter control in the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'density' parameter affects the concentration of Voronoi cells in the noise pattern. Higher density values result in finer, more detailed noise textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'seed' parameter play in the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that a repeatable pattern is produced each time the node is run with the same seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'flat' parameter determine in the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'flat' parameter determines whether the noise texture should have a flat or more traditional Voronoi appearance, allowing for different aesthetic effects based on the desired outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS_Image_Voronoi_Noise_Filter node is an image, which represents the resulting Voronoi noise pattern generated by the node."
