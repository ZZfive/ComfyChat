        "answer": "cg-noise replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of cg-noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of cg-noise is to allow for small variations in the initial noise used by ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two main differences between cg-noise and KSampler?",
        "answer": "The two main differences between cg-noise and KSampler are that cg-noise does not require precomputing and storing noise images, and it generates variations using a weight and two seeds instead of using img2img."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in the initial noise?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in the initial noise by using a weight 'x' and two seeds. It generates the noise based on 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does cg-noise require precomputing and storing noise images like KSampler?",
        "answer": "No, cg-noise does not require precomputing and storing noise images like KSampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the weight 'x' affect the noise generated by cg-noise?",
        "answer": "The weight 'x' in cg-noise determines the balance between the variation_seed and the original seed when generating the noise. A higher value of 'x' gives more influence to the variation_seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two seeds used by cg-noise for generating noise variations?",
        "answer": "The two seeds used by cg-noise for generating noise variations are the 'variation_seed' and the original 'seed'."
