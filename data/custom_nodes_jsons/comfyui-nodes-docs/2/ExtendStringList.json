        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendStringList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the ExtendStringList node is to concatenate multiple string lists into a single, extended list. This is particularly useful in scenarios where string data from different sources needs to be aggregated for tasks involving collective string dataset operations or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter specify in the ExtendStringList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in the ExtendStringList node specifies the number of string lists to be concatenated. It determines how many string lists will be merged into the extended list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter is INT."

    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the 'inputs_len' parameter is int."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ExtendStringList node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ExtendStringList node is a resulting list that concatenates all the provided string lists. This list contains all the strings from the input lists in their respective order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output in ComfyUI for the ExtendStringList node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the data type of the output for the ExtendStringList node is STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output in Python for the ExtendStringList node?",
        "answer": "In Python, the data type of the output for the ExtendStringList node is List[str]."
