        "question": "What are the outputs of the ComfyUI_KSamplerTimer custom node?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_KSamplerTimer custom node adds two outputs to the KSampler: GENERATION_TIME_STRING and GENERATION_TIME. GENERATION_TIME_STRING provides the time in seconds as a float string with 2 numbers after the comma, while GENERATION_TIME gives the time in seconds as a float."
