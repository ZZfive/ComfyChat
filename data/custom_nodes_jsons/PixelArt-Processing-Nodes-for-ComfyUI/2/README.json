        "question": "What does the Pixel Art Quantization Node do?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Art Quantization Node converts any image into pixel art by reducing resolution and merging colors into a limited palette."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs provided by the Pixel Art Quantization Node?",
        "answer": "The outputs include a pixelated version of the input image and a color palette with the selected number of colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Pixel Art Scaling Node do?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Art Scaling Node scales pixel art images up or down while maintaining crisp edges. It supports both nearest-neighbor and bicubic scaling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs provided by the Pixel Art Scaling Node?",
        "answer": "The main output is a scaled version of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the PixelArt-Processing-Nodes-for-ComfyUI custom nodes be added to ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "1. Clone or download the repository.\n2. Copy the 'pixelart_processing' folder into the 'custom_nodes' directory of the ComfyUI installation.\n3. Restart ComfyUI.\n4. The new 'Pixel Art Quantization' and 'Pixel Art Scaling' nodes can be found under the 'Image/Processing' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key features of the PixelArt-Processing-Nodes-for-ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Key features include GPU-accelerated pixel art image processing, configurable color quantization, sharp edge preservation during scaling, and output of color palettes for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pixelart_processing' folder contain?",
        "answer": "The 'pixelart_processing' folder contains the custom nodes for pixel art processing in ComfyUI."
