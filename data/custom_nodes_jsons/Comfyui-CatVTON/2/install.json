        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComfyUI installation steps?",
        "answer": "The installation steps for ComfyUI are designed to ensure that the required libraries and tools are correctly set up for running the software. This includes the installation of detectron2, a machine learning library for object detection and segmentation, as well as the optional installation of OpenCV for demonstration and visualization purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the prerequisites for running ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The prerequisites for running ComfyUI include a Linux or macOS operating system with Python ≥ 3.6 installed, PyTorch ≥ 1.4, the torchvision library that matches the PyTorch installation, and OpenCV, which is optional but recommended for demo and visualization."

    {
        "question": "Which version of PyTorch is compatible with the pre-built detectron2?",
        "answer": "The pre-built detectron2 is compatible with certain versions of the official PyTorch release. The required version can be found in the detectoron2 release notes. Users should ensure they have the correct version of PyTorch installed to avoid compatibility issues."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be done if there are issues with pre-built detectron2?",
        "answer": "If there are issues with using the pre-built detectron2, users are advised to uninstall it and try building it from source. This can help ensure that the detectron2 builds with the correct versions of the required libraries, which can resolve issues related to symbol undefined, compilation errors, GPU support, and other common installation issues."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the common installation issues with detectron2.",
        "answer": "The common installation issues with detectron2 include undefined torch/aten/caffe2 symbols or segmentation faults, undefined C++ symbols, issues with GPU support, and undefined CUDA symbols. These issues can be resolved by ensuring the correct versions of the required libraries are installed and by setting the correct environment variables during the compilation and installation processes."
