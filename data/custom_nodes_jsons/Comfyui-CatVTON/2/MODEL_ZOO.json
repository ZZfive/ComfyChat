    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the baselines provided in the documentation?",
        "answer": "The baselines are provided to evaluate the performance of Detectron2 DensePose models trained on COCO train2014 + valminusminival2014 datasets. The baselines help in comparing different configurations and schedules used during training."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the legacy models in the documentation?",
        "answer": "The legacy models are baselines trained using schedules from GÃ¼ler et al, 2018. Examples include R_50_FPN_s1x_legacy and R_101_FPN_s1x_legacy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models use an improved training schedule and Panoptic FPN head?",
        "answer": "The models R_50_FPN_s1x and R_101_FPN_s1x use an improved training schedule and Panoptic FPN head from Kirillov et al, 2019."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional estimation do some models perform?",
        "answer": "Some models, like R_50_FPN_WC1_s1x and R_101_FPN_WC2_s1x, perform additional estimation of confidence in regressed UV coordinates, as described in Neverova et al., 2019."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many baselines are provided for Detectron2 DensePose models?",
        "answer": "The documentation provides a total of 14 baselines for Detectron2 DensePose models, covering legacy models, improved baselines with different heads, and baselines with confidence estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which license are the models available for download?",
        "answer": "All models available for download through the document are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license."
