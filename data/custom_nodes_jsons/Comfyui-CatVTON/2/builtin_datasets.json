        "answer": "To prepare COCO instance/keypoint detection datasets in ComfyUI-Manager, you would need to input specific information about the dataset such as the dataset name, version, and the paths to the annotation files and image directories. Then, you can use the 'preprocess_dataset' function in ComfyUI-Manager to extract the necessary annotations and organize the dataset structure as specified."
