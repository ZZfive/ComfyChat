        "answer": "ComfyUI-Sn0w-Scripts is an extension designed for the ComfyUI GUI that manages LoRa models and enhances the functionality of ComfyUI. It includes nodes for lora management, loading lorners and folders, selecting and stacking loras, developed by sn0w12."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main features of ComfyUI-Sn0w-Scripts?",
        "answer": "The main features include lora management, loading lorna folders, using add default generation, loading loran stacks, automatically applying Lora Models based on similarity to input prompts, and selecting favourite L orange and characters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I use the \"Sn0w KSampler\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Sn0w KSampler\" node is used for sampling and transforming images and text. You can attach it as a conditional input or add customization for the input (e.g., \"$k\\变白-1\"), use it alongside other nodes like \"Prompt Combine\" and \"Character Selector\", and set its properties like \"Input Step\" to control the number of samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the use cases for the \"Lora Tester\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Lora Tester\" node can be used to generate multiple images with specific LoRa models, test various combinations of models, and create previews using the \"ImagesGrid\" plugin. It takes Lora information, spacing, and input prompts to process and output a grid of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the \"Load Lora Folder\" node work?",
        "answer": "This node processes a given prompt to identify and apply the most similar LoRa models of the tags found in the prompt. It calculates the distance between tags and available LoRa model filenames, preserving the first LoRa at the top of the list and the filenames as trees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"Lora Folder\" input in the \"Add Default Generation\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Lora Folder\" input in the \"Add Default Generation\" node is meant to add an extra \"nothing\" at the end of the list, which is used in the \"Lora Tester\" node to generate an image without a LoRa. This ensures that there's a default option for testing without any specific LoRas."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the purpose of the \"Character Selector\" node and how it functions.",
        "answer": "The \"Character Selector\" node is used to select characters and their associated prompts from a JSON file. It loads the \"characters.json\" file and outputs a prompt based on the selected character. Users can customize or add characters to their own \"custom_characters.json\" file, and the node will load all characters from both files if formatted correctly. Characters in the JSON files are displayed with a color code, and the user can select from these characters."
