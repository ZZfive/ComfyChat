        "question": "What is ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-layerdiffuse is an implementation of LayerDiffuse in ComfyUI, which allows generating and manipulating layered images using stable diffusion models."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI-layerdiffuse be installed?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-layerdiffuse can be installed by downloading the repository and unpacking it into the custom_nodes folder in the ComfyUI installation directory or by cloning the repository via GIT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be done after installing ComfyUI-layerdiffuse to ensure proper functionality?",
        "answer": "After installing ComfyUI-layerdiffuse, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the necessary Python dependencies. If there are version conflicts with diffusers, set up separate Python virtual environments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models are currently supported by ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-layerdiffuse currently supports only SDXL and SD15 models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the requirement for the generation dimension to decode RGBA results in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "To decode RGBA results in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse, the generation dimension must be a multiple of 64. Otherwise, a decode error will occur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Generate foreground' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "The 'Generate foreground' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse is used to generate a foreground image with transparency using the LayerDiffuse model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'Generate foreground' and 'Generate foreground (RGB + alpha)' workflows in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "The 'Generate foreground' workflow generates an image with transparency, while the 'Generate foreground (RGB + alpha)' workflow provides more control by generating RGB images and alpha channel masks separately."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Blending (FG/BG)' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse accomplish?",
        "answer": "The 'Blending (FG/BG)' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse blends a given foreground or background image with a generated image using the LayerDiffuse model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Extract FG from Blended + BG' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse?",
        "answer": "The 'Extract FG from Blended + BG' workflow in ComfyUI-layerdiffuse extracts the foreground image from a blended image and a given background image using the LayerDiffuse model."
