        "question": "What is OpenVoice?",
        "answer": "OpenVoice is a state-of-the-art, source-available voice cloning technology targeted at developers and researchers, not end users."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does OpenVoice clone the accent and emotion of the reference voice?",
        "answer": "No, OpenVoice only clones the tone color of the reference speaker. The accent and emotion are controlled by the base speaker TTS model, not cloned by the tone color converter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users change the accent or emotion of the output in OpenVoice?",
        "answer": "Users need to have a base speaker model with the desired accent to change the accent or emotion of the output. OpenVoice provides flexibility for users to integrate their own base speaker model into the framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should users check if the generated speech has bad audio quality?",
        "answer": "Users should check if the reference audio is clean without background noise, not too short, contains speech from only one person, does not have long blank sections, and if they have deleted the 'processed' folder if reusing the same name for the reference audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does OpenVoice support languages other than English?",
        "answer": "Yes, OpenVoice supports any language as long as there is a base speaker in that language. The tone color converter training is done by the OpenVoice team, and base speaker TTS models can be trained using existing open-source repositories or by using the OpenAI TTS model as the base speaker."

        "question": "What should users do if they encounter an error related to Silero during installation?",
        "answer": "If the download fails due to inability to access GitHub, users should manually download the zip from 'https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/zipball/master' and unzip it to '/home/user/.cache/torch/hub/snakers4_silero-vad_master'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is OpenVoice a ready-to-use perfect voice cloning product?",
        "answer": "No, OpenVoice is not a ready-to-use perfect voice cloning product. It is a versatile instant voice cloning technical approach that accelerates the open research community's progress on instant voice cloning."
