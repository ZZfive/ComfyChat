        "question": "What is the purpose of the Size Matcher node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Size Matcher node in ComfyUI takes two images or masks and matches their sizes using various methods, such as cover_crop_center, cover_crop, fit_center, center_dont_resize, fill, crop_larger_center, and crop_larger_topleft."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cover_crop_center method work in the Size Matcher node?",
        "answer": "In the Size Matcher node, the cover_crop_center method expands the smaller image to cover the larger image without changing the aspect ratio, centers it, and then crops any overflowing edges until the sizes match."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fit_center method do in the Size Matcher node?",
        "answer": "The fit_center method in the Size Matcher node expands the smaller image as much as possible to fit inside the larger image without changing the aspect ratio, centers it, and then pads any remaining space until the sizes match."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the center_dont_resize method work in the Size Matcher node?",
        "answer": "In the Size Matcher node, the center_dont_resize method centers the smaller image inside the larger image without changing either sizes, and then pads the smaller image until the sizes match."

        "question": "What is the function of the Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) node in ComfyUI composites two images together, automatically matches the size of the images with various size matching methods (if necessary), and infers the background and makes it transparent if the cutout doesn't have an alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) node be used with Auto Segmentation?",
        "answer": "The Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) node can be used with Auto Segmentation by applying the auto segmentation to the cutout image before compositing it onto the base image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the requirements for installing the Size Matcher and Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) nodes in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "To install the Size Matcher and Paste Cutout on Base Image (Compositing) nodes in ComfyUI, you need to have Python 3.10 or higher installed."
