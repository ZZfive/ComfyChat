        "question": "What does 'Unexpected behaviors' refer to in detectron2?",
        "answer": "The term 'Unexpected behaviors' refers to issues or problems arising in the detectron2 framework when running specific functionalities or processing certain data, despite the output not matching the expected results or behaviors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'Unexpected behaviors' issue typically addressed?",
        "answer": "To address the 'Unexpected behaviors' issue in detectron2, users are instructed to first investigate the problem by detailing the changes they made, the command they ran, and the observed behavior. If the issue cannot be self-diagnosed, users are encouraged to post their issue following a specific template that asks for steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and their environment information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the command to collect detectron2 environment information?",
        "answer": "To collect detectron2 environment information, the user should run the command `wget -nc -q https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/raw/master/detectron2/utils/collect_env.py && python collect_env.py`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who do users turn to for guidance on training a new model in detectron2?",
        "answer": "Users in the detectron2 community expect advice specifically on training new models only if it pertains to issues like (1) inability to reproduce results in the detectron2 model zoo, or (2) identification of detectron2 bugs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it important for users to simplify steps when reporting issues in detectron2?",
        "answer": "Simplifying steps when reporting issues in detectron2 is crucial as it ensures the issue can be reproduced and understood without requiring additional resources or a specific setup, streamlining the troubleshooting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the term 'git diff' refer to in the context of detectron2 issue reporting?",
        "answer": "In the context of detectron2 issue reporting, 'git diff' offers a textual representation of the differences between two code versions, specifically of what changes were made to the codebase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of commit messages in detectron2 issue reporting?",
        "answer": "Commit messages serve to document the code changes made, providing context and clarity to why certain modifications were implemented. In detectron2, they help in understanding the development process and can offer insights into potential causes of unexpected behaviors."
