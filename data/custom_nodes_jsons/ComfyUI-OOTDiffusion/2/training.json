    {
        "question": "How can you customize the training loops in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "You can customize the training loops in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion by either changing the behavior of DefaultTrainer by overwriting its methods in a subclass or starting from tools/plain_train_net.py to implement novel functionalities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is EventStorage in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "EventStorage in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion is a centralized storage where metrics are saved during training."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you access EventStorage and log metrics in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "You can access EventStorage and log metrics in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion by using the code: `from detectron2.utils.events import get_event_storage` and then using `storage = get_event_storage()` and `storage.put_scalar(\"some_accuracy\", value)` within the model."
