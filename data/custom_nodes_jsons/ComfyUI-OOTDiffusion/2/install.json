        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion is designed to enable the use of detectron2, a powerful object detection library, with ComfyUI by utilizing its OOTDiffusion extension."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one install ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "Install detectron2 following the instructions provided in the Colab Notebook or by using the Dockerfile, then add the OOTDiffusion extension to ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main requirements for running ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "Linear or macOS with Python ≥ 3.6, PyTorch ≥ 1.4, torchvision, OpenCV (optional), and pycocotools."
    },
    {
        "question": "What issues can arise and how are they resolved when installing ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
        "answer": "Undeclared symbols or segmentation faults can occur due to inconsistencies in PyTorch and detectron2 versions. It can be resolved by matching versions or rebuilding detectron2. Other issues include undefined C++ symbols, not compiling with GPU support, and undefined CUDA symbols, which need specific version matching or environment variable adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion help in extending the capabilities of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "By integrating detectron2 through the OOTDiffusion extension, ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion allows users to perform object detection tasks such as image segmentation, object proposal, and bounding box regression — efficiently utilizing the GPU for processing and visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of matching the PyTorch and detectron2 versions correctly?",
        "answer": "Matching the versions ensures stable and functional performance of detectron2 with ComfyUI, avoiding compatibility and runtime errors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does pycocotools play a role in the ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion environment?",
        "answer": "pycocotools is necessary for working with the COCO dataset, which is commonly used for training and testing object detection models like those enabled by ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion."
