        "question": "What is query_db?",
        "answer": "query_db is a tool to print or visualize DensePose data from a dataset. It has two modes: print and show, which output dataset entries to standard output or visualize them on images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two mandatory arguments for the print mode of query_db?",
        "answer": "The two mandatory arguments for the print mode of query_db are <dataset>, which specifies the DensePose dataset from which to select the entries, and <selector>, a dataset entry selector that specifies the entries to output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you limit the maximum number of entries output by query_db in print mode?",
        "answer": "You can limit the maximum number of entries output by query_db in print mode by providing the --max-entries argument."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three mandatory arguments for the visualization mode of query_db?",
        "answer": "The three mandatory arguments for the visualization mode of query_db are <dataset>, which specifies the DensePose dataset from which to select the entries; <selector>, a dataset entry selector that specifies the entries to visualize; and <visualizations>, a specifier for the types of visualizations to output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some available visualizations for query_db in visualization mode?",
        "answer": "Some available visualizations for query_db in visualization mode include bbox (bounding boxes of annotated persons), dp_i (annotated points colored by containing part), dp_pts (annotated points in green), dp_segm (segmentation masks), dp_u (annotated points colored by U coordinate), and dp_v (annotated points colored by V coordinate)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the output file name template for visualizations in query_db?",
        "answer": "You can specify the output file name template for visualizations in query_db using the --output argument. The default is output.png, and the tool appends a 1-based entry index to the output file name for different dataset entries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default output file name for visualizations in query_db?",
        "answer": "The default output file name for visualizations in query_db is output.png, with a 1-based entry index appended for different dataset entries (e.g., output.0001.png, output.0002.png, etc.)."
