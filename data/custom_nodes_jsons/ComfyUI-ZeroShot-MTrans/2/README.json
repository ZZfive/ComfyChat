    {
        "question": "What are the inputs and outputs of the ComfyUI-ZeroShot-MTrans node?",
        "answer": "The inputs are: target_image (the original image for inpaint), subject_mask (the mask for inpaint), and brighter (a value to adjust the brightness of the subject). The output is an IMAGE with the subject in luminosity (grey) mode, used as input for the inpaint node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips for using the ComfyUI-ZeroShot-MTrans node?",
        "answer": "Some tips include: (1) For the output, the subject in middle grey is preferred. Adjust the brightness accordingly. (2) For the material image, it's suggested to remove all background and keep only the desired material. (3) Use IP-Adaptor strength, controlnet strength, and brighter to control the output first."
