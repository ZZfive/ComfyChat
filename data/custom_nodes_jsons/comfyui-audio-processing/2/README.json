        "question": "What does the plugin cg-noise do?",
        "answer": "cg-noise is a custom node in ComfyUI that replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."

        "question": "What are the main functionalities of the audio workshop plugin?",
        "answer": "The main functionalities of the audio workshop plugin include audio waveforms, spectrograms, filter banks, and related audio processing functionalities."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the plugin process audio data?",
        "answer": "The plugin offers various processing functionalities, including generating waveforms, detailed spectrograms, and applying filter banks to transform the audio data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the differences between complex-valued spectrograms and real-valued spectrograms?",
        "answer": "Complex-valued spectrograms contain both the magnitude and phase information of the sound waves, while real-valued spectrograms only contain the magnitude information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Griffin-Lim algorithm used for?",
        "answer": "The Griffin-Lim algorithm is used to convert a real-valued spectrogram to its corresponding audio signal."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a spectrogram be visualized?",
        "answer": "A spectrogram can be visualized through the plugin's Plot Spectrogram function, which outputs an image of the spectrogram."
