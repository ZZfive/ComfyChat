        "question": "What was added in the release for comfyui-audio-processing?",
        "answer": "In the release for comfyui-audio-processing, the following nodes were added: Load Audio From Path, Plot Waveform, Spectrogram, Inverse Spectrogram, Griffin Lim, Plot Spectrogram, Linear Filter Bank, Mel-scale Filter Bank, and Apply Filter Bank."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the \"Load Audio From Path\" node do?",
        "answer": "The \"Load Audio From Path\" node allows the user to load audio from a local path instead of an uploaded audio file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"Plot Waveform\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Plot Waveform\" node is used to plot the waveform of an `AUDIO` object."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the \"Spectrogram\" node work?",
        "answer": "The \"Spectrogram\" node computes the spectrogram of a given `AUDIO` object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the \"Inverse Spectrogram\" node do?",
        "answer": "The \"Inverse Spectrogram\" node converts a complex-valued spectrogram to `AUDIO` using the Griffin-Lim algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"Plot Spectrogram\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Plot Spectrogram\" node is used to plot the spectrogram of a `SPECT` object."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do linear and mel-scale filter banks differ?",
        "answer": "The \"Linear Filter Bank\" and \"Mel-scale Filter Bank\" nodes create different kinds of filter banks. The linear filter bank creates a uniform interval between filters, while the mel-scale filter bank creates an interval that aligns with human perception of sound."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the \"Apply Filter Bank\" node do?",
        "answer": "The \"Apply Filter Bank\" node allows the user to apply the specified filter bank to the spectrogram."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the \"Plot Filter Bank\" node?",
        "answer": "The \"Plot Filter Bank\" node is used to plot the `FILTER_BANK` object."
