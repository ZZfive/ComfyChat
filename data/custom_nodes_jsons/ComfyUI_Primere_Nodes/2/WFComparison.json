        "question": "What is the purpose of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Primere nodes for ComfyUI provide various workflows and configurations for generating images using different models and techniques, allowing users to customize their image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key differences between the Minimal, Basic, Advanced, and Full workflows in the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Minimal workflow has limited features and supports only SD and SDXL models. The Basic workflow adds support for LCM, Turbo, Cascade, Playground, and Lightning models, as well as upscaling. The Advanced workflow further includes image save and refiners, while the Full workflow incorporates all features, including the recycler, styles, networks, and custom VAE."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which sampler and model are used in the Normal SD/SDXL workflow in the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Normal SD/SDXL workflow in the Primere nodes for ComfyUI uses the euler/karras sampler with 20 steps and a CFG of 8, utilizing the Photon V1 model for SD and the batchCOREALISMXL v40 model for SDXL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the resolution of images generated using the SD model in the Basic workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the Basic workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI, the resolution of images generated using the SD model is 768."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many refiners are available in the Full workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Full workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI includes 4 refiners for enhancing image details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the average running time for generating an image using the SD model with the LCM sampler in the Basic workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the Basic workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI, the average running time for generating an image using the SD model with the LCM sampler is 3 seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which upscaler is used in the Advanced workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI, and what is the upscaled resolution for SD images?",
        "answer": "The Advanced workflow of the Primere nodes for ComfyUI uses the Ultimate SD upscaler, and the upscaled resolution for SD images is approximately 10 megapixels."
