    {
        "question": "Where can you find the custom nodes provided by ComfyUI-Prediction?",
        "answer": "All custom nodes provided by ComfyUI-Prediction are located under Add Node > sampling > prediction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the steps to set up a fully custom prediction in ComfyUI-Prediction?",
        "answer": "To set up a fully custom prediction, you need to use the Sample Predictions node as your sampler, connect the sampler input to a sampler node like KSamplerSelect, connect the sigmas input to a scheduler node like BasicScheduler, chain one or more prompts using CLIP Text Encode and Conditioned Prediction nodes, and finally connect the result to the noise_prediction input of your Sample Predictions node."
