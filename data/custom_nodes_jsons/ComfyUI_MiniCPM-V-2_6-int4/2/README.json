    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using the 'IMGCookedTextClient' extension in ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4?",
        "answer": "The 'IMGCookedTextClient' extension in ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4 provides a more efficient text completion process for the miniCPM-V-2_6 model by automatically trimming unnecessary parts of the text inputs using an LSTM-based text trimmer. This can result in faster prediction speeds and more accurate text completions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4 be used to improve prediction speed?",
        "answer": "The 'keep_model_loaded' parameter in ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4 can be set to True to improve prediction speed by keeping the model loaded in GPU memory. This eliminates the need to reload the model between prediction requests, making multiple predictions with the same model more efficient."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Python script included in the repository for ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4?",
        "answer": "The Python script included in the repository for ComfyUI_MiniCPM-V-2_6-int4 is primarily used for managing the workflow and running the miniCPM-V-2_6 model. It includes logic for handling queries and generating outputs based on the input provided."
