        "question": "What is ComfyUI_pytorch_openpose?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_pytorch_openpose is a custom node in ComfyUI that utilizes PyTorch to run OpenPose algorithm. It allows for the detection and real-time estimation of the human pose using a single webcam feed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the components involved in ComfyUI_pytorch_openpose?",
        "answer": "The main components are body_pose_model.pth and hand_pose_model.pth. These are the pre-trained models provided for detecting human body pose and hand pose respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I install ComfyUI_pytorch_openpose?",
        "answer": "To install, you need to follow the steps: 1. Clone the repository into the custom_nodes folder, and 2. Download the model files and place them in the models folder, then use the ComfyUI_pytorch_openpose under Hzzone>pytorch_openpose menu."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model files are required for installation?",
        "answer": "The required model files are body_pose_model.pth and hand_pose_model.pth, which can be downloaded from various sources provided."
