        "question": "What is the purpose of the MiDaS model?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the MiDaS model is to compute depth from a single image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many datasets was MiDaS trained on?",
        "answer": "MiDaS was trained on up to 12 datasets."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the datasets MiDaS was trained on?",
        "answer": "Some of the datasets MiDaS was trained on include ReDWeb, DIML, Movies, MegaDepth, WSVD, TartanAir, HRWSI, ApolloScape, BlendedMVS, IRS, KITTI, and NYU Depth V2."

    {
        "question": "What is the main improvement of MiDaS v3.1 over MiDaS v3.0?",
        "answer": "The main improvement of MiDaS v3.1 over MiDaS v3.0 is that the best model, BEiT_Large 512, with resolution 512x512, is on average about 28% more accurate than MiDaS v3.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the new models in MiDaS v3.1 based on?",
        "answer": "The new models in MiDaS v3.1 are based on 5 different types of transformers: BEiT, Swin2, Swin, Next-ViT, and LeViT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional arguments available for inference in MiDaS?",
        "answer": "The optional arguments available for inference in MiDaS are --height, which allows users to explore different heights, and --square, which resizes the image to a square resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the --side argument in MiDaS?",
        "answer": "The --side argument in MiDaS is optional and causes both the input RGB image and the output depth map to be shown side-by-side for comparison."
