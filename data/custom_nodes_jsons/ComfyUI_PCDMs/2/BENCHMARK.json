        "question": "What is the purpose of the benchmarks run for ComfyUI_PCDMs models?",
        "answer": "The benchmarks are run to measure the performance of various models in ComfyUI_PCDMs, such as time per operator type, FLOP per operator type, feature memory read/written per operator type, and parameter memory per operator type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models were benchmarked for ComfyUI_PCDMs?",
        "answer": "The models benchmarked for ComfyUI_PCDMs include EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, EfficientNet-B2, MixNet-M, TF MobileNet-V3 Large 1.0, MobileNet-V3 (RW), MnasNet-A1, and MnasNet-B1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the unoptimized and optimized benchmarks?",
        "answer": "The unoptimized benchmarks show the performance of the models without any optimizations applied, while the optimized benchmarks show the improved performance after applying optimizations to the models."
    },
    {
        "question": "For the EfficientNet-B0 model, what percentage of time is spent on the Conv operator in the unoptimized version?",
        "answer": "In the unoptimized version of EfficientNet-B0, 60.5145% of the time is spent on the Conv operator."
    },
    {
        "question": "How much parameter memory is used by the Conv operator in the optimized version of the MixNet-M model?",
        "answer": "In the optimized version of the MixNet-M model, the Conv operator uses 13.7059 MB of parameter memory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the total feature memory read for the unoptimized MnasNet-A1 model?",
        "answer": "The total feature memory read for the unoptimized MnasNet-A1 model is 92.5406 MB."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the optimized version of MnasNet-B1, what percentage of the total FLOP is attributed to the Conv operator?",
        "answer": "In the optimized version of MnasNet-B1, the Conv operator accounts for 99.5466% of the total FLOP."
