    {
        "question": "Can you describe the use of cg-noise in ComfyUI-RTX-Remix?",
        "answer": "cg-noise, a custom addition to ComfyUI-RTX-Remix, offers an alternative to existing noise generators (KSampler and KSampler Advanced), providing more control over noise generation through adjustable parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the implications of the addition of cg-noise in ComfyUI-RTX-Remix?",
        "answer": "The addition of cg-noise in ComfyUI-RTX-Remix has potentially improved the algorithms and models used for image and video generation by offering more options for noise variability and providing a solid alternative to its predecessors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the addition of cg-noise change how noise is generated in images?",
        "answer": "The addition of cg-noise affects the way noise is generated by providing a solution for varying noise based on seed and weight parameters, potentially leading to more controlled and distinct noise patterns within the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What details are typically covered in the 'Fixed' section of the changelog?",
        "answer": "The 'Fixed' section focuses on changes that address issues or bugs in the previous versions.
