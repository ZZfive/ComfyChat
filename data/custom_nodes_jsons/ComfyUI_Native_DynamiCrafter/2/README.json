        "question": "What is ComfyUI Native DynamiCrafter?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI Native DynamiCrafter is a custom node in ComfyUI that works natively with ComfyUI's nodes, optimizations, ControlNet, and more. It allows for dynamic crafting of images and videos using Stable Diffusion models."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I install ComfyUI Native DynamiCrafter?",
        "answer": "To install ComfyUI Native DynamiCrafter, go to your 'custom_nodes' directory in ComfyUI and run the command 'git clone https://github.com/ExponentialML/ComfyUI_Native_DynamiCrafter.git'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find the pruned UNet checkpoints for DynamiCrafter?",
        "answer": "The pruned UNet checkpoints for DynamiCrafter are available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/ExponentialML/DynamiCrafterUNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required models for using DynamiCrafter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "To use DynamiCrafter in ComfyUI, you need the DynamiCrafter models, a VAE, the CLIP model used with Stable Diffusion 2.1, and the Open CLIP Vision Model. The necessary model downloads are available at the provided HuggingFace link."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I control the speed of the generated video in DynamiCrafter?",
        "answer": "You can control the speed of the generated video in DynamiCrafter by adjusting the 'fps' parameter. For 256-based models, the highest plausible value is 4."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does DynamiCrafter support ControlNet?",
        "answer": "Yes, DynamiCrafter supports applying ControlNet to the Spatial (image) portion to guide video generations in various ways. The ControlNets are based on Stable Diffusion 2.1 and can be downloaded from the provided link."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips for using DynamiCrafter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some tips for using DynamiCrafter in ComfyUI include experimenting with different latents, choosing specific frames as init, and using interpolation with regular models. More advanced workflows and examples will be added in the future."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who developed the original DynamiCrafter?",
        "answer": "The original DynamiCrafter was developed by Doubiiu, who open-sourced the project. ComfyUI Native DynamiCrafter credits and thanks Doubiiu for their work."
