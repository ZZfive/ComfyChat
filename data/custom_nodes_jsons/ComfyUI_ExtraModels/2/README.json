    "Controlling Numerical Mods for PixArt": {
        "question": "How can the numerics of the PixArt model be controlled within the ComfyUI framework?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the numerics of the PixArt model can be controlled by adjusting the randomness of the encoding vectors used in the sampling process. This can be achieved by adjusting the 'alpha' value in the KSampler's seed function and the function blueprint for randomity control. Specifically, setting the 'alpha' parameter to a higher value between 0 and 1 increases the binary entropy, which in turn allows for a higher degree of variability in the generated image. Conversely, setting the 'alpha' parameter to a decreasing value reduces the occasional jitter effects in the densities after passing through the encoder, providing a more stable and smooth output."
