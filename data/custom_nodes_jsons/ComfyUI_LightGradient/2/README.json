        "question": "What is ComfyUI Light Gradient?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI Light Gradient is a set of nodes for creating light gradient effects in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I install ComfyUI Light Gradient?",
        "answer": "There are three ways to install ComfyUI Light Gradient: 1) Using ComfyUI Manager (recommended), 2) Cloning the GitHub repository in the ComfyUI custom_nodes directory using git, or 3) Downloading the zip file, extracting it, and copying the resulting folder to the ComfyUI custom_nodes directory. After installation, restart ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What are the nodes included in ComfyUI Light Gradient?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI Light Gradient includes two nodes: Image Gradient Node and Mask Gradient Node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs for the Image Gradient Node?",
        "answer": "The Image Gradient Node has six inputs: width (width of Mask), height (height of Mask), light_position (position of Light), multiplier (strength of Light), start_color (start color of gradient), and end_color (end color of gradient)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Gradient Node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Gradient Node is an IMAGE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs for the Mask Gradient Node?",
        "answer": "The Mask Gradient Node has four inputs: width (width of Mask), height (height of Mask), light_position (position of Light), and multiplier (strength of Light)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Mask Gradient Node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Mask Gradient Node is a Mask."
