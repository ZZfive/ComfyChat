        "question": "What features does the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin provide?",
        "answer": "The comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin provides nodes to combine prior and decoder models of Kandinsky 2.2. The features include finding priors for text and images, combining priors with weights, preparing latents only or latens based on image, and using depth hint computed by a separate node. All the weights can be found in the Kandinsky Community on HuggingFace in the Kandinsky 2.2 Collection."

    {
        "question": "How can a user prepare for the installation of the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin?",
        "answer": "Before installing the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin, a user should ensure that they have the latest version of ComfyUI and have installed all dependencies as specified in the plugin's repository. This includes the general ComfyUI and the specific dependencies such as Marigold depth estimation. Additionally, the user should download the necessary Kandinsky 2.2 checkpoints as mentioned in the installation section."

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between combining priors with weights in the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin?",
        "answer": "In the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin, combining priors with weights allows users to blend the output of different prior models. This can be particularly useful when dealing with text and image generation workflows, as it enables combining the features and characteristics of different models to produce more refined and nuanced outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of using depth hint computed by a separate node in the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin?",
        "answer": "Using a depth hint computed by a separate node in the comfyui-kandinsky22 plugin can significantly enhance the quality of the generated images, especially in depth-based workflows. The depth hint provides additional context and guidance to the model during the generation process, helping it to better understand the spatial relationships and depth information within the image, consequently leading to more realistic and detailed outputs."
