It enables upscaling before sampling to generate more detail, then stitching back the upscale image.\n4. It allows downscaling before sampling, avoiding artifacts like double heads or double bodies.\n5. It can force a specific resolution, such as 1024x1024 for SDXL models.\n6. It doesn't modify the unmasked part of the image, including the VAE encode and decode process.\n7. The nodes ensure good blending of the inpainted region."

It's particularly useful for SD models like SDXL, where you might force the size to 1024x1024.\n\nIn contrast, 'ranged_size' upscales the area as much as possible to make it fit the larger size between 'min_width', 'min_height', 'max_width', and 'max_height', with a 'padding' to align to standard sizes, then rescales before stitching back. This mode is useful when you want to ensure that the generated inpainting fits within certain boundaries."

            "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in ComfyUI-Inpaint-CropAndStitch is used to control the size of the inpainted image relative to the original image. It can be set to 'free size' or 'forced size'.\n\n'Free size' uses the 'rescale_factor' to optionally rescale the content before sampling and eventually scale back before stitching, allowing for more detailed inpainting. 'Padding' is used to align the inpainted area to a specific size, making it easier to work with in larger images.\n\n'Forced size' uses specific dimensions for 'force_width' and 'force_height' and upscales the content to these dimensions before sampling, then downscales before stitching back. This mode is useful for ensuring that the inpainting occurs specifically at the desired size."
