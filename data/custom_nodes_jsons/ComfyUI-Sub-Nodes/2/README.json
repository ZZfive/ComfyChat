        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes allows users to create subgraph nodes in ComfyUI for better organization and reusability of workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you create a subgraph in ComfyUI using ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "To create a subgraph, use 'VIV_Subgraph_Inputs' and 'VIV_Subgraph_Outputs' nodes to define the inputs and outputs respectively in a workflow. Save the workflow in a folder named 'subnodes' in the root of your ComfyUI install."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can be passed between subgraphs in ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "ANY object can be passed between subgraphs in ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes."

    {
        "question": "How can you call a subgraph in ComfyUI using ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "To call a subgraph, create a 'VIV_Subgraph' node and select your subgraph. You may need to hit the 'Refresh' button first. The inputs and outputs will be populated automatically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to progress bars and previews in a subgraph when using ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "Any progress bars and previews in the subgraph will show on the subgraph node, but any image previews will not."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be noted about previously saved workflows when using ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes?",
        "answer": "Previously saved workflows will not work as subgraphs because this package adds extra keys to the normal save output to facilitate running the subgraph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the current state of the ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes project?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-Sub-Nodes project is still very young and there are likely a good amount of bugs to be found. More quality of life improvements will be added as the developer has time and sanity to implement them."
