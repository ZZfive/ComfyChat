        "question": "What is ComfyUI-N-Suite?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-N-Suite is a suite of custom nodes for ComfyUI that includes Integer, string and float variable nodes, GPT nodes and video nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported operating systems for ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-N-Nodes have been primarily tested on Windows in the default environment provided by ComfyUI and in the environment created by the notebook for paperspace specifically with the cyberes/gradient-base-py3.10:latest docker image. Any other environment has not been tested."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I load a video file and extract frames from it using ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "You can use the LoadVideoAdvanced node in ComfyUI-N-Nodes to load a video file and extract frames from it. The node allows you to set various parameters such as framerate, resizing options, frame limit, batch size, starting frame, and autoplay."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaveVideo node in ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "The SaveVideo node in ComfyUI-N-Nodes takes extracted frames and metadata as input and can save them as a new video file and/or individual frame images. Video compression and frame PNG compression can be configured using this node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I interpolate between extracted video frames to increase the frame rate using ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "You can use the FrameInterpolator node in ComfyUI-N-Nodes to interpolate between extracted video frames and increase the frame rate. The node uses the RIFE interpolation model to generate additional in-between frames at a higher frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different types of variable nodes available in ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-N-Nodes provides three types of variable nodes: Integer, Float, and String. These nodes are designed to bypass limitations in links and allow for more flexible connections between nodes in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which GPT models are supported by the GPTLoaderSimple and GPTSampler nodes in ComfyUI-N-Nodes?",
        "answer": "The GPTLoaderSimple and GPTSampler nodes in ComfyUI-N-Nodes support four different models: GGUF models supported by llama.cpp, Llava, Moondream, and Joytag."
