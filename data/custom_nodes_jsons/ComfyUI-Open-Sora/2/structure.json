    {
        "question": "Which file should be modified to change the sampling prompts for inference in Open-Sora?",
        "answer": "To change the sampling prompts for inference, the '.txt' file passed to the '--prompt_path' argument should be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'model' dictionary in the inference config file?",
        "answer": "The 'model' dictionary in the inference config file defines the model type, space and time positional encoding scales, and other optional settings like enabling flash attention and fused kernel for speeding up training and inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'text_encoder' dictionary in the inference config file?",
        "answer": "The 'text_encoder' dictionary in the inference config file specifies the type of text encoder (t5 or clip), the path to the pretrained text encoder, and the maximum length of input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the batch size for training be set in the training config file?",
        "answer": "The batch size for training can be set using the 'batch_size' variable in the training config file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'root' variable in the training config file?",
        "answer": "The 'root' variable in the training config file specifies the root path to the dataset used for training."
