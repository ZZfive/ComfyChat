    {
        "question": "How does the ScramblePrompts [m9] node modify prompts in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScramblePrompts [m9] node modifies prompts in ComfyUI by changing the order of prompts, removing prompts, and changing the weight of prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the order_prompts_percent field in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node control?",
        "answer": "The order_prompts_percent field in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node controls the percent of prompts to reorder."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can prompts be kept from being removed in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node?",
        "answer": "To keep prompts from being removed in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node, you can use the keep_prompts field to specify a comma-delimited list of keywords. Prompts that include the specified keyword will not be removed."

    {
        "question": "What does the max_weight field in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node control?",
        "answer": "The max_weight field in the ScramblePrompts [m9] node sets the maximum final weight. If a change would take the weight over the max, the change is not made."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you ensure that the ScramblePrompts [m9] node generates different results for each image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "To ensure that the ScramblePrompts [m9] node generates different results for each image in ComfyUI, you can add a seed primitive and connect it to the seed_optional input. This will cause the node to be reevaluated for each run, resulting in a different result for each image."
