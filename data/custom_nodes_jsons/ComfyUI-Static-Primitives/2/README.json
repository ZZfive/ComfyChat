        "question": "How can you install ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "To install ComfyUI-Static-Primitives, you need to clone the repo inside your custom_nodes folder using the command: `git clone https://github.com/80sVectorz/ComfyUI-Static-Primitives.git`"
    },

        "question": "What new node category is added by ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Static-Primitives adds a new node category called 'primitives'."

        "question": "Which basic data-types are covered by the primitives in ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Static-Primitives includes a primitive for all the basic data-types."

    {
        "question": "What is the collection type system in ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "The collection type system in ComfyUI-Static-Primitives allows users to add custom collection types. By default, it includes samplers and schedulers."

    {
        "question": "How can users add their own collection primitives in ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "Users can find information on how to add their own collection primitives in ComfyUI-Static-Primitives by referring to the file located at https://github.com/80sVectorz/ComfyUI-Static-Primitives/blob/main/collection_primitives/collection_primitives_readme.md."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why were static primitives created for ComfyUI-Static-Primitives?",
        "answer": "Static primitives were created for ComfyUI-Static-Primitives because reroutes don't work with dynamic primitives. Static primitives have a predefined type and can work with reroutes, helping to simplify the user interface and avoid wire spaghetti."
