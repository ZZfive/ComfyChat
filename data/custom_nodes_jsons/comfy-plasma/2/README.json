        "question": "What is comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "comfy-plasma is a simple plasma noise generator extension for ComfyUI that can generate various types of noise patterns for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of noise can comfy-plasma generate?",
        "answer": "comfy-plasma can generate plasma noise, random noise, greyscale noise, pink noise, brown noise and plasma KSampler noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Turbulence' parameter affect the plasma noise generated by comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "The 'Turbulence' parameter in comfy-plasma scales the noise clouds in the plasma noise. Lower values result in smoother, larger clouds, while higher values result in more static-like noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Seed' parameter control in the plasma noise node of comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "The 'Seed' parameter in the plasma noise node of comfy-plasma replicates a specific noise seed on every execution. It can be set to fixed, increment, decrement or randomize."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'Default' and 'Rand' distribution types in the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "In the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma, the 'Default' distribution type uses torch.randn() which is a Gaussian distributed noise algorithm, while 'Rand' uses torch.rand() which is a truly random noise algorithm that doesn't stick to a single random distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Latent Noise' parameter affect the output in the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "The 'Latent Noise' parameter in the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma controls the strength of the built-in noise. A value of 0 means no noise is used, and a value of 1 means it's adding all the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Denoise' parameter do in the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma?",
        "answer": "The 'Denoise' parameter in the Plasma KSampler node of comfy-plasma controls how much the image should be blurred to allow the model to interpret the noise/image with noise. Higher values at high resolutions can induce faces within faces, while lower values will look closer to the input image/noise but prevent faces within faces."
