        "question": "What is the purpose of the vlmevalkit directory?",
        "answer": "The vlmevalkit directory contains the necessary files and scripts to evaluate the MiniCPM-V models, such as installing dependencies and running inference on different datasets."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three model options available in vlmeval/config.py?",
        "answer": "The three model options available in vlmeval/config.py are 'MiniCPM-V', 'MiniCPM-V-2', and 'MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you evaluate multiple datasets simultaneously using the run_inference.sh script?",
        "answer": "To evaluate multiple datasets simultaneously, you need to pass the dataset names separated by spaces and enclosed in quotes, such as '$DATALIST=\"POPE ScienceQA_TEST ChartQA_TEST\"'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between setting MODE=all and MODE=infer when running the run_inference.sh script?",
        "answer": "Setting MODE=all will directly score each benchmark, while setting MODE=infer will only generate the inference results without scoring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the vqaeval directory?",
        "answer": "The vqaeval directory contains the necessary files and scripts to evaluate MiniCPM-V models on visual question answering datasets, such as TextVQA and DocVQA."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main parameters that can be passed to the run_inference.sh script in the vqaeval directory?",
        "answer": "The main parameters include specifying the paths for TextVQA and DocVQA evaluation images and questions, deciding which tasks to evaluate, setting the model name and path, and specifying the output path for saving the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional step is required for evaluating the DocVQATest task?",
        "answer": "For evaluating the DocVQATest task, you need to run the run_transform.sh script to convert the inference results into the required format for uploading to the official website."
