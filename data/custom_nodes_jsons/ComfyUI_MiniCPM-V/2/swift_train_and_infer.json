        "question": "How can the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model be used for inference through SWIFT in Python code?",
        "answer": "In Python code, the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model can be used for inference through SWIFT by importing necessary modules, setting the model type, obtaining the template type, loading the model, constructing the template, and then performing inference with the model, template, query, and images."

    {
        "question": "What format should the training data be in for SWIFT?",
        "answer": "The training data for SWIFT should be in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object with fields for query, response, history (optional), and images."
