        "question": "How does MiniCPM-V 2.6 achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-image understanding?",
        "answer": "MiniCPM-V 2.6 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-image understanding by leveraging multi-image pipeline, which utilizes the feature of MiniCPM-V 3B-LLAM3 to reason over multiple images. This pipeline first shuffles and mixes multiple input images in the fixed order and then generates a large context that combines the features of all input images. MiniCPM-V 2.5, inspired by our recently developed [IMae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13469) that supported image summary tasks, conducts multi-image generation and reasoning based on this pipeline."
