        "question": "What does the Simple Google Translator do?",
        "answer": "The Simple Google Translator is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows users to input text in any language and have it automatically translated. This is useful for users who need quick translations in their workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Simple Google Translator work?",
        "answer": "The Simple Google Translator takes a text input that is to be translated and returns the translated version. Its effectiveness relies on the quality of the existing linguistic model that powers google translator, which isn't perfect but usually provides sufficient translation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Simple Resolution Solver?",
        "answer": "The Simple Resolution Solver is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to assist users in determining the optimal resolution for their models. It aims to reduce the need for manual calculation of width and height that can be computationally intensive."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Simple Resolution Solver help save time?",
        "answer": "The Simple Resolution Solver eliminates the time-consuming process of manually calculating resolution values for different models, thus streamlining the workflow and reducing stress on the user."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of applications does the Simple Resolution Solver cater to?",
        "answer": "The Simple Resolution Solver caters to applications where large-scale computation of mode resolution is needed, such as machine learning projects, image processing, and media encryption techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there any relation between the two nodes: Google Translator and Resolution Solver?",
        "answer": "Both the Google Translator and the Resolution Solver, as custom nodes in ComfyUI, enhance the user's workflow by streamlining activities. The Google Translator deals with language translation, whereas the Resolution Solver addresses resolution calculation."
