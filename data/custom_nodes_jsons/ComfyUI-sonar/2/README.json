        "question": "What is ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-sonar is a janky implementation of Sonar sampling (momentum-based sampling) for ComfyUI, along with an assortment of advanced noise tools."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of momentum based sampling does ComfyUI-sonar support?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-sonar currently supports Euler, Euler Ancestral, and DPM++ SDE sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended way to use ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The most flexible way to use ComfyUI-sonar is with a custom sampler, and the ancestral version is personally recommended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SamplerSonarEuler node in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The SamplerSonarEuler node is a custom sampler node in ComfyUI-sonar that combines Euler sampling and momentum and optionally guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the SamplerSonarEuler and SamplerSonarEulerAncestral nodes in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The SamplerSonarEulerAncestral node is the ancestral version of the SamplerSonarEuler node, with the same features but using ancestral Euler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SonarGuidanceConfig node in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The SonarGuidanceConfig node can be optionally plugged into the Sonar sampler nodes to provide guidance configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended range for the guidance_factor when using the 'linear' guidance type in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "For the 'linear' guidance type in ComfyUI-sonar, reasonable values for the guidance_factor are more like 0.001 to 0.02."
