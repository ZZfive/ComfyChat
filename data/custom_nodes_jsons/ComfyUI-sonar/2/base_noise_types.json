        "question": "What is the default noise type for SDE samplers in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The default noise type for SDE samplers in ComfyUI-sonar is Brownian."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default noise type for non-SDE samplers in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The default noise type for non-SDE samplers in ComfyUI-sonar is Gaussian."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Green Test noise type in ComfyUI-sonar affect the generated images?",
        "answer": "The Green Test noise type in ComfyUI-sonar produces a very colorful effect on the generated images, but it's very strong and not really suitable for initial generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What variations of the Highres Pyramid noise type are showcased in the ComfyUI-sonar examples?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-sonar examples showcase three variations of the Highres Pyramid noise type: default, area scaling, and bislerp scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Pyramid Mix noise type in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The Pyramid Mix noise type in ComfyUI-sonar is a combination of positive and negative pyramid noise. The effect on the generation is mild compared to raw pyramid noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Pyramid Old noise type in ComfyUI-sonar differ from other pyramid noise types?",
        "answer": "The Pyramid Old noise type in ComfyUI-sonar may not actually be pyramid noise at all. Additionally, it is quite slow to generate as it effectively generates noise ~60x the latent size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Rainbow noise type in ComfyUI-sonar?",
        "answer": "The Rainbow noise type in ComfyUI-sonar is a mix of Perlin and Green noise types. It has two variations: mild, which uses a relatively low proportion of green noise, and intense, which uses a higher proportion of green noise for a more extreme effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the noise types in ComfyUI-sonar be used to generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "The noise types in ComfyUI-sonar can be used to generate variations in images by scheduling the noise type to kick in at a certain percentage and/or mixing it with other noise types."
