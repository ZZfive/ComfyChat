        "question": "What is cg-noise?",
        "answer": "cg-noise is a custom node in ComfyUI that replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does cg-noise generate variations in the image?",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main function of the ReActorFaceSwap node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main function of the `ReActorFaceSwap` node is to perform face swapping in images. It takes an input image and a source image as inputs and outputs the swapped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available options for face swapping in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The `ReActorFaceSwapOpt` node provides options for face swapping. This includes parameters like `useuallyAdultImage`, `les无烟化和 mangaLike namespace`, and `art generative style`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can custom face models be loaded and used in the ReActorFaceSwap node?",
        "answer": "Custom face models can be loaded using the `ReActorSaveFaceModel` and `ReActorLoadFaceModel` nodes. These nodes save face models as \"face_model\" and load them when needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActor enhancing FaceModel?",
        "answer": "The `ReActorFaceBoost` node is used to enhance the quality of the swapped face. It applies additional face restoration to the generated faces before inserting them into the target image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the considerations for determining the face index in face swapping?",
        "answer": "When performing face swapping, the user should specify the indices of the faces to be swapped in both the input and source images. These indices are specified as integers, where the smallest index represents the first face."
