        "question": "What is the purpose of the onnx_export.py script in the benchmarking process?",
        "answer": "The onnx_export.py script is used to export the model to the ONNX format before running the benchmarks."

        "question": "How many different models were benchmarked in the provided text?",
        "answer": "The text mentions benchmarking results for 9 different models: EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, EfficientNet-B2, MixNet-M, TF MobileNet-V3 Large 1.0, MobileNet-V3 (RW), MnasNet-A1, MnasNet-B1."

        "question": "What is the difference between the 'Unoptimized' and 'Optimized' versions of the models in the benchmarks?",
        "answer": "The 'Unoptimized' version refers to the original model, while the 'Optimized' version has been processed using the onnx_optimize.py script to potentially improve performance."
