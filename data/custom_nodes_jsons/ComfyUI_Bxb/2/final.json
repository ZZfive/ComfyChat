Discontinued inner network penetration and using brand new communication logic to solve various network connection error issues caused by firewall filtering, including 360 repostfailling problems.\n2. Increased workflow security and eliminated workflow exposure: workflow API data is stored locally on the computer and is no longer uploaded to the server. A dedicated image storage node, sdBxb_saveImage (default image storage node of ComfyUI) does not store workflow information.\n3. Supported Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.\n4. Resolved the conflict issues between sdBxb and some plugins.\n5. Optimized multi-computer concurrent logic and support for multiple computers concurrently whenever the model path information is consistent and sharing the workflows API data saved in the ComfyUI_Bxb plugin installed on new computers, new computers start up and open the comfyui terminal without the need to click the conversion again. In cloud computers, simply clone the computer's startup and multi-computer concurrent support can be achieved.\n6. Added user item deletion and sharing function."
