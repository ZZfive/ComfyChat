        "question": "How can the冲锋体现在用于执行 _ unfamiliar action_ commanded on the ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI uses its Luma API to fulfill the commands given in the unfamiliar action. Users can use the 'image_generation.json' file in the workflow to start image2video generation. After completion, the video files are saved in the 'output/luma video' directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the installation steps for comfyui_lumaAPI?",
        "answer": "To install comfyui_lumaAPI, users should first 'cd' into the 'custom_nodes' directory. From there, clone the repository from GitHub using 'git clone https://github.com/superyoman/comfyui_lumaAPI.git'. If dependencies have not been installed by default, pip can be used to install them by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Lastly, restarting ComfyUI is required after installation."

    {
        "question": "What does the 'check_result.json' file do?",
        "answer": "The 'check_result.json' file is used to retrieve the video link generated by the Luma generation process. It checks if Luma generation has finished and automatically downloads the video if the 'download' option is set to true. The video will be saved in the 'output/luma video' folder."

    {
        "question": "How does the comfyui_lumaAPI interact with Luma application?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI utilizes the Luma API to carry out the actions specified in the unfamiliar action. Users can perform Luma image2video generation using the 'image_generation.json' file in their workflow. Upon completion, the resulting video is automatically downloaded and saved in the 'output/luma video' folder if the 'download' option is set to true, and the video link can be obtained using the 'check_result.json' file."

        "question": "What is the main difference between using the predicted xy coordinates to constrain the size of the bird in the comfyui_lumaAPI?",
        "answer": "The main difference in using the predicted xy coordinates to constrain the size of the bird is that such prediction utilizes the information derived from the abnormal action. It is a technique to account for the possible uncertainties introduced by the unfamiliar action and aims to improve the image generation accuracy."

    {
        "question": "What languages are supported by the comfyui_lumaAPI?",
        "answer": "The comfyui_lumaAPI supports multiple programming languages for customization and integration, although the specific ones are not mentioned in the document. Users can build custom nodes or plug-ins to extend the functionality of ComfyUI in languages they prefer."
