        "question": "What is the purpose of the main node in Vector_Sculptor_ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The main node in Vector_Sculptor_ComfyUI makes the conditioning go towards similar concepts to enrich the composition or further away to make it more precise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the main node determine when to stop gathering similar pre-condition vectors?",
        "answer": "The main node gathers similar pre-condition vectors for as long as the cosine similarity score diminishes. If it climbs back up, it stops."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three sculptor methods available in the Vector sculptor text encode node?",
        "answer": "The three sculptor methods available in the Vector sculptor text encode node are: forward, backward, and maximum_absolute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Sculptor Intensity' parameter control in the Vector sculptor text encode node?",
        "answer": "The 'Sculptor Intensity' parameter controls how strong the effect of the Vector sculptor text encode node will be. For photorealistic images, values between 0 and 1 are recommended, while for more artistic purposes, values between 1 and 2 are suggested."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the token normalization options available in the Vector sculptor text encode node?",
        "answer": "The token normalization options in the Vector sculptor text encode node include: none, mean, set at 1, and mean of all tokens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between 'Conditioning (Slerp)' and 'Conditioning (Average keep magnitude)' nodes?",
        "answer": "'Conditioning (Slerp)' performs an actual spherical linear interpolation (slerp) between conditionings, while 'Conditioning (Average keep magnitude)' does a weighted average with the conditionings and their magnitudes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Conditioning normalize magnitude to empty' node do?",
        "answer": "The 'Conditioning normalize magnitude to empty' node makes the overall intensity of the conditioning equal to that of an empty conditioning. It can lead to more balanced images in terms of colors and contrasts but may also result in more molten people."
