            "question": "Can you explain what the non-uniform deblurring process does?",
            "answer": "The non-uniform deblurring process is implemented with the `python non_uniform_deblurring.py` command and is used for images with variations."

            "question": "How does the inpainting process restore missing parts of images? What command should be used?",
            "answer": "For inpainting, the command is `python inpainting.py`. It restores missing details in the images."

        {
            "question": "What does the super-resolution process achieve and how is it executed?",
            "answer": "The super-resolution process, run with `python super_resolution.py`, increases the resolution of low-resolution images."
