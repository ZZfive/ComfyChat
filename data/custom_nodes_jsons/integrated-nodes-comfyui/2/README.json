        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Double Prompt' integrated node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the 'Double Prompt' integrated node in ComfyUI is to combine two CLIP encoding prompts in a single node, which is equivalent to the workflow of having two identical nodes titled CLIP Text Encode (Prompt) connected to an Apply ControlNet (Advanced) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'control_after_generate' widget used in the 'txt2img' integrated node?",
        "answer": "In the 'txt2img' integrated node, the 'control_after_generate' widget is used to control whether to apply post-processing steps after image generation. If it is set to 'Yes', post-processing steps are applied to the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'ComfyUI-Manager' extension used for?",
        "answer": "The 'ComfyUI-Manager' extension is used for managing ComfyUI from a single integrated node, where you can set properties and rearrange nodes or custom nodes without going into each node individually."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Inpaint' integrated node do?",
        "answer": "The 'Inpaint' integrated node is a complete image-to-image workflow in a single node that works with node templates. It converts an image into another using input source images, mask, and additional prompt text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Inpaint not Masked' integrated node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'Inpaint not Masked' integrated node is similar to the 'Inpaint' node but inverses the image mask, so that the non-masked areas are inpainted, allowing for different effects based on the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'Double Prompt' and 'ControlNet with Prompts' integrated nodes?",
        "answer": "The 'Double Prompt' integrated node combines two CLIP encoding prompts in a single node, while the 'ControlNet with Prompts' node combines an Apply ControlNet node with two text prompts and an image loader."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ' control_after_generate', 'steps', and 'cfg' widgets in the 'txt2img' integrated node?",
        "answer": "The ' control_after_generate', 'steps', and 'cfg' widgets in the 'txt2img' integrated node are used to control additional properties of the text-to-image conversion process. ' control_after_generate' determines if post-generation control is applied, 'steps' controls the number of generated images (together with ' cfg'), and 'cfg' specifies additional parameters for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'export_outputs' property in the integrated nodes configuration?",
        "answer": "The 'export_outputs' property in the integrated nodes configuration is used to specify which outputs should be included in the integrated node. It allows explicitly controlling which outputs are visible and usable by users interacting with the integrated node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is an integrated node different from the existing nodes in a ComfyUI workflow?",
        "answer": "An integrated node in ComfyUI is a special node that includes multiple existing nodes, combines their structures, and allows managing and configuring them from a single integrated node. It hides the inner structure, simplifies operations, and enhances reusability, making it easier to reuse and quickly configure complex workflows."
