        "question": "What is PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PuLID ComfyUI is a native implementation of the PuLID model in ComfyUI, which allows users to generate images using a 4-step lighting UNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'method' parameter in PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in PuLID ComfyUI applies weights in different ways. 'Fidelity' is closer to the reference ID, while 'Style' leaves more freedom to the checkpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of the quality of the reference image in PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The quality of the reference image is very important in PuLID ComfyUI. A clean and sharp picture is recommended for better results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'neutral' method and other methods in PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'neutral' method in PuLID ComfyUI does not perform any normalization. When using this option with the standard Apply node, users should lower the weight."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the installation requirements for PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "To install PuLID ComfyUI, users need the PuLID pre-trained model, EVA CLIP (EVA02-CLIP-L-14-336), facexlib dependency, and InsightFace with AntelopeV2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Advanced node in PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Advanced node in PuLID ComfyUI has a 'fidelity' slider and a 'projection' option. Lower 'fidelity' values grant higher resemblance to the reference image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between 'ortho_v2' and 'ortho' projection options in the Advanced node of PuLID ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "'ortho_v2' with 'fidelity: 8' in the Advanced node of PuLID ComfyUI is the same as the 'fidelity' method in the standard node, while 'ortho' with 'fidelity: 16' is the same as the 'style' method."
