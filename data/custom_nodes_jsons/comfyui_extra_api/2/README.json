        "question": "What is the purpose of the `Checkpoints` endpoint?",
        "answer": "The `Checkpoints` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/checkpoints`, is used to retrieve all the checkpoints available in the ComfyUI system. Checkpoints are often used to save the state of a model, allowing for consistent results when the model is reloaded with the same checkpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `RefreshCheckpoints` endpoint work?",
        "answer": "The `RefreshCheckpoints` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/refresh-checkpoints`, is used to update the list of checkpoints in the ComfyUI system. When this endpoint is called with a `POST` method, the server will re-evaluate and refresh the list of checkpoints, ensuring that the information available is up-to-date and reflects any changes that may have occurred in the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information is provided by the `Loras` endpoint?",
        "answer": "The `Loras` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/loras`, provides access to all the LoRa configurations within the ComfyUI system. LoRa, short for LoRaWAN Industrial Internet protocol, is a wireless communication protocol designed for industrial IoT applications. This endpoint allows users to view and manage all the LoRa configurations, including their settings, parameters, and status."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the `RefreshLoras` endpoint be used?",
        "answer": "The `RefreshLoras` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/refresh-loras`, is used to update the list of LoRa configurations in the ComfyUI system. Similar to the `RefreshCheckpoints` endpoint, this endpoint is designed to be called with a `POST` method, prompting the server to refresh and update the list of LoRa configurations. This ensures that the information available is current and reflects any modifications or updates made to the LoRa configurations within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `OutputImages` endpoint?",
        "answer": "The `OutputImages` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/output-images`, is used to list all the output images generated by the `PreviewImage` node in the ComfyUI system. This endpoint can be queried by providing a boolean parameter `temp`, which when set to `true`, will only list the temporary output images that were generated in the `PreviewImage` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the `DeleteOutputImage` endpoint be used?",
        "answer": "The `DeleteOutputImage` endpoint, located at `/comfyapi/v1/output-images/{filename}`, is used to delete a specific output image from the ComfyUI system. This endpoint requires a `DELETE` method to be called and accepts a query parameter `temp`, which when set to `true`, will only delete the temporary output image that was generated in the `PreviewImage` node. The `filename` parameter identifies the specific output image to be deleted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should the `OutputImages` endpoint query be constructed when retrieving all output images?",
        "answer": "To retrieve all output images from the `OutputImages` endpoint, the query should be constructed without any additional parameters. This means that the default behavior of the endpoint, which is to list all output images, will be applied. If there is a need to filter out temporary images, setting the `temp` query parameter to `false` would be required."
