        "question": "What is the purpose of the Rerange Sigmas node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools?",
        "answer": "The Rerange Sigmas node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools takes input sigmas and produces a new set of sigmas with the same sigma_max and sigma_min, but reranged to a given number of steps. This allows for easily changing the amount of steps given to a single sampling node without requiring multiple changes or marking a part of a workflow as stale."

    {
        "question": "How does the Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools work?",
        "answer": "The Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools uses a Gaussian blur to approximately split a noised latent into noise and un-noised parts, and then 'splices' the denoised portion of the lower latent with the residual noise from the upper latent. This changes low frequency detail while preserving higher level detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some potential applications of the Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools?",
        "answer": "The Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools can be used to change features like hair color while preserving the fine detail of hair strands. It is particularly useful with renoise (flip sigmas) workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Splice Denoised node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools?",
        "answer": "The Splice Denoised node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools allows for a more accurate reproduction of Splice Latents when both output and denoised output exist (sampler custom). Unlike Splice Latents, it does not strip the higher frequency detail of the donor_latent."

    {
        "question": "What does the Temporal Splice node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools do?",
        "answer": "The Temporal Splice node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools performs a splice across the temporal domain, combining the detail which does not move from the lower latent with the detail that does move the upper latent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some use cases for the Temporal Splice node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools?",
        "answer": "The Temporal Splice node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools was primarily implemented to experiment with the coloring of line art animations, but has also seen use in filtering graphical artifacts introduced by AnimateDiff in rotoscoping workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the limitations or issues currently being investigated with the Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools?",
        "answer": "The Splice Latents node in ComfyUI-SpliceTools produces novel results, but seems to introduce haloing artifacts, which are still being investigated. These artifacts are likely a result of how the frequency filtering is implemented."
