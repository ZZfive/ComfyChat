        "question": "What is RAVE?",
        "answer": "RAVE is a video generation model that can generate videos based on text prompts. It is implemented in ComfyUI through the ComfyUI-RAVE extension."

        "question": "What is used for noise inversion in ComfyUI-RAVE?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE uses BlenderNeko's Unsampler for noise inversion, which is a custom node in ComfyUI."

        "question": "Is there a basic workflow included in ComfyUI-RAVE?",
        "answer": "Yes, ComfyUI-RAVE includes a basic workflow using the cupcake train example from the RAVE paper."

    {
        "question": "Which stable diffusion model was used for most of the testing in ComfyUI-RAVE?",
        "answer": "Most of the testing in ComfyUI-RAVE was done using the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does ComfyUI-RAVE work with the Stable Diffusion XL model?",
        "answer": "Yes, ComfyUI-RAVE does work with the Stable Diffusion XL model, although not as well as with the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, possibly because the multi-resolution training reduces the tiling effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What might be the reason for ComfyUI-RAVE not working as well with the Stable Diffusion XL model?",
        "answer": "The reason ComfyUI-RAVE might not work as well with the Stable Diffusion XL model could be due to the multi-resolution training reducing the tiling effect."
