    {
        "question": "How do the font sizes impact the output of the custom node?",
        "answer": "The font sizes in the custom node can impact the output in a few ways. Firstly, the node supports multiple font sizes, but there is some overlap between the sizes. This effect can be improved by adjusting the aspect ratio. Secondly, the ASCIIARTNode versions 1 and 2 use random font sizes to avoid duplication. Lastly, the ASCIIArtSinglefontNode uses a single font size."

    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs and outputs of the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node?",
        "answer": "The comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node requires the 'image' as an input and produces an 'Image' as an output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the output image of the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node be adjusted?",
        "answer": "The output image of the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node can be adjusted by modifying several parameters. These parameters include 'pixel size', 'font size', 'aspect ratio correction', 'font name', 'ascii characters filename', 'brightness', and 'contrast'. Each parameter adjusts a specific aspect of the ASCII art, such as size, visual appearance, or brightness."

    {
        "question": "Which specific font file is used by default by the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node?",
        "answer": "The default font file used by the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node is Chewy-Regular.ttf."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'aspect_ratio_correction' parameter in the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node?",
        "answer": "The 'aspect_ratio_correction' parameter in the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node is used to adjust the output when there is noticeable character overlap. Increasing the value of this parameter helps in improving the layout by either increasing or decreasing the aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'brightness' parameter in the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node do?",
        "answer": "The 'brightness' parameter in the comfyui-color-ascii-art-node custom node adjusts the overall brightness of the resulting ASCII art image. By default, the brightness is set to 1.0."
