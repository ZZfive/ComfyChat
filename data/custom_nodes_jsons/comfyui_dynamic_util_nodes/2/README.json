        "question": "What are dynamic util nodes in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Dynamic util nodes in ComfyUI are specialized nodes designed to assist in managing the workflow and enhancing the environment by providing utility functions and dynamic parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What tasks can be accomplished with dynamic util nodes?",
        "answer": "Dynamic util nodes can perform tasks such as managing specific parameter values in the environment, setting a consistent quality level for all renders, reducing memory consumption during training, and maintaining multiple GPUs and print levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are dynamic util nodes applied in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Dynamic util nodes are applied in ComfyUI by defining parameters for specific Karl nodes, enabling automatic script generation for specific serial nodes, and ensuring that weight-binding assigns vsync correctly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters can be set via the dynamic util nodes?",
        "answer": "The parameters that can be set via dynamic util nodes include models, subfolders, params for weights, triggers, delimiters, whether to use only active architectures, what architecture to use first, whether to restore custom nodes, what to restore custom nodes from, and additional flags for custom nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do dynamic util nodes help with JSON loading?",
        "answer": "Dynamic util nodes are used in JSON loading by setting the `json_file` parameter for `KarlFolder` and `KarlCommands` nodes, and this allows for loading JSON files more seamlessly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the implications of setting 'restore_custom_node' and 'custom_node_removed' in dynamic util nodes?",
        "answer": "Setting 'restore_custom_node' and 'custom_node_removed' in dynamic util nodes can help avoid issues where custom nodes are not removed from the manager after installation, preventing manual node removals until the loader is fixed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the purpose of 'add_custom_nodes' and 'use_legacy_input' in dynamic util nodes.",
        "answer": "The 'add_custom_nodes' parameter in dynamic util nodes is used to add custom nodes to the environment, while 'use_legacy_input' is used to enable backwards-compatibility for environmental customization work by allowing nodes to be dynamically assigned as post-processing for processing legacy input."
