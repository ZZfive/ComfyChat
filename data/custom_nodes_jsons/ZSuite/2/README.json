        "question": "What is the purpose of the Prompter node in ZSuite?",
        "answer": "The Prompter node in ZSuite uses files to randomize pre-defined sorted subjects of random things, allowing users to customize prompts based on their wishes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the RF Node in ZSuite and what does it utilize for randomization?",
        "answer": "The RF Node in ZSuite is a prototype node that utilizes RF ambient noise for robust randomization, enhancing the capabilities of the randomizer provider."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RF Node in ZSuite capture and process data?",
        "answer": "The RF Node captures data at a rate of 4096 bytes per cycle and processes it using the numpy library for normalization, ensuring the data is in a workable format."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is a server setup necessary for the RF Node in ZSuite?",
        "answer": "A server setup is necessary because the RTL-SDR device communicates via TCP/IP, and the server acts as an intermediary, allowing ZSuite to access the data stream from the RTL-SDR device."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the configurable settings for the RF Node in ZSuite?",
        "answer": "Users can customize default device parameters such as frequency, gain values, and samplerates by editing the ZS_Rtlsdr.py file located in the ZSuite directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the frequency range of the RTL-SDR device used in the RF Node?",
        "answer": "The frequency range of the RTL-SDR device used in the RF Node is typically between 5KHz and 1.7GHz."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do gain values impact the performance of the RTL-SDR device in the RF Node?",
        "answer": "Higher gain values may improve weak signal reception but can introduce noise, while auto (default) adjusts gain automatically to balance the signal quality."
