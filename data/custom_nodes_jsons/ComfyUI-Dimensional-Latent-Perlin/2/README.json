        "question": "What is Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "Dimensional Latent Perlin is a custom node for ComfyUI that generates Perlin noise in the latent space. It is designed to work seamlessly with various diffusion models and can be used as an alternative or complement to standard random noise generators in image generation pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the features of Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "The features of Dimensional Latent Perlin include generating Perlin noise that matches the latent space of diffusion models, adjustable parameters for fine-tuning the noise generation, compatibility with different model architectures and latent space dimensions, the ability to adapt to existing latent images or model specifications, and support for batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can Dimensional Latent Perlin be installed?",
        "answer": "Dimensional Latent Perlin can be installed by cloning the repository into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory via ComfyUI Manager or by using the command: git clone https://github.com/neuralsamurai/ComfyUI-Dimensional-Latent-Perlin.git. After installation, restart ComfyUI or reload custom nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input parameters for Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "The input parameters for Dimensional Latent Perlin include seed (for reproducibility), width and height of the output image, batch size (number of images to generate in a batch), detail level (controls the level of detail in the Perlin noise), and downsample factor (downsampling factor for the latent space)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for Dimensional Latent Perlin include latent_image (an existing latent image to match dimensions) and model (a diffusion model to match latent space specifications)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "The output of Dimensional Latent Perlin is a latent representation of the generated Perlin noise, denoted as LATENT."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who inspired and originally authored Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "Dimensional Latent Perlin was inspired by and based on the work of Extraltodeus, the original author."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the license for Dimensional Latent Perlin?",
        "answer": "Dimensional Latent Perlin is licensed under the MIT License."
