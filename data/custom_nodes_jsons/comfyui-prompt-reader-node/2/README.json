    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Parameter Generator Node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Parameter Generator Node in ComfyUI is used to generate parameters and output them simultaneously to the Prompt Saver Node and KSampler Node, as it's not possible to directly extract metadata from KSampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Batch Loader Node work in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Loader Node in ComfyUI is designed for the Prompt Reader Node to batch-read image files in a directory. It cannot be used with other custom nodes. For batch processing, the 'IMAGE' output of the Batch Loader Node should be connected to the 'image' input of the Prompt Reader Node."
