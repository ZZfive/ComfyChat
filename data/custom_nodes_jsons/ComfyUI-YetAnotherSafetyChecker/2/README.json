        "answer": "The image output of ComfyUI-YetAnotherSafetyChecker will output black unless the input falls below the selected threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the string output in ComfyUI-YetAnotherSafetyChecker?",
        "answer": "The string output in ComfyUI-YetAnotherSafetyChecker outputs the score given to the image, intended to be used with a show text node to adjust the threshold setting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CUDA toggle in ComfyUI-YetAnotherSafetyChecker do?",
        "answer": "The CUDA toggle in ComfyUI-YetAnotherSafetyChecker allows the model to be loaded on the GPU for faster processing."
