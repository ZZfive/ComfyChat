        "question": "What is the purpose of the `ComfyUI-StableAudioSampler` extension?",
        "answer": "The `ComfyUI-StableAudioSampler` extension is designed to provide a new stable audio sampling capability within ComfyUI, enabling users to create and experiment with various audio sequences and compositions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is meant by \"Load your own models\" in the extension?",
        "answer": "The statement \"Load your own models\" refers to the extension's capability to support loading different audio models, allowing users to experiment with a variety of audio samplers beyond those provided by the default models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `control_after_generate` option?",
        "answer": "The `control_after_generate` option is used to control the generation process after the initial sampling is completed, allowing for additional modifications and adjustments to the generated audio based on user-defined parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `forecast` feature operate within the extension?",
        "answer": "The `forecast` feature allows users to predict and simulate future audio sequences based on the parameters and choices made during the generation process. This is typically used for previewing and planning the development of longer audio compositions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the use of `cfg_scale`, `sigma_min`, and `steps` in the `audio-space-exploration.json` workflow.",
        "answer": "`cfg_scale`, `sigma_min`, and `steps` are parameters used within the `audio-space-exploration.json` workflow to create variations in the generated audio. `cfg_scale` controls the range of scale values generated, `sigma_min` determines the minimum width of the audio output, and `steps` sets the frequency of output generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model.safetensors` file contain?",
        "answer": "The `model.safetensors` file contains the saved model data, which can be loaded and accessed by ComfyUI to perform audio generation and sampling tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What options should be considered for error handling and debugging?",
        "answer": "When encountering issues such as the `progressbar` error, users should consider utilizing the extension's utility functions to resolve discrepancies. For example, the `util_discrepancies.py progressbar` script can be run to manage the `protobuf` issue, providing a workaround that ensures the module works correctly."
