        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI-seamless-tiling?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-seamless-tiling is a set of nodes in ComfyUI designed for generating seamless textures, replicating the 'Tiling' option from A1111, including independent X/Y tiling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use the 'Seamless Tile' node in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling?",
        "answer": "The 'Seamless Tile' node in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling should be used between the loader and samplers to modify the model for generating seamless textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two nodes available for decoding images in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-seamless-tiling offers two nodes for decoding images: 'Make Circular VAE' and 'Circular VAE Decode'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is more efficient for decoding images in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling and why?",
        "answer": "The 'Make Circular VAE' node is more efficient for decoding images in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling because it only modifies the VAE model once instead of on each decode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Offset Image' node in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling?",
        "answer": "The 'Offset Image' node in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling is used to check for seams in the generated textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "From where was the code for 'Circular VAE Decode' sourced?",
        "answer": "The code for 'Circular VAE Decode' in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling was sourced from https://github.com/FlyingFireCo/tiled_ksampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How was the X/Y tiling implementation in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling developed?",
        "answer": "The X/Y tiling implementation in ComfyUI-seamless-tiling was modified from https://github.com/tjm35/asymmetric-tiling-sd-webui."
