    {
        "question": "How should one install the 'pipeline-parallel-comfy' custom node?",
        "answer": "To install, one should clone the repository into the 'ComfyUI/custom_nodes' folder using 'git clone https://github.com/DeJoker/pipeline-parallel-comfy' and then restart ComfyUI."

        "question": "List the usage instructions for the 'pipeline-parallel-comfy' API.",
        "answer": "/parallel/prompt operates same as comfyui /prompt, but must include the workflow_name parameter when used. To verify results, one can use 'curl localhost:8080/parallel/history' command."

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between using '/parallel/prompt' and '/prompt' in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Both commands operate similarly with the primary difference being that '/parallel/prompt' requires the workflow_name parameter to be included when calling the API, whereas '/prompt' does not."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it necessary to restart ComfyUI after installing 'pipeline-parallel-comfy'?",
        "answer": "Restarting ComfyUI is necessary to ensure that all changes, including the addition of the new custom node, are properly loaded and integrated into the software, allowing it to function as expected."
