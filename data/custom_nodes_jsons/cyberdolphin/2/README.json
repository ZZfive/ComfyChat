        "question": "What is the purpose of the Cyber Dolphin custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Cyber Dolphin custom node in ComfyUI is used to get image prompts from OpenAI or a compatible API, with the default model being gpt-3.5-turbo."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default AI model used by the Cyber Dolphin node?",
        "answer": "The default AI model used by the Cyber Dolphin node is gpt-3.5-turbo."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Cyber Dolphin node be used with other AI models besides gpt-3.5-turbo?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Cyber Dolphin node can be used with other AI models that are compatible with the OpenAI API."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the example image 'cyberdolphin_example.png' demonstrate?",
        "answer": "The example image 'cyberdolphin_example.png' demonstrates a comparison between the results of DALLÂ·E and local Stable Diffusion models in generating images from text prompts obtained through the Cyber Dolphin node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Cyber Dolphin node compare to other methods of generating text prompts?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not explicitly compare the Cyber Dolphin node to other methods of generating text prompts. It only mentions that the node can be used to get image prompts from OpenAI or compatible APIs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Cyber Dolphin node be used to generate text prompts in languages other than English?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify whether the Cyber Dolphin node can generate text prompts in languages other than English. It would depend on the capabilities of the connected AI model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) and the API used."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Cyber Dolphin node limited to generating only image-related prompts?",
        "answer": "The documentation focuses on the use of the Cyber Dolphin node for generating image prompts. It does not mention other types of prompts that the node may be able to generate."
