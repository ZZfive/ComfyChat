    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Settings node in ComfyUI_smZNodes?",
        "answer": "The Settings node in ComfyUI_smZNodes is a dynamic node that functions similar to the Reroute node and is used to fine-tune results during sampling or tokenization."

    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI_smZNodes be installed?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_smZNodes can be installed via ComfyUI Manager, cloning the repository directly into the extensions directory, or downloading the project manually."

    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI_smZNodes be updated?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_smZNodes can be updated via ComfyUI Manager or by pulling the latest changes from the repository."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips to get reproducible results on both stable-diffusion-webui and ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "To get reproducible results on both stable-diffusion-webui and ComfyUI, use the same seed, sampler settings, RNG (CPU or GPU), clip skip (CLIP Set Last Layer), and adjust the unipc configuration accordingly on both UIs."
