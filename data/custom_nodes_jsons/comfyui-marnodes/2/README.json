    {
        "question": "Can you provide a list of workflow settings available in ComfyUI-Manager?",
        "answer": "The provided flow settings include a random latent size flow option, and there is more detailed information on these settings in the specific document."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a workflow flow in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The terminology doesn't clarify specifically, but a workflow flow in the context of ComfyUI might relate to part of a sequence of tasks, processes, or stages within the UI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some typical settings that could be managed by workflow settings?",
        "answer": "Workflow settings can manage things like latent sizes or other parameters related to the generation of visualize content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the purposes of string nodes?",
        "answer": "String nodes are used for something related to custom node controls. Their exact use isn't defined specifically in the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'material node colors' refer to in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "This likely refers to the use of different color schemes or materials to modulate UI elements."
