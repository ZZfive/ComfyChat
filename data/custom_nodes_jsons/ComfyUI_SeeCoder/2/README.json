        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConcatConditioning node?",
        "answer": "The ConcatConditioning node is used to concat different embeddings together, allowing you to create both a text and a visual embedding and concat them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the ConcatConditioning node require?",
        "answer": "The ConcatConditioning node requires a set of embeddings to concat something to (conditioning_to) and the embedding to concat behind those (conditioning_from) as inputs."
