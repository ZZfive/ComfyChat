        "question": "What are the additional features suggested under the visual section in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The additional features suggested under the visual section in ComfyUI include fill bucket and airbrush cursors for background inversion, extended editing options like an optional fill tolerance slider, transparency features like color opacity and blend/copy modes, and support for multi-sub-image documents with sub-image switching and undo/redo functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the fill bucket and airbrush cursors in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The fill bucket and airbrush cursors in ComfyUI are used for background inversion in parts of an image. However, they are incompatible with .png files, and Microsoft Edge requires .cur files for custom cursors. The author has .cur files in the repository for both the modern and classic themes."

    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI support multi-user sessions?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI can support multi-user sessions through the \"sessions.js\" file, which manages user edits, undo/redo, and cursor tracking. However, it lacks conflict resolution and is not eventually consistent, meaning user edits may revert other user edits."

        "answer": "Potential issues with online and local sessions in ComfyUI include conflicts where user edits may revert other user edits, lack of eventual consistency, and issues with cursors from other users going outside the parent window. Collaboration and multi-user support currently require improvements."
