        "question": "Which nodes are used in ComfyUI-Keyframed extension to facilitate parameter/prompt keyframing?",
        "answer": "The nodes in the extension support parameterizing animations whose prompts or other settings will change over time. The major nodes used are: `Keyframe`, `Curve`, `ParameterGroup`, `Keyframed Condition`, and `Schedule`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the basic object structure that ComfyUI-Keyframed nodes inherit from?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI nodes inherit from `keyframed` objects: `Keyframe`, `Curve`, and `ParameterGroup`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported interpolation methods in ComfyUI-Keyframed?",
        "answer": "The supported interpolation methods are: null, previous, next, linear, sine_wave, eased_lerp, and exp_decay."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule' node do in ComfyUI-Keyframed extension?",
        "answer": "The `schedule` node takes inputs from various nodes and combines them to facilitate transitions through a sequence of conditionings (i.e. prompts)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'keyframed-entangled-curves' node output?",
        "answer": "The `keyframed-entangled-curves` node outputs N sine wave curves whose phases are offset to be equally spaced and whose amplitudes are adjusted such that the sum of all curves is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'schedule-prompt' node work?",
        "answer": "The `schedule-prompt` node combines the nodes `CLIPTextEncode`, `Keyframed Condition`, and `Set Keyframe` to facilitate transitioning through a sequence of conditionings, commonly called a 'schedule'. This node is used to manage the positive prompt and build a 'prompt schedule'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Schedule' node in ComfyUI-Keyframed?",
        "answer": "The `Schedule` node is used to facilitate the transition through a sequence of conditionings, allowing for smooth and enhanced animation processes by with KSampler. It essentially manages how prompts change over time, enabling more dynamic and nuanced animations."
