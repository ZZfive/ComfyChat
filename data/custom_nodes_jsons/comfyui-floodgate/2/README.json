        "question": "What is ComfyUI Floodgate?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI Floodgate is an extension for ComfyUI that allows users to easily control the logic flow by toggling between different paths without reconnecting multiple nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the motivation behind developing Floodgate for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The motivation behind developing Floodgate is to provide a solution for easily switching between different workflows, such as Hires. Fix, without the need to connect and disconnect multiple nodes every time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Floodgate work in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, Floodgate works by connecting the output of a node to the source of the Floodgate node, then connecting each path to the desired remaining workflow. Users can toggle between the paths by clicking on the gate_open button."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Floodgate handle arbitrary types in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, Floodgate can connect any arbitrary types in ComfyUI, as long as the input and output types match."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is it possible to use multiple Floodgates in one workflow in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, users can have multiple Floodgates in one workflow and control each Floodgate individually in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "At what stage is the logic flow parsed in ComfyUI Floodgate?",
        "answer": "The logic flow is parsed during the queuing stage, not the execution stage, in ComfyUI Floodgate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be considered when using boolean values with Floodgate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "When using boolean values with Floodgate in ComfyUI, the value has to be already determined when pressing Queue Prompt, such as from the toggle or a primitive node. Using a node that outputs a boolean during execution will not work."
