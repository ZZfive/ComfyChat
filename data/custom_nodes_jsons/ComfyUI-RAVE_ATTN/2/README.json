        "question": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI-RAVE Attention?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE Attention is a custom node that uses RAVE attention as a temporal attention mechanism within the UNet's Self-Attention in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ComfyUI-RAVE Attention differ from other implementations?",
        "answer": "Unlike other implementations, ComfyUI-RAVE Attention does not concatenate images together. Instead, it performs the RAVE technique within the UNet's Self-Attention mechanism without altering the images or latents throughout the UNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of ComfyUI-RAVE Attention not altering images or latents?",
        "answer": "By not altering the images or latents, ComfyUI-RAVE Attention does not affect other temporal techniques, style mechanisms, or other UNet modifications, allowing it to be combined with tools like AnimateDiff, ModelScope/ZeroScope, or FLATTEN."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does ComfyUI-RAVE Attention require any additional packages for installation?",
        "answer": "No, ComfyUI-RAVE Attention does not require any additional packages for installation. Users just need to git clone the repository into their `custom_nodes/` directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can users find example workflows for ComfyUI-RAVE Attention?",
        "answer": "Users can find example workflows for ComfyUI-RAVE Attention in the `example_workflows` directory of the repository."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who are the researchers behind the RAVE implementation used in ComfyUI-RAVE Attention?",
        "answer": "The RAVE implementation used in ComfyUI-RAVE Attention was researched and open-sourced by Ozgur Kara, Bariscan Kurtkaya, Hidir Yesiltepe, James M. Rehg, and Pinar Yanardag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main benefit of using RAVE attention in ComfyUI-RAVE Attention?",
        "answer": "The main benefit of using RAVE attention in ComfyUI-RAVE Attention is that it provides a temporal attention mechanism within the UNet's Self-Attention, which helps in generating more coherent and consistent results in image and video generation tasks."
