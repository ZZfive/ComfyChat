        "question": "What is ComfyUI-FBCNN?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-FBCNN is a JPEG artifact/compression removal tool implemented as a custom node in ComfyUI, based on the FBCNN project."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where should this repository be placed for installation?",
        "answer": "This repository should be downloaded or cloned inside the ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the dependencies required for ComfyUI-FBCNN?",
        "answer": "The only dependencies required for ComfyUI-FBCNN are Pytorch, numpy, and requests, which should already be installed if you have ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the ComfyUI-FBCNN node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the ComfyUI-FBCNN node can be found under the 'image/upscaling' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'auto_detect' option in ComfyUI-FBCNN?",
        "answer": "The 'auto_detect' option in ComfyUI-FBCNN allows the model to automatically estimate the compression level of the image. If set to 'enabled', the built-in estimator will be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if 'auto_detect' is set to 'disabled' in ComfyUI-FBCNN?",
        "answer": "If 'auto_detect' is set to 'disabled' in ComfyUI-FBCNN, the user needs to provide the compression level value manually in the 'compression_level' setting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of values for the 'compression_level' setting in ComfyUI-FBCNN?",
        "answer": "The 'compression_level' setting in ComfyUI-FBCNN accepts a value between 0 and 100, similar to the compression level value used when compressing a JPEG image."
