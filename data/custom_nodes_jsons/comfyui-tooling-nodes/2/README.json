        "question": "What are the types of models that can be loaded as checkpoint in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The types of models that can be loaded as checkpoint in ComfyUI are: diffusion_models and checkpoint_file.safetensors. checkpoint_file.safetensors can have various base models such as sd15, sd20, sd21, sd3, sdxl, ssd1b, svd, cascade-b, cascade-c."

        "question": "How do the Language Directives work in the Translate Text node?",
        "answer": "The Language Directives in the Translate Text node helps in translating text fragments. It allows for multiple directives to be specified which change the language for any text that comes after until the next directive. The language to translate from is indicated by a _language directive_ of the form lang:xx where xx is a 2-letter language code. For example, lang:de translates `eine modische handtasche aus gr√ºnem kunstleder` into a fashionable handbag made of green suede."

        "question": "How does the ComfyUI API's GET /api/etn/model_info/{folder_name} endpoint work?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI API's GET /api/etn/model_info/{folder_name} endpoint provides information about various types of models that can be loaded as checkpoint. It takes a folder_name parameter that specifies the sub-directory in ComfyUI's models folder. Supported model types include checkpoints and diffusion_models. The endpoint returns a list of available models with additional classification information like the base_model, is_inpaint, and is_refiner."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tile Mask node in the Tiles module of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Tile Mask node in the Tiles module of ComfyUI is used to create a coverage mask for a certain tile. This mask is the size of the image tile and is a smooth transition depending on the chosen blend size. It matches the image area with white (1) and the padding area with black (0), facilitating the usage in 'Merge Image Tile', but also serves as input for 'Set Latent Noise Mask' in upscale workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI API's PUT /api/etn/upload/{folder_name}/{filename} endpoint work?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI API's PUT /api/etn/upload/{folder_name}/{filename} endpoint is used to upload a model to ComfyUI's local model folder. It requires a folder_name parameter that specifies the model type, matching one of the existing folders in ComfyUI's models folder. The filename parameter is the target filename for the model, which must not contain any path and should have a .safetensors extension. After successful upload, the endpoint returns a code of 201 and a status of 'success'. If the file already exists, it returns a code of 200 and a status of 'cached'. Invalid parameters result in a code of 400 with an error message."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the Creates Pigment Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Creates Pigment Mask node is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it seems to be part of the Tiles module for splitting an image into tiles to be processed individually. This node likely creates a mask of specific pigments or colors for each tile, which can then be used for various purposes such as separating different components in image tiles or applying specific color filters."
