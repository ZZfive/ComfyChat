        "question": "What is ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved is an improved integration of AnimateDiff for ComfyUI, along with advanced sampling options called Evolved Sampling that can be used outside of AnimateDiff."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some helpful node packs often used with AnimateDiff workflows in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some helpful node packs for AnimateDiff workflows in ComfyUI include ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet, ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite, comfyui_controlnet_aux, ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus, ComfyUI-KJNodes, and ComfyUI_FizzNodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two families of nodes that can be used to use AnimateDiff/Evolved Sampling in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The two families of nodes that can be used to use AnimateDiff/Evolved Sampling in ComfyUI are Gen1 and Gen2."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scale_multival' input in AnimateDiff nodes affect the generated motion?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_multival' input in AnimateDiff nodes directly influences the amount of motion generated by the model. It can accept a float, list of floats, and/or mask inputs, allowing different scale to be applied to different frames or areas of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'effect_multival' input in AnimateDiff nodes determine?",
        "answer": "The 'effect_multival' input in AnimateDiff nodes determines the influence of the motion models on the sampling process. A value of 0.0 is equivalent to normal Stable Diffusion output with no AnimateDiff influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Sample Settings node in ComfyUI be used?",
        "answer": "The Sample Settings node in ComfyUI allows customization of the sampling process beyond what is exposed on most KSampler nodes. It enables features like FreeNoise and FreeInit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the known issues with some motion models in ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved?",
        "answer": "Some motion models, especially mm_sd_v15, may have visible watermarks on the resulting images because the training data used by the authors contained Shutterstock watermarks. Using other motion modules or combinations of them can help alleviate this issue."
