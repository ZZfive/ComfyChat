        "question": "How do you edit images with the Unprompted node?",
        "answer": "As of version 0.2.0, the Unprompted node supports image editing through the `anything` input. To edit an image, you can utilize the `set_anything_to` widget to set an image to a `comfy_var` variable, which is then referenced via the `[image_edit]` shortcode. For instance, to edit an image, you would use the following command:\n\n```\n[image_edit input=\"comfy_var\" add_noise=500]\n```\n\nEnsure that the `return_image_var` widget refers to `comfy_var` so that the changes are visible in the Preview Image node."
