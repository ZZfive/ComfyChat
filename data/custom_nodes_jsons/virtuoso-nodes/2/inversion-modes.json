        "question": "What are the four inversion modes included in the virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The four inversion modes included in the virtuoso-nodes are: Difference Mode, Exclusion Mode, Subtract Mode, and Divide Mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Difference Mode in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Difference Mode in virtuoso-nodes is one of the inversion modes, intended to alter the image by calculating the difference between the base image and the blend image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Exclusion Mode in virtuoso-nodes differ from the Difference Mode?",
        "answer": "While both Exclusion Mode and Difference Mode are inversion modes in virtuoso-nodes, Exclusion Mode uses a different blending algorithm to create the inverted effect compared to the Difference Mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the function of the Subtract Mode in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Subtract Mode in virtuoso-nodes is an inversion mode that subtracts the blend image from the base image to create an inverted effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the Divide Mode in virtuoso-nodes have on images?",
        "answer": "The Divide Mode in virtuoso-nodes is an inversion mode that divides the base image by the blend image to create an inverted effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are there visual examples provided for each of the inversion modes in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "Yes, the documentation for virtuoso-nodes includes visual examples for each of the inversion modes: Difference Mode, Exclusion Mode, Subtract Mode, and Divide Mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source of the virtuoso-nodes inversion modes documentation?",
        "answer": "The documentation for the inversion modes of virtuoso-nodes is sourced from the GitHub repository of virtuoso-nodes, specifically from the images and descriptions provided."
