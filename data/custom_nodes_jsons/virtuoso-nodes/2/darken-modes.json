        "question": "What is the purpose of the Darken Mode in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Darken Mode in virtuoso-nodes is used to darken the base image using the color information from the blend layer."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Multiply Mode in virtuoso-nodes work?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Mode in virtuoso-nodes multiplies the color values of the base image by the blend layer colors, resulting in a darker image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the Color Burn Mode have on the base image in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Color Burn Mode in virtuoso-nodes darkens the base image by increasing the contrast with the blend layer colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Linear Burn Mode in virtuoso-nodes differ from the Color Burn Mode?",
        "answer": "The Linear Burn Mode in virtuoso-nodes darkens the base image by subtracting the blend layer color values from the base image, while the Color Burn Mode increases contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Darker Color Mode in virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Darker Color Mode in virtuoso-nodes compares the base image and blend layer colors, and keeps the darker of the two for each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which modes are included in the Darken Modes category of virtuoso-nodes?",
        "answer": "The Darken Modes category in virtuoso-nodes includes Darken Mode, Multiply Mode, Color Burn Mode, Linear Burn Mode, and Darker Color Mode."

    {
        "question": "Does the Darken Mode in virtuoso-nodes completely replace the base image colors?",
        "answer": "No, the Darken Mode in virtuoso-nodes does not completely replace the base image colors. It only darkens the base image using the color information from the blend layer."
