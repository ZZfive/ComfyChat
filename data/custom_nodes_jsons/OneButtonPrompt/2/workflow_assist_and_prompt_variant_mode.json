        "question": "What does the prompt variant slider in OneButtonPrompt do?",
        "answer": "The prompt variant slider in OneButtonPrompt creates variants of the workflow prompt. It determines how many alternate universes away it should take the prompt from, essentially creating slightly alternative prompts."

    {
        "question": "How does increasing the prompt variance level affect the generated prompts?",
