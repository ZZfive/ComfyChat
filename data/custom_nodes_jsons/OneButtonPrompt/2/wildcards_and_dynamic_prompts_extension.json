        "question": "What are wildcards in OneButtonPrompt?",
        "answer": "Wildcards in OneButtonPrompt are special placeholders that can be used in the prompt prefix, prompt suffix, and subject override fields. They get values from their specific related lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use the -subjectfromfile- wildcard in OneButtonPrompt?",
        "answer": "To use the -subjectfromfile- wildcard in OneButtonPrompt, you need to place a file called custom_subjects.csv in the user_files folder. When this wildcard is used, it will select a random value from the file, and it is suggested to be used in the Overwrite Subject field."

        "question": "What is the relationship between OneButtonPrompt and the Dynamic Prompts extension?",
        "answer": "The Dynamic Prompts extension can be considered the father of OneButtonPrompt, while StylePile is its mother. OneButtonPrompt can be combined with Dynamic Prompts, allowing the use of wildcards supported by Dynamic Prompts in the prompt prefix, prompt suffix, and subject override fields."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does OneButtonPrompt support the Dynamic Prompts syntax?",
        "answer": "OneButtonPrompt supports the Dynamic Prompts syntax of {cat|dog}, which allows switching during batch processing. This means that if you have managed your own wildcards before, you can use them in OneButtonPrompt as well, using the standard settings like __ __wildcardname__ __."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide an example of how to use OneButtonPrompt with the Dynamic Prompts extension?",
        "answer": "Yes, an example is setting the Subject Types to \"animal\", Artists to \"sci-fi\" or \"none\", and Type of image to \"digital art\". Then, set the Overwrite subject to \"cyberpunk __ __bird__ __ with -material- implants\", using a bird.txt wildcard file in the appropriate directory. This will generate images of cyberpunk birds with various materials as implants."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use the {cat|dog} basic usage syntax in OneButtonPrompt?",
        "answer": "To use the {cat|dog} basic usage syntax in OneButtonPrompt, set the Subject Types to \"animal\", Artists to \"sculpture\", and Overwrite type of image to \"sculpture\". Then, set the Overwrite subject to \"{cat|dog}\" and run with multiple batches to see it switch between cat and dog sculptures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of using wildcards and syntax like {cat|dog} in OneButtonPrompt?",
        "answer": "The purpose of using wildcards and syntax like {cat|dog} in OneButtonPrompt is to add variety and flexibility to the generated images. It allows users to easily switch between different subjects, materials, and styles during batch processing, creating a diverse range of images with minimal effort."
