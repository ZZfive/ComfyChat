        "question": "What is the purpose of the fastblend node in ComfyUI-fastblend?",
        "answer": "The fastblend node in ComfyUI-fastblend is used to smooth videos, either by rendering each frame (smoothvideo) or by selecting a portion of frames to render (interpolateKeyFrame)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'accuracy' parameter in the fastblend node control?",
        "answer": "In the fastblend node, the 'accuracy' parameter determines the quality of the smoothing effect, where a larger value is better, and 1 is sufficient for most situations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'window_size' parameter affect the fastblend node?",
        "answer": "The 'window_size' parameter in the fastblend node determines the smoothness of the resulting video, with a larger window size resulting in a smoother video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'minimum_patch_size' parameter in the fastblend node?",
        "answer": "The 'minimum_patch_size' parameter in the fastblend node is an important setting that must be an odd number, and a larger value generally yields better results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'num_iter' parameter in the fastblend node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'num_iter' parameter in the fastblend node represents the number of iterations the algorithm performs, with a larger value leading to better results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Guide weight' parameter influence the fastblend node?",
        "answer": "The 'Guide weight' parameter in the fastblend node determines how much motion feature is applied to the style video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the rebatchimage node in ComfyUI-fastblend?",
        "answer": "The rebatchimage node in ComfyUI-fastblend is designed to speed up the rendering process by simultaneously rendering images, resulting in a speed increase of approximately 40%."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the myopenpose node in ComfyUI-fastblend improve upon existing solutions?",
        "answer": "The myopenpose node in ComfyUI-fastblend combines the strengths of dw_openpose and openpose, allowing for better identification of a person's back during turns while maintaining accurate pose detection."
