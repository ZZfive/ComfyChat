        "question": "What is Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 is a text-to-image latent diffusion model built upon the work of the original Stable Diffusion, led by Robin Rombach and Katherine Crowson from Stability AI and LAION."
    },
    {
        "question": "What new text encoder does Stable Diffusion 2 use?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 uses a brand new text encoder called OpenCLIP, developed by LAION with support from Stability AI, which greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dataset is used to train Stable Diffusion 2 models?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the LAION-5B dataset created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using LAION's NSFW filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended scheduler for Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "The recommended scheduler for Stable Diffusion 2 is the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler, as it gives a reasonable speed/quality trade-off and can be run with as little as 20 steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What tasks is Stable Diffusion 2 available for?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion 2 is available for tasks like text-to-image, inpainting, super-resolution, and depth-to-image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the default resolutions for the text-to-image models in Stable Diffusion 2?",
        "answer": "The text-to-image models in Stable Diffusion 2 can generate images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find more details about how Stable Diffusion 2 works and how it differs from the original Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "For more details about how Stable Diffusion 2 works and how it differs from the original Stable Diffusion, please refer to the official announcement post at https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release."
