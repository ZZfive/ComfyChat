        "question": "What is unconditional image generation?",
        "answer": "Unconditional image generation is a process of generating images that are similar to the training data distribution without any conditions such as text or images, unlike text-to-image or image-to-image models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What needs to be installed before running the training scripts for unconditional image generation models?",
        "answer": "Before running the training scripts for unconditional image generation models, you need to install the dependency libraries by running `pip install diffusers[training] accelerate datasets`."

        "question": "How can you initialize the ðŸ¤— Accelerate environment with default settings in a non-interactive shell environment?",
        "answer": "In a non-interactive shell environment, you can initialize the ðŸ¤— Accelerate environment with default settings by using the following Python code: `from accelerate.utils import write_basic_config; write_basic_config()`."

    {
        "question": "What argument should be added to the training script to upload the model to the hub?",
        "answer": "To upload the model to the hub, you should add the `--push_to_hub` argument to the training script."

    {
        "question": "How often are checkpoints saved when the `--checkpointing_steps=500` argument is passed to the training script?",
        "answer": "When the `--checkpointing_steps=500` argument is passed to the training script, checkpoints are saved every 500 steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you resume training from a specific checkpoint?",
        "answer": "To resume training from a specific checkpoint, you can pass the `--resume_from_checkpoint` argument to the training script with the checkpoint name, for example: `--resume_from_checkpoint=\"checkpoint-1500\"`."
