        "question": "What is 'Safe Stable Diffusion' and how does it address the issues of inappropriate degeneration in diffusion models?",
        "answer": "Safe Stable Diffusion is a feature that mitigates the well-known issue of models like Stable Diffusion, which are trained on unfiltered, web-crawled datasets, tending to suffer from inappropriate degeneration. It is based on the paper 'Safe Latent Diffusion: Mitigating Inappropriate Degeneration in Diffusion Models'."
