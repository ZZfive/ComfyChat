        "question": "What is ControlNet?",
        "answer": "ControlNet is a neural network architecture that adds spatial conditioning controls to large, pretrained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. It allows users to provide an additional control image to condition and control the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some examples of conditioning controls that can be used with ControlNet?",
        "answer": "Examples of conditioning controls that can be used with ControlNet include edges, depth, segmentation, and human poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does ControlNet work with small and large datasets?",
        "answer": "Yes, the training of ControlNets is robust with both small (<50k) and large (>1m) datasets."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who contributed the ControlNet model?",
        "answer": "The ControlNet model was contributed by takuma104."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase for ControlNet be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for ControlNet can be found at lllyasviel/ControlNet on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can official ControlNet checkpoints be found?",
        "answer": "Official ControlNet checkpoints can be found on lllyasviel's Hugging Face Hub profile."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some pipelines associated with ControlNet?",
        "answer": "Some pipelines associated with ControlNet include StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline, StableDiffusionControlNetImg2ImgPipeline, and StableDiffusionControlNetInpaintPipeline."
