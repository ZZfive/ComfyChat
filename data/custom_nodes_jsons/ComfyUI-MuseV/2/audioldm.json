        "question": "What is AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM is a text-to-audio latent diffusion model that learns continuous audio representations from CLAP latents. It takes a text prompt as input and predicts the corresponding audio, able to generate text-conditional sound effects, human speech and music."
    },
    {
        "question": "What was AudioLDM inspired by?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM was inspired by Stable Diffusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does AudioLDM learn from CLAP latents?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM learns continuous audio representations from CLAP latents."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can AudioLDM generate?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM can generate text-conditional sound effects, human speech and music."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM is advantageous in both generation quality and computational efficiency by learning the latent representations of audio signals and their compositions without modeling the cross-modal relationship."

        "question": "What is the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations in a zero-shot fashion?",
        "answer": "AudioLDM is the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations in a zero-shot fashion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips for constructing an effective prompt for AudioLDM?",
        "answer": "Some tips for constructing an effective prompt for AudioLDM include using descriptive inputs with adjectives to describe the sound, making the prompt context specific, and using general terms instead of specific names or abstract objects the model may not be familiar with."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the quality of the predicted audio sample be controlled during inference?",
        "answer": "The quality of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by the 'num_inference_steps' argument; higher steps give higher quality audio at the expense of slower inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the length of the predicted audio sample be controlled?",
        "answer": "The length of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by varying the 'audio_length_in_s' argument."
