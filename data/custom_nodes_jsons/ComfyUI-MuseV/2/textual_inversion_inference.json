        "question": "What is textual inversion in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "Textual inversion is a technique supported by StableDiffusionPipeline in ComfyUI-MuseV that allows models like stable diffusion to learn new concepts from just a few sample images, enabling better control over generated images and fine-tuning the model for specific concepts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users quickly try out community-created concepts in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "Users can quickly try out community-created concepts through the Stable Diffusion Conceptualizer in ComfyUI-MuseV."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should users do if they want to learn how to train new concepts with textual inversion in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "If users want to learn how to train new concepts with textual inversion in ComfyUI-MuseV, they should refer to the Textual Inversion training guide."

    {
        "question": "What is the special placeholder token used to create prompts with pre-trained concepts in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The special placeholder token used to create prompts with pre-trained concepts in ComfyUI-MuseV is `<cat-toy>`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can users adjust the quality of generated images in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "Users can adjust the quality of generated images in ComfyUI-MuseV by tuning parameters such as num_inference_steps and guidance_scale."
