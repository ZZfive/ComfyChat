        "question": "What is the purpose of the VaeImageProcessor in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The VaeImageProcessor provides a unified API for StableDiffusionPipelines to prepare image inputs for VAE encoding and post-processing outputs once they're decoded in ComfyUI-MuseV."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of transformations does the VaeImageProcessor perform?",
        "answer": "The VaeImageProcessor performs transformations such as resizing, normalization, and conversion between PIL Image, PyTorch, and NumPy arrays."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of image inputs do pipelines with VaeImageProcessor accept?",
        "answer": "Pipelines with VaeImageProcessor accept PIL Image, PyTorch tensor, or NumPy arrays as image inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you pass encoded image latents directly to the pipeline and return latents from the pipeline in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "You can pass encoded image latents directly to the pipeline and return latents from the pipeline by using the output_type argument (for example output_type=\"latent\")."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the VaeImageProcessorLDM3D in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The VaeImageProcessorLDM3D in ComfyUI-MuseV accepts RGB and depth inputs and returns RGB and depth outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the VaeImageProcessorLDM3D a specific implementation of the VaeImageProcessor in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "Yes, the VaeImageProcessorLDM3D is a specific implementation of the VaeImageProcessor in ComfyUI-MuseV designed to handle RGB and depth information."
