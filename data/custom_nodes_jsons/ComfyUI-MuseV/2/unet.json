        "question": "What was the original purpose of the UNet model?",
        "answer": "The UNet model was originally introduced for biomedical image segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the UNet model commonly used in ðŸ¤— Diffusers?",
        "answer": "The UNet model is commonly used in ðŸ¤— Diffusers because it outputs images that are the same size as the input."

    {
        "question": "What are the different variants of the UNet model in ðŸ¤— Diffusers?",
        "answer": "The variants of the UNet model in ðŸ¤— Diffusers depend on the number of dimensions and whether it is a conditional model or not."
