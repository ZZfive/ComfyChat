        "question": "What are Latent Consistency Models (LCMs)?",
        "answer": "Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) are models that enable swift inference with minimal steps on any pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), including Stable Diffusion. They are designed to directly predict the solution of an augmented probability flow ODE in latent space, mitigating the need for numerous iterations and allowing rapid, high-fidelity sampling."
