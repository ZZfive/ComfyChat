        "question": "What is inpainting in the context of Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "Inpainting in Stable Diffusion allows you to edit specific parts of an image by providing a mask and a text prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which checkpoints are recommended for inpainting with Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to use checkpoints specifically fine-tuned for inpainting, such as runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting. Default text-to-image checkpoints like runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 are also compatible but may be less performant."
