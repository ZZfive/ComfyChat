        "question": "What hardware is required to use Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon?",
        "answer": "To use Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon, you need a Mac computer with M1 or M2 hardware."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operating system version is recommended for running Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to use macOS 13.0 or later, although macOS 12.6 or later is the minimum requirement."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which PyTorch version is recommended for using Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon?",
        "answer": "PyTorch 2.0 or later is recommended for using Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon, as it resolves several issues present in earlier versions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the one-time priming pass when using PyTorch 1.13?",
        "answer": "The one-time priming pass is a temporary workaround for an issue in PyTorch 1.13, where the first inference pass produces slightly different results compared to subsequent passes. This pass only needs to be performed once, and the result can be discarded."
    },
    {
        "question": "When is it recommended to enable attention slicing?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to enable attention slicing when your computer has 64GB or less of RAM, or when generating images at non-standard resolutions larger than 512 Ã— 512 pixels. This helps reduce memory pressure and prevent swapping during inference."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does attention slicing affect performance on Apple Silicon computers?",
        "answer": "Attention slicing typically impacts performance by ~20% on general-purpose memory-limited computers. However, on most Apple Silicon computers with less than 64GB of RAM, it has been observed to provide better overall performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the known issue with generating multiple prompts in a batch on Apple Silicon?",
        "answer": "Generating multiple prompts in a batch on Apple Silicon can result in crashes or unstable behavior. This issue is believed to be related to the PyTorch `mps` backend and is currently being worked on. It is recommended to use iteration instead of batching for now."
