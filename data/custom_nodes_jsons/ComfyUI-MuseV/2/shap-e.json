        "question": "What is ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-MuseV is an extension or plugin for ComfyUI that integrates the Shap-E model for generating 3D assets from text prompts or images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can Shap-E be used for?",
        "answer": "Shap-E can be used for generating 3D assets for video game development, interior design, and architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the Shap-E model trained?",
        "answer": "The Shap-E model is trained in two steps: 1) an encoder accepts point clouds and rendered views of a 3D asset and outputs the parameters of implicit functions representing the asset, and 2) a diffusion model is trained on the latents produced by the encoder to generate either neural radiance fields (NeRFs) or a textured 3D mesh."
    },
    {
        "question": "What pipelines are available in ComfyUI-MuseV for generating 3D assets?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-MuseV provides two pipelines: ShapEPipeline for text-to-3D generation and ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for image-to-3D generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `export_to_gif` function in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The `export_to_gif` function in ComfyUI-MuseV is used to turn a list of image frames generated by the pipeline into a GIF of the 3D object."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can ComfyUI-MuseV generate mesh outputs?",
        "answer": "Yes, ComfyUI-MuseV can generate mesh outputs by specifying the `output_type` parameter as 'mesh' in the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What formats can the mesh output be saved as in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The mesh output in ComfyUI-MuseV can be saved as `ply` or `obj` files using the `export_to_ply` or `export_to_obj` functions, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the default viewpoint of the mesh output be changed in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The default viewpoint of the mesh output in ComfyUI-MuseV can be changed by applying a rotation transform using the trimesh library."
