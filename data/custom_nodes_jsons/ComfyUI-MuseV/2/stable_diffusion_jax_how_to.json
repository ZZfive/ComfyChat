    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'create_key' function in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The 'create_key' function in ComfyUI-MuseV initializes a random number generator using a seed, allowing for reproducibility of results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ComfyUI-MuseV handle parallelization across multiple devices?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-MuseV handles parallelization by using jax.pmap to compile and run code in parallel across available devices, with each device receiving different input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the advantage of using the 'block_until_ready' function in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The 'block_until_ready' function in ComfyUI-MuseV allows for accurate measurement of inference time by blocking until the computation result is ready."
