        "question": "What is DPMSolverMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "DPMSolverMultistep is a multistep scheduler from DPM-Solver and DPM-Solver++ by Cheng Lu, Yuhao Zhou, Fan Bao, Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, and Jun Zhu."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many steps does DPMSolver sampling need to generate high-quality samples?",
        "answer": "Empirically, DPMSolver sampling with only 20 steps can generate high-quality samples, and it can generate quite good samples even in 10 steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended solver_order for guide sampling and unconditional sampling in DPMSolverMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to set solver_order to 2 for guide sampling, and solver_order=3 for unconditional sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does DPMSolverMultistepScheduler support dynamic thresholding?",
        "answer": "Yes, dynamic thresholding from Imagen is supported. For pixel-space diffusion models, you can set both algorithm_type=\"dpmsolver++\" and thresholding=True to use the dynamic thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is dynamic thresholding suitable for latent-space diffusion models in DPMSolverMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "No, this thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is supported in the SDE variant of DPMSolver and DPM-Solver++?",
        "answer": "The SDE variant of DPMSolver and DPM-Solver++ supports only the first and second-order solvers. This is a fast SDE solver for the reverse diffusion SDE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended SDE solver for DPMSolverMultistepScheduler?",
        "answer": "It is recommended to use the second-order sde-dpmsolver++."
