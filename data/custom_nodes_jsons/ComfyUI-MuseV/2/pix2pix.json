        "question": "What is InstructPix2Pix?",
        "answer": "InstructPix2Pix is a method for editing images from human instructions. Given an input image and a written instruction, the model follows these instructions to edit the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who are the authors of the InstructPix2Pix paper?",
        "answer": "The authors of the InstructPix2Pix paper are Tim Brooks, Aleksander Holynski and Alexei A. Efros."
    },
    {
        "question": "How was training data obtained for InstructPix2Pix?",
        "answer": "Training data for InstructPix2Pix was obtained by combining the knowledge of two large pretrained models - a language model (GPT-3) and a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) - to generate a large dataset of image editing examples."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does InstructPix2Pix require per example fine-tuning or inversion?",
        "answer": "No, InstructPix2Pix does not require per example fine-tuning or inversion. It performs edits in the forward pass, allowing it to edit images quickly, in a matter of seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can additional information about InstructPix2Pix be found?",
        "answer": "Additional information about InstructPix2Pix can be found on the project page, the original codebase, and a demo can be tried out as well."
