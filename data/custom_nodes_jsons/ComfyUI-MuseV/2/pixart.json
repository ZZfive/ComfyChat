        "question": "What is PixArt-α?",
        "answer": "PixArt-α is a Transformer-based text-to-image diffusion model that generates high-quality images competitive with state-of-the-art image generators, while being more efficient in terms of training cost and time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PixArt-α compare to other text-to-image models in terms of training cost?",
        "answer": "PixArt-α's training cost is significantly lower than other large-scale text-to-image models. For example, it only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 and reducing 90% CO2 emissions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three core designs proposed in PixArt-α to achieve its goals?",
        "answer": "The three core designs proposed in PixArt-α are: (1) Training strategy decomposition, (2) Efficient T2I Transformer, and (3) High-informative data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PixArt-α handle text conditions?",
        "answer": "PixArt-α was trained using text conditions computed from T5, which makes the pipeline better at following complex text prompts with intricate details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is PixArt-α's performance in generating high-resolution images?",
        "answer": "PixArt-α is good at producing high-resolution images at different aspect ratios, with the authors recommending certain size brackets for best results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PixArt-α compare to other state-of-the-art text-to-image generation systems?",
        "answer": "PixArt-α rivals the quality of state-of-the-art text-to-image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion XL, Imagen, and DALL-E 2, while being more efficient than them."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can one find the original codebase and available checkpoints for PixArt-α?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for PixArt-α can be found at PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha on GitHub, and all the available checkpoints can be found at PixArt-alpha on HuggingFace."
