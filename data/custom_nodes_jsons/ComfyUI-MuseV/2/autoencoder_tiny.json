    {
        "question": "How can you use TAESD with Stable Diffusion v-2.1?",
        "answer": "To use TAESD with Stable Diffusion v-2.1, you need to load the DiffusionPipeline from the 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base' checkpoint, load the AutoencoderTiny from the 'madebyollin/taesd' checkpoint, and replace the VAE in the pipeline with the loaded AutoencoderTiny."

    {
        "question": "How can you use TAESD with Stable Diffusion XL 1.0?",
        "answer": "To use TAESD with Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, you need to load the DiffusionPipeline from the 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0' checkpoint, load the AutoencoderTiny from the 'madebyollin/taesdxl' checkpoint, and replace the VAE in the pipeline with the loaded AutoencoderTiny."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of AutoencoderTiny in MuseVdiffusers?",
        "answer": "AutoencoderTiny in MuseVdiffusers is used to quickly decode the latents in a StableDiffusionPipeline or StableDiffusionXLPipeline, allowing for faster image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is AutoencoderTinyOutput in MuseVdiffusers?",
        "answer": "AutoencoderTinyOutput is a class in MuseVdiffusers that represents the output of the AutoencoderTiny model."
