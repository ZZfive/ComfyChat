        "question": "What is the purpose of unconditional image generation?",
        "answer": "Unconditional image generation is a relatively simple task where the model generates images similar to the learned training data without any additional conditions such as text or images."

        "question": "What is the easiest way to use a pre-trained diffusion system for inference?",
        "answer": "The easiest way to use a pre-trained diffusion system for inference is by using the 'DiffusionPipeline' from MuseVdiffusers."

    {
        "question": "How can you specify the checkpoint for the pipeline to download?",
        "answer": "You can specify the checkpoint for the pipeline to download by choosing one of the diffusion checkpoints from the hub when creating an instance of 'DiffusionPipeline'."

        "question": "What is the recommended device to run the diffusion model with 1.4 billion parameters?",
        "answer": "It is strongly recommended to run the diffusion model with 1.4 billion parameters on a GPU."

    {
        "question": "How can you move the generator object to a GPU in PyTorch?",
        "answer": "You can move the generator object to a GPU in PyTorch by calling the 'to()' method on the generator object, like 'generator.to('cuda')'."

        "question": "What is the default output format of the generated images?",
        "answer": "The default output format of the generated images is a PIL.Image object."

    {
        "question": "How can you save the generated image?",
        "answer": "You can save the generated image by calling the 'save()' method on the image object, like 'image.save('generated_image.png')'."
