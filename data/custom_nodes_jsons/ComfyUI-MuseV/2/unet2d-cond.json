        "question": "What is the purpose of the UNet model in ðŸ¤— Diffusers?",
        "answer": "The UNet model is one of the most important components of a diffusion system in ðŸ¤— Diffusers because it facilitates the actual diffusion process and outputs images that are the same size as the input."

    {
        "question": "How does the architecture of the UNet model in the paper facilitate precise localization?",
        "answer": "The architecture of the UNet model consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization."

    {
        "question": "What is the performance of the UNet model in segmenting a 512x512 image?",
        "answer": "According to the paper, segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU using the UNet model."
