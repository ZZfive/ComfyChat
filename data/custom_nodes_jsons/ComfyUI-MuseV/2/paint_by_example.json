        "question": "What is the purpose of Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example is an exemplar-guided image editing technique that allows for more precise control by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main challenge addressed in the Paint by Example paper?",
        "answer": "The main challenge addressed in the paper is avoiding obvious fusing artifacts when using the naive approach of disentangling and re-organizing the source image and exemplar."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Paint by Example avoid fusing artifacts?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example avoids fusing artifacts by proposing an information bottleneck and using strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Paint by Example ensure controllability of the editing process?",
        "answer": "Paint by Example ensures controllability of the editing process by designing an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leveraging the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does Paint by Example require iterative optimization?",
        "answer": "No, the Paint by Example framework involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any iterative optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the original codebase for Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for Paint by Example can be found at Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there a demo available for Paint by Example?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can try out Paint by Example in a demo on the Hugging Face Spaces platform at Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example."
