        "question": "What is the purpose of the CMStochasticIterativeScheduler in ComfyUI-MuseV?",
        "answer": "The CMStochasticIterativeScheduler in ComfyUI-MuseV is capable of generating good samples in one or a small number of steps using the Consistency Models approach."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of using Consistency Models for image generation?",
        "answer": "Consistency Models support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can Consistency Models be trained?",
        "answer": "Consistency Models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether."
    },
    {
        "question": "What benchmarks have Consistency Models outperformed on?",
        "answer": "Consistency Models have outperformed existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the original codebase for Consistency Models be found?",
        "answer": "The original codebase for Consistency Models can be found at openai/consistency_models on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the state-of-the-art FID achieved by Consistency Models on CIFAR-10 for one-step generation?",
        "answer": "Consistency Models achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 for one-step generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the state-of-the-art FID achieved by Consistency Models on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation?",
        "answer": "Consistency Models achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation."
