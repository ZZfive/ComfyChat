        "question": "How can I clean up the IndexedDB if it's in a bad state?",
        "answer": "To clean up the IndexedDB, you need to delete the current IndexedDB from the Application tab in the developer tools (F12 -> Application -> IndexedDB). Make sure you have .json files under 'ComfyUI/comfyui-workspace-manager/db' to recover your data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I recover data like version history and gallery image data after deleting IndexedDB?",

        "question": "What modifications are required in the 'ComfyUI/web/index.html' file to enable Hot Module Replacement?",
        "answer": "To enable Hot Module Replacement, you need to add a code snippet in the 'ComfyUI/web/index.html' file. The code snippet should include the import of RefreshRuntime, the injection of the global hook, the definition of window.$RefreshReg$ and window.$RefreshSig$, setting the preamble installed flag, and appending the Vite client script and workspace main script to the head of the document."
