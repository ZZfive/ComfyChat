    {
        "question": "What are the concerns with using GRL models for upscaling?",
        "answer": "The concerns with using GRL models for upscaling include: 1) They are not very memory efficient, 2) The processing speed is slow for Transformer models, and 3) It is hard to adapt them for TensorRT deployment."

        "question": "What is the scale of the 2x_APISR_RRDB_GAN_generator model?",
        "answer": "The scale of the 2x_APISR_RRDB_GAN_generator model is 2X."

    {
        "question": "Why does the author prefer RRDB models over GRL models for diverse upscaling?",
        "answer": "The author prefers RRDB models over GRL models for diverse upscaling because GRL models are not memory efficient, have slow processing speed for Transformer models, and are hard to adapt for TensorRT deployment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the author plan to train GRL networks for other weights?",
        "answer": "No, the author does not plan to train GRL networks for other weights due to the mentioned concerns with GRL models."
