        "question": "Describe how cg-noise generates variations in images.",
        "answer": "cg-noise generates variations in images by using a weight `x` and two seeds. It generates the noise based on `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)`. The advantage to this is that it lets the user have slight variations in the initial noise to revert it to it's true nature."
