        "question": "What is the purpose of the comparison shown in the document?",
        "answer": "The comparison shows the results of using different pooling modes (1D and 2D) with and without the comfyui_slothful_attention custom node in ComfyUI, using two different models: SSD-1B based model with lcm-lora and SD 1.5 based model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the specific models used in the comparison?",
        "answer": "The comparison uses two models: SSD-1B based model with lcm-lora (checkpoint: ssd-1b-animagine, lcm-lora: lcm-animagine) and SD 1.5 based model (checkpoint: Blazing Drive v10g)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What sampler and scheduler were used for the SSD-1B based model?",
        "answer": "For the SSD-1B based model, the sampler used was lcm and the scheduler was normal."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many steps and what cfg value were used for the SD 1.5 based model?",
        "answer": "For the SD 1.5 based model, 16 steps were used with a cfg value of 5.0."

    {
        "question": "What are the different pooling modes compared in the document?",
        "answer": "The document compares two pooling modes: AVG (average) and MAX (maximum), each in 1D and 2D variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the images generated with the tuned parameters compare to those without the comfyui_slothful_attention node?",
        "answer": "The document shows that images generated with the tuned parameters using the comfyui_slothful_attention node have improved quality and details compared to those generated without the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the 'Initial parameters' and 'Tuned parameters' columns in the comparison tables?",
        "answer": "The 'Initial parameters' column shows results with the blend value set to 0, while the 'Tuned parameters' column shows results with adjusted parameters for the comfyui_slothful_attention node."
