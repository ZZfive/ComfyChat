        "question": "What is the purpose of the GTF Utilities in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GTF Utilities in ComfyUI are a set of custom nodes designed to provide fundamental operations that can be composited to create complex image processing operations. They operate on a generalized tensor format that can be converted to and from images, latents, and masks, allowing for the combination of raw tensors from these sources. These nodes are implemented using PyTorch and have no external dependencies."

        "question": "What is a generalized tensor format (GTF)?",
        "answer": "A generalized tensor format (GTF) is a data format used by the GTF Utilities in ComfyUI. It can be converted to and from images, latents, and masks, allowing for the combination of raw tensors from these sources. This format is intended to be flexible and can be used in various contexts, making it a powerful tool for image processing algorithms and methods."

    {
        "question": "How do the GTF Utilities allow for combining raw tensors?",
        "answer": "The GTF Utilities in ComfyUI allow for combining raw tensors by operating on a generalized tensor format that can be converted to and from images, latents, and masks. This means that it is possible to mix and match data from different sources and formats, providing a flexible and powerful framework for image processing."

    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using the GTF Utilities in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary benefits of using the GTF Utilities in ComfyUI include:\n\n- Flexibility: The GTF Utilities provide a generalized tensor format that can be converted to and from multiple types, including images, latents, and masks. This allows for the combination of raw tensors from different sources, providing a flexible framework for image processing.\n- Composability: The GTF Utilities are designed with a selection of fundamental operations that can be composited together to create more complex operations. This modular approach ensures that the tools provided by the GTF Utilities can be used effectively to solve a wide range of image processing problems."

        "question": "What is the difference between the GTF Utilities and a generalized tensor format?",
        "answer": "The GTF Utilities in ComfyUI and a generalized tensor format (GTF) are related concepts, but they serve different purposes. A GTF is a data format that can be converted to and from images, latents, and masks, allowing for the combination of raw tensors from these sources. On the other hand, the GTF Utilities in ComfyUI are a set of custom nodes that use a GTF to provide implementations or building blocks for a variety of image processing algorithms and methods. These nodes are implemented using PyTorch and have no external dependencies, making them a powerful tool for image processing in the ComfyUI ecosystem."
