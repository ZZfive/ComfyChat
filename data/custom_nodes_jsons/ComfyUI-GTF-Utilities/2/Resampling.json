        "question": "What is Nearest Neighbor?",
        "answer": "Nearest Neighbor is one of the supported resampling algorithms in ComfyUI-GTF-Utilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm?",
        "answer": "The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used for image resampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Lanczos algorithm work?",
        "answer": "Lanczos filtering takes a `radius` parameter, which determines the 'radius' of the filter used. The algorithm adds further 'support' as it smoothly tapers off at a distance specified by the radius."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended radius value for Mitchell-Netravali filters?",
        "answer": "The recommended radius values for Mitchell-Netravali filters are 0.33 and 0.33."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mitchell-Netravali algorithm?",
        "answer": "The Mitchell-Netravali algorithm is used for image resampling, with the ability to change the parameters `b` and `c` to adjust the filter effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported resampling algorithms in ComfyUI-GTF-Utilities?",
        "answer": "The supported resampling algorithms in ComfyUI-GTF-Utilities are: Nearest Neighbor, Triangle (Bilinear), Mitchell-Netravali (Bicubic), Lanczos, and Area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Triangle (BILINEAR) algorithm?",
        "answer": "The Triangle (BILINEAR) algorithm is used for image resampling. It takes a `radius` parameter which determines the 'radius' of the triangle used. A radius of 1 applied seperably will provide standard bilinear filtering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Area algorithm?",
        "answer": "The Area algorithm is used for image resampling."

    },
    {
        "question": "How do Mitchell-Netravali filters work?",
        "answer": "Mitchell-Netravali filters are parameterized by two values: `b` and `c`, but have a fixed radius. Increasing these parameters generally leads to an increase in filter support but at the cost of reduced sharpness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Area algorithm?",
        "answer": "The Area algorithm is used for image resampling."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the Algorithms in ComfyUI-GTF-Utilities?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the algorithms in ComfyUI-GTF-Utilities is to provide full access to all filter parameters and to handle image resampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Nearest Neighbor algorithm parameters?",
        "answer": "The Nearest Neighbor algorithm takes images or latents as input, along with the width and height of the resampled images."
