        "question": "What does the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node serve?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node serves the purpose of enhancing any prompt running the inference of an LLM model on the serverless endpoint on Hugging Face."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node handle inputs?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node takes in inputs such as an HF token, an endpoint ID hosted on Hugging Face, a question for which the user wants an answer, and a context which is an LLM instruction for the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output provided by the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node is a string response which is the result of passing the input question through an LLM model on the serverless endpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node deal with the HF token?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node utilizes the HF token, which is a string representing authentication credentials, to ensure that the user is authorized to use their endpoint on Hugging Face. This is essential for the security and integrity of the model's responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations of the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node has a limitation: it supports models with a size of 10GB or less and can fail for unknown reasons when working with certain models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the process for pairing the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node with a serverless endpoint on Hugging Face?",
        "answer": "To pair the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node with a serverless endpoint on Hugging Face, users need to follow these steps:\n1. Clone the repository for the specific ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node and install the dependencies.\n2. Create a new token in their Hugging Face account for authentication.\n3. Input the token, endpoint ID, question, and context into the nodes to generate the model's response."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do users support the development of the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node?",
        "answer": "Users can support the development of the ComfyUI_HF_Servelress_Inference node by becoming a sponsor. This helps ensure the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the node and related projects."
