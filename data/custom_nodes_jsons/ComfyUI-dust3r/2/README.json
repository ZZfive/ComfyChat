        "question": "What is the purpose of the instructions provided?",
        "answer": "The instructions allow generating pre-training image pairs from the Habitat simulator for the ComfyUI-dust3r project."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the Habitat-Sim scenes be downloaded from?",
        "answer": "The download links for Habitat-Sim scenes can be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/main/DATASETS.md."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be the structure of the scene datasets directory?",
        "answer": "The scene datasets should be placed under ./data/habitat-sim-data/scene_datasets/ with subdirectories for each dataset like hm3d, gibson, habitat-test-scenes, replica_cad_baked_lighting, replica_cad, ReplicaDataset, and scannet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the specifications for the generated image pairs?",
        "answer": "The image pairs should have a resolution of 256x256, a 60-degree field of view, and up to 1000 image pairs per scene."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many image pairs were generated for the Scannet dataset?",
        "answer": "For the Scannet dataset, 1097 scenes were considered, and 985,209 image pairs were generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which datasets were used for pre-training and which were kept for validation?",
        "answer": "The hm3d/train dataset was used for pre-training, while hm3d/val and hm3d/minival pairs were kept for validation purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the image pairs be generated from the metadata?",
        "answer": "To generate image pairs from metadata, use the command: python datasets/habitat_sim/generate_from_metadata_files.py --input_dir=$METADATA_DIR --output_dir=$PAIRS_DATASET_DIR, and then launch multiple commands in parallel using GNU Parallel."
