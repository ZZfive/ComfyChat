        "question": "What are the specific functions contained in COUNTLESS?",
        "answer": "The COUNTLESS package offers multiple functions like texture remapping, foveation, upsampling, whitening, and centering techniques similar to CLARA and All Snippet CEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do we need COUNTLESS?",
        "answer": "COUNTLESS offers an option to perform additional data transformation to handle heterogeneous documents and mitigate their effects. However, not every data transformation is useful for the downstream model, and it introduces additional transformation steps that could complicate the training and inference process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What makes COUNTLESS unique compared to other data transformation methods?",
        "answer": "COUNTLESS differs from other methods as a large pretrained language model is used to sample deeper transformation functions rather than using handcrafted models."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can COUNTLESS be used for unsupervised data transformation?",
        "answer": "Since COUNTLESS uses a pre-trained language model, it is being trained automatically for data transformation tasks. The fusion module of COUNTLESS supports all supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, and the pretrained language model can be utilized to help dynamically adapt the data transformation."
