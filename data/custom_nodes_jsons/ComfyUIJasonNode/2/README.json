        "question": "What is SDXLMixSampler in ComfyUI Jason Node?",
        "answer": "SDXLMixSampler is a custom node in ComfyUI Jason Node that combines base and refiner models into a single node, allowing for a more streamlined sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the total_steps parameter work in SDXLMixSampler?",
        "answer": "In SDXLMixSampler, the total_steps parameter determines the total number of steps the sampler will run, with a default value of 20."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mixing_steps parameter control in SDXLMixSampler?",
        "answer": "The mixing_steps parameter in SDXLMixSampler controls the total number of steps in each loop, where loop = total_steps / mixing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the base_steps_percentage parameter used in SDXLMixSampler?",
        "answer": "The base_steps_percentage parameter in SDXLMixSampler determines the percentage of steps allocated to the base model in each loop, while the refiner model takes the remaining steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why was SDXLMixSampler created?",
        "answer": "SDXLMixSampler was created to facilitate generating text using multiple loops of the base+refiner process within a single node, as it was found to be helpful in text generation."
