        "question": "What is the function of the PlusMinusTextClip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PlusMinusTextClip node adds both the positive and negative prompts as input in one node, eliminating the need for two separate nodes for positive and negative prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I add the PlusMinusTextClip node to my ComfyUI app?",
        "answer": "To add the PlusMinusTextClip node, you need to clone the git repository in the `custom_nodes` folder using the command `git clone https://github.com/shobhitic/ComfyUI-PlusMinusTextClip.git`. After cloning is complete, restart the ComfyUI app, and you will have the option to add this node by searching for `PlusMinusTextClip` after double-clicking on empty space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the visualization of the PlusMinusTextClip node?",
        "answer": "The PlusMinusTextClip node's visualization is not provided here, but it includes input ports for the positive and negative prompts and an output port."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I resolve any issues with the PlusMinusTextClip node?",
        "answer": "Any issues with the PlusMinusTextClip node can be resolved by reporting them on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default name of the PlusMinusTextClip node?",
        "answer": "The default name for the PlusMinusTextClip node is not mentioned in the provided document content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What version of ComfyUI is compatible with the PlusMinusTextClip node?",
        "answer": "The provided document content does not specify the compatible version of ComfyUI for the PlusMinusTextClip node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the variation_seed and seed parameters in the cg-noise node?",
        "answer": "The variation_seed and seed parameters in the cg-noise node are used for generating noise variations. variation_seed is used in the formula `random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)` while the seed determines the base noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can we modify the PlusMinusTextClip node to output boolean results?",
        "answer": "The provided document content does not mention the capability or possibility of modifying the PlusMinusTextClip node to output boolean results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input parameters for the cg-noise node?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise node takes two input parameters: variation_seed and seed. The variation_seed influences the noise, affecting the choice between the original noise and the same noise minus the x portion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What makes the PlusMinusTextClip node stand out from other nodes in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PlusMinusTextClip node simplifies prompt processing, offering functionality from two nodes bundled into one. This can save the user time, space, and effort."
