        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComfyUI_merge ASVL node?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_merge ASVL node is used to connect images. It allows users to combine two or more images, depending on the specified option (vertical or horizontal assignment rule)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node support image connection?",
        "answer": "The ComftyUI_merge ASVL node supports image connection by allowing users to select either a vertical or horizontal assignment rule."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node have a limitation on the number of images it can connect?",
        "answer": "The ComftyUI_merge ASVL node can connect two images at a time but can be used repeatedly to connect multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported image size conditions for the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node?",
        "answer": "The ComftyUI_merge ASVL node supports connecting images that have the same size since it uses the vertical and horizontal assignment rules based on the size consistency."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a user specify the type of connection for images using the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node?",
        "answer": "Users can specify the type of connection for images using the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node by selecting either horizontal or vertical assignment rule in the parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can a user manually input images' horizontal position in the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node?",
        "answer": "The ComftyUI_merge ASVL node does not support manual input of images' horizontal position. The node uses the option of filling in a horizontal assignment rule."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the effect of the fill value in the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node.",
        "answer": "The fill value in the ComftyUI_merge ASVL node determines the transparency of custom nodes that extend ComftyUI's functionality. A values of 0 will result in fully opaque nodes, while values outside the range of 0 and 1 won't display any replaces. Values between 0 and 1 will display an irregular shape that typically is opaque more toward the nodes visibility"
