        "question": "Where should the included LoRA be placed for the ComfyUI-DiffusionLight implementation to work?",
        "answer": "The included LoRA should be placed in the ComfyUI/loras folder for the ComfyUI-DiffusionLight implementation to work properly."

    {
        "question": "Is the LoRA used in ComfyUI-DiffusionLight the same as the original diffusers one?",
        "answer": "No, the LoRA used in ComfyUI-DiffusionLight is converted from the original diffusers one, as the original would not work in ComfyUI as it is."
