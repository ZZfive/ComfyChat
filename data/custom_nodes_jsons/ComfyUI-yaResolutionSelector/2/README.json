        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'overextend' option in the yaResolution Selector (Advanced) node?",
        "answer": "The 'overextend' option in the yaResolution Selector (Advanced) node allows the output resolution to be larger than the base resolution while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is useful when using models that can still generate good images at resolutions larger than the base resolution."
