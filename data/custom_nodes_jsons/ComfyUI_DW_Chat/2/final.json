Positive values increase likelihood of talking about new topics and negative or zero values encourage repetition.\n\nThe frequency_penalty parameter is also adjusted from -2.0 to 2.0 and concerns the frequency of new tokens in the text. Positive values reduce the repetition of phrases verbatim and negative or zero values increase the use of common words.\n\nTemperature parameter, from 0 to 2.0 with a default value of 0.7, controls the randomness of the output. Lower temperatures result in more consistent outputs with the model choosing the most likely next word, while higher temperatures increase diversity at the cost of potential incoherence. Setting temperature to 0 makes the model completely deterministic.\n\nThe top_p parameter, from 0 to 1.0 with a default value of 1.0, is used for nuclear sampling. It determines the cumulative probability threshold for the words considered by the model. Lower values make the output more focused and deterministic, while values close to 1 allow for more variety in the output."
