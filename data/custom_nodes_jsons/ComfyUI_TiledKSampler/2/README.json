        "question": "What is ComfyUI_TiledKSampler?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_TiledKSampler is a tiled sampler for ComfyUI that allows denoising larger images by splitting them into smaller tiles and denoising these tiles while minimizing seams in the end result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ComfyUI_TiledKSampler minimize seams in the final image?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_TiledKSampler minimizes seams by gradually denoising all tiles one step at a time and randomizing tile positions for every step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the additional settings available in ComfyUI_TiledKSampler?",
        "answer": "The additional settings in ComfyUI_TiledKSampler include tile_width, tile_height, and tiling_strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which tiling strategy is best for hiding seams in images?",
        "answer": "The random tiling strategy is exceptionally good at hiding seams in images, even when starting from complete noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the downside of the random tiling strategy?",
        "answer": "The downside of the random tiling strategy is that it can unfavorably crop border tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which tiling strategy is compatible with uni samplers and has no overhead between steps?",
        "answer": "The padded tiling strategy is compatible with uni samplers and has no overhead between steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What features are included in the ComfyUI_TiledKSampler roadmap?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI_TiledKSampler roadmap includes features such as latent masks, image-wide control nets, T2I adaptors, area conditioning, area mask conditioning, and GLIGEN."
