        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptJSON node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptJSON node in ComfyUI structures natural language prompts and generates prompts for external LLM nodes in image generation workflows, aiding in creating consistent, schema-based image descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the features of the PromptJSON node?",
        "answer": "The PromptJSON node supports various schema types, multiple prompt generation strategies, negative prompts, adjustable complexity for output detail, and custom schema support for fine-tuning prompt structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the PromptJSON node be installed?",
        "answer": "The PromptJSON node can be installed using the comfy manager 'Install via git' option or by cloning the repository into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory and restarting ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs and outputs of the PromptJSON node?",
        "answer": "The inputs for the PromptJSON node include prompt, negative_prompt, complexity, llm_prompt_type, schema_type, and custom_schema. The outputs are system_prompt, user_prompt, negative_passthru, and schema."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two LLM prompt types supported by PromptJSON?",
        "answer": "The PromptJSON node supports two LLM prompt types: One Shot and Few Shot. One Shot provides a single example of a structured response, while Few Shot provides multiple examples at different complexity levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the schema types available in the PromptJSON node?",
        "answer": "The PromptJSON node supports schema types such as JSON, HTML, Key, Attribute-Based, Visual Layer Breakdown, Compositional Grid, and Artistic Reference."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the custom schema feature work in the PromptJSON node?",
        "answer": "The custom schema feature in the PromptJSON node allows you to define the structure of the output, with the format depending on the chosen schema type, such as JSON."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the complexity parameter in the PromptJSON node?",
        "answer": "The complexity parameter in the PromptJSON node is used to control the level of detail in the generated prompts."
