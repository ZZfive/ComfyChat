        "question": "What does the CountTokens node do?",
        "answer": "The CountTokens node counts the number of tokens in a given text string using the CLIP tokenizer from the transformers library. It's useful for analyzing text complexity and preprocessing text data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the FileCountInDirectory node accomplish?",
        "answer": "The FileCountInDirectory node counts the number of files within a given directory, providing an option to filter by file type. This is useful for managing and analyzing file systems."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the use case for the TrimToTokens node.",
        "answer": "The TrimToTokens node trims a text string to include only a specified number of tokens. This node is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to limit the length of text inputs to certain token thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs for the TokenCountRanker node?",
        "answer": "The TokenCountRanker node takes two inputs: a CLIP model and a Text (String). These inputs are used to sort segments and words within the text string based on their token count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs produced by the FileCountInDirectory node?",
        "answer": "The FileCountInDirectory node outputs the File Count (Integer), which is the total number of files present in the specified directory. An optional input of File Types (String) can be used to filter the file count based on file type."
