        "question": "What is the purpose of the Flux Resolution Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Resolution Calculator node is designed to determine the optimal image resolution for outputs generated using the Flux model. It allows users to input their desired megapixel count and aspect ratio, and calculates the exact image dimensions necessary for optimal performance with the Flux model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the supported megapixel values for the Flux Resolution Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Resolution Calculator node supports the following megapixel values: 0.1 MP, 1.0 MP, 2.0 MP, 2.1 MP, 2.2 MP, 2.3 MP, 2.4MP, 2.5MP."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Flux Sampler node combine?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler node combines the functionality of the CustomSamplerAdvance node and input nodes into a single, streamlined node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default CFG setting for the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The default CFG setting for the Flux Sampler node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of conditioning are supported by the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler node only supports positive conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models are compatible with the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "Only the samplers and schedulers compatible with the Flux model are included in the Flux Sampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Flux Sampler node be combined with the Flux Resolution Calculator node?",
        "answer": "To combine the Flux Sampler node with the Flux Resolution Calculator node, the user must connect the Ratio output of the latter to the custom_aspect_ratio input of the former."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the configuration of the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler node adheres to the following configuration: CFG is set to 1, and only positive conditioning is supported. Furthermore, the node only includes samplers and schedulers that are compatible with the Flux model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the custom_aspect_ratio feature used for?",
        "answer": "The custom_aspect_ratio feature is used to input a custom aspect ratio, which can be enabled or disabled. It allows users to set the desired aspect ratio in the format (e.g., 4:9)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the Flux Sampler node is to combine the functionality of the CustomSamplerAdvance node and input nodes into a single, streamlined node. It aims to provide a unified interface for accessing the advanced sampling capabilities of the Flux model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Flux Sampler node handle the CFG setting?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler node sets the CFG value to 1, which is the default configuration for this node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Get Image Size & Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The Get Image Size & Ratio node is designed to retrieve the image resolution in terms of width, height, and ratio. It can also be further connected to the Flux Resolution Calculator to facilitate tasks involving image resolution scaling and adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the application of the Query node?",
        "answer": "The Query node is used to retrieve information from the FLUX controlnet registry. It can be interacted with using Python's FLUX API."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Apply ControlNet Node?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet Node is a placeholder node designed to be compatible with the Flux Sampler. It serves as a building block for developers looking to incorporate controlnet functionality into their Flux-generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who developed the Flux model series?",
        "answer": "The Flux model series was developed by Black Forest Labs, an AI research organization that specializes in pushing the boundaries of image generation through advanced deep-learning techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations of the Flux Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler node has some limitations. It does not support custom ratios, and it does not include the functionality of the CustomSamplerAdvance node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Flux Sampler Node?",
        "answer": "The Flux Sampler Node is designed to provide advanced sampling functionality for the Flux model. It combines the features of the CustomSamplerAdvance node and input nodes, allowing for efficient and streamlined sampling operations."
