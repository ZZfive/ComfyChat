        "question": "What is the ComfyUI Embedding Picker custom node used for?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI Embedding Picker custom node is used to easily remember and use various embedding names by automatically inserting them into prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available ways to install the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI Embedding Picker can be installed via direct download from the 'Code' button pop-up window or by cloning the repository using `git clone` into the `custom_nodes` directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should the default prompt structure look like when using the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "By default, the prompt structure when using the ComfyUI Embedding Picker looks like `embedding:EasyNegative.pt, text, watermark`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'append' parameter in the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "The 'append' parameter is used to adjust the placement of the embedding in the prompt. Setting it to True will place the embedding at the end of the prompt, forming a structure like `text, watermark, embedding:EasyNegative.pt`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of custom node is the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI Embedding Picker is a custom node designed to extend the functionality of ComfyUI for better embedding management."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you quickly chain multiple embeddings using the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "You can quickly chain multiple embeddings by either selecting the top option 'Prepend Embedding Picker' on the _CLIP Text Encode_ node or by using the similar option available on the `Embedding Picker' node itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between an 'append' value of False and True in the ComfyUI Embedding Picker?",
        "answer": "An 'append' value of False in the ComfyUI Embedding Picker places the embedding at the beginning of the prompt, forming a structure like `embedding:EasyNegative.pt, text, watermark`. On the other hand, an 'append' value of True places the embedding at the end of the prompt, forming a structure like `text, watermark, embedding:EasyNegative.pt`."
