        "question": "What is ComfyUI-seam-carving?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-seam-carving is a custom node for ComfyUI that adds the 'Image Resize (seam carving)' node, which resizes images using the seam carving technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is seam carving?",
        "answer": "Seam carving, also known as liquid rescaling, is a technique for changing image size by adding or removing rows or columns of pixels with the least effect on the resulting image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Image Resize (seam carving)' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the 'Image Resize (seam carving)' node in ComfyUI is to resize images using the seam carving technique, which preserves the most important features of the image while changing its dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does seam carving differ from regular image resizing methods?",
        "answer": "Seam carving differs from regular image resizing methods by selectively adding or removing pixels based on their importance to the overall image, rather than simply scaling the image uniformly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What library does ComfyUI-seam-carving use for its implementation?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-seam-carving uses the 'https://github.com/li-plus/seam-carving' library for its implementation of the seam carving technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can seam carving be slow in certain situations?",
        "answer": "Yes, seam carving can be very slow if adding or removing many pixels from the image. To mitigate this, it is recommended to resize the image closer to the target size using regular methods before applying seam carving."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the alternative names for seam carving?",
        "answer": "Seam carving is also known as liquid rescaling."
