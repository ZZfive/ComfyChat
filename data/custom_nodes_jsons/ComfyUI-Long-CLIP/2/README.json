        "question": "What is ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Long-CLIP is a project that implements the comfyui for long-clip, allowing the replacement of clip-l in Stable Diffusion models to expand the token length."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Stable Diffusion models are currently supported by ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Long-CLIP currently supports Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5) and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) models."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ComfyUI-Long-CLIP improve the quality of generated images?",
        "answer": "By replacing the original clip in the model and expanding the token length from 77 to 248, ComfyUI-Long-CLIP improves the quality of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the procedure for processing smaller tokens in the SDXL model using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
        "answer": "For smaller tokens in the SDXL model, ComfyUI-Long-CLIP expands them by an integer multiple of the original max_len and trims the excess part since the last added are pad_tokens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected result when using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP with the SDXL model?",
        "answer": "When using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP with the SDXL model, you may notice more detailed images due to the larger proportion of clip-g features in SDXL."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I start using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
        "answer": "To start using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP, clone the ComfyUI repository and the ComfyUI-Long-CLIP custom node, then download the LongCLIP-L weights and place them in the models/checkpoints folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are there any examples available for using ComfyUI-Long-CLIP with SD1.5 and SDXL models?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ComfyUI-Long-CLIP project provides specific examples for both SD1.5 and SDXL models, making it easy to use without installing any additional plugins."
