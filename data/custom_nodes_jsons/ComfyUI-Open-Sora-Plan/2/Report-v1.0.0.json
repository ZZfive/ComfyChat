        "question": "What is the goal of the Open-Sora-Plan?",
        "answer": "The goal of the Open-Sora-Plan is to reproduce the OpenAI Sora through an open-source framework, enabling training of video generation models, including Unconditioned Video Generation, Class Video Generation, and Text-to-Video Generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key improvements in Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0 compared to previous video generation models?",
        "answer": "Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0 introduces several improvements such as efficient training and inference with CausalVideoVAE, and joint image-video training for better quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What components are made publicly available as part of the Open-Sora-Plan open-source release?",
        "answer": "The open-source release of Open-Sora-Plan includes a Hugging Face demo, all training scripts and sample scripts, both Diffusion Model and CausalVideoVAE, and both raw videos and captions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CausalVideoVAE architecture ensure seamless application of pretrained weights from the Image VAE to the Video VAE?",
        "answer": "The CausalVideoVAE architecture ensures seamless application of pretrained weights from the Image VAE to the Video VAE by converting Conv2D to CausalConv3D, enabling joint training of image and video data, and by employing a specific initialization method (tail initialization)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two main drawbacks of the current released version of CausalVideoVAE (v1.0.0)?",
        "answer": "The two main drawbacks of the current released version of CausalVideoVAE (v1.0.0) are motion blurring and gridding effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Open-Sora-Plan team plan to address the issue of limited video domain generation capability in their dataset?",
        "answer": "The Open-Sora-Plan team plans to continue collecting high-quality datasets and also welcomes recommendations from the open-source community to address the issue of limited video domain generation capability in their dataset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the three main aspects the Open-Sora-Plan team will focus on in their upcoming work to further improve the model?",
        "answer": "In their upcoming work, the Open-Sora-Plan team will focus on training support for dynamic resolution and duration, support for longer video generation, and enhanced conditional control."
