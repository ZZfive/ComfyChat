        "question": "What is ComfyUI-AudioScheduler?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-AudioScheduler is a collection of audio processing nodes that are part of the AudioScheduler project. These nodes can be used to perform various operations on audio data, such as loading audio, performing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and manipulating amplitude data to control animations in AI generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you install ComfyUI-AudioScheduler?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-AudioScheduler can be installed using the ComfyUI Manager by looking for 'ComfyUI-AudioScheduler'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the AudioToAudioData node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler do?",
        "answer": "The AudioToAudioData node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler is responsible for loading audio files. It supports both MP3 and WAV formats and returns the loaded audio data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can be performed using the BatchAmplitudeSchedule node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler?",
        "answer": "The BatchAmplitudeSchedule node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler calculates amplitude values from FFT data based on the specified operation (avg, max, sum) and frequency range. You can select different frequency ranges with the lower and upper band ranges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ClipAmplitude node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler work?",
        "answer": "The ClipAmplitude node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler is used to clip the amplitude values of audio data. You can specify the maximum and optional minimum allowed amplitude values. Any amplitude values exceeding the specified range will be clipped to the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the NormalizedAmplitudeDrivenString node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler?",
        "answer": "The NormalizedAmplitudeDrivenString node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler is designed for generating text prompts based on audio amplitude data. This node allows you to create a dynamic string of text driven by changes in the normalized amplitude of audio signals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the NormalizedAmplitudeToGraph node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler do?",
        "answer": "The NormalizedAmplitudeToGraph node in ComfyUI-AudioScheduler generates a graph to visualize the normalized amplitude data."
