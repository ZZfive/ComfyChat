The scorer is based on the [MLP class code](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor) from Christoph Schuhmann and is repurposed from the [strimmlarn](https://github.com/strimmlarn/ComfyUI-Strimmlarns-Aesthetic-Score) custom nodes.\n- Image Reward: This node outputs a predicted aesthetic score as a number and displays it with the appropriate node. The scorer is based on the [ImageReward](https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward) model and uses 137K input samples that were scored by humans.\n\nBoth nodes add about 7-10 seconds to a workflow on the author's Nvidia 3060 12 GB card, but they often score differently, leading to interesting discussions about the quality of the generated images."
