        "question": "How is image equality checked in 'KLoadImageDedup'?",
        "answer": "Image equality in 'KLoadImageDedup' is checked by first verifying if images with the same name already exist in the input image list, considering variations in file names generated automatically by ComfyUI in case of name conflicts. Then, it compares the hashes of those images with the hash of the new input image."

        "question": "Describe the functionality of a 'KLoadImageByPathAdvanced'.",
        "answer": "KLoadImageByPathAdvanced is a custom node in ComfyUI that extends the functionality of KLoadImageByPath. It allows for additional customization in image loading processes, specifically it allows the substitution of a prefix in the input path. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the local file system path needs to be adjusted to match the local server filesystem, thus eliminating the need for manual path replacement."
