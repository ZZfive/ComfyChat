        "question": "What is Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model that allows billions of people to create stunning art within seconds. It is a breakthrough in speed and quality and can run on consumer GPUs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the available pipelines in Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "Some of the available pipelines in Stable Diffusion include pipeline_stable_diffusion.py for Text-to-Image Generation, pipeline_stable_diffusion_img2img for Image-to-Image Text-Guided Generation, and pipeline_stable_diffusion_inpaint for Text-Guided Image Inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use Stable Diffusion without being logged into the Hub?",
        "answer": "To use Stable Diffusion without being logged into the Hub, you can download the weights to a local path using 'git lfs install' and 'git clone https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5', and then pass the local path to 'from_pretrained'."

    {
        "question": "What is the default scheduler used in the Text-to-Image example?",
        "answer": "In the Text-to-Image example, the default scheduler used is the PLMS scheduler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the scheduler used in the CycleDiffusion example?",
        "answer": "In the CycleDiffusion example, the scheduler used is the DDIM scheduler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the parameters passed to the CycleDiffusion pipeline in the example?",
        "answer": "The parameters passed to the CycleDiffusion pipeline in the example include prompt, source_prompt, image, num_inference_steps, eta, strength, guidance_scale, and source_guidance_scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the source_prompt and prompt parameters in the CycleDiffusion pipeline?",
        "answer": "In the CycleDiffusion pipeline, the source_prompt parameter is the initial prompt or description of the source image, while the prompt parameter is the target prompt or description of the desired output image."
