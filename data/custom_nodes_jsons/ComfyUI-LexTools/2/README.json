        "question": "What is ComfyUI-LexTools?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-LexTools is a Python-based image processing and analysis toolkit that uses machine learning models for semantic image segmentation, image scoring, and image captioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the primary components of ComfyUI-LexTools?",
        "answer": "The primary components of ComfyUI-LexTools are ImageProcessingNode.py, ImageCaptioningNode.py, and SegformerNode.py."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageAspectPadNode do?",
        "answer": "The ImageAspectPadNode in ComfyUI-LexTools expands the image to meet a specific aspect ratio. It is useful for maintaining the aspect ratio when processing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the ImageScaleToMin node?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleToMin node calculates the value needed to rescale an image's smallest dimension to 512. It is useful for scaling images down to 512 or up to 512 for faster processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageQualityScoreNode work?",
        "answer": "The ImageQualityScoreNode calculates a quality score for the image based on various parameters such as aesthetic score, image score good, image score bad, AI score artificial, AI score human, and more."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageCaptioningNode?",
        "answer": "The ImageCaptioningNode in ComfyUI-LexTools provides a caption for the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SegformerNode do?",
        "answer": "The SegformerNode in ComfyUI-LexTools performs segmentation of the image. It takes an image and a model name as input and outputs a segmented image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the libraries required by ComfyUI-LexTools?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-LexTools requires Python, Torch, Transformers, PIL, Matplotlib, Numpy, IO, and Scipy libraries."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can someone contribute to the ComfyUI-LexTools project?",
        "answer": "Contributions to the ComfyUI-LexTools project are welcome. If you find a bug or think of a feature that would benefit the project, please open an issue. If you'd like to contribute code, please open a pull request."
