        "question": "What is PowerNoiseSuite?",
        "answer": "Power Noise Suite is a collection of nodes for ComfyUI that focus on latent noise input, diffusion, and latent adjustments. It is the successor to PPF_Noise_ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is new in PowerNoiseSuite compared to PPF_Noise_ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PowerNoiseSuite has overhauled Power-Law Noise for more accurate noise representation and introduced a Tonal Guide Image in the Power KSampler to help tone generations similar to an input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tonal Guide Image in Power KSampler?",
        "answer": "The Tonal Guide Image in Power KSampler can be used to help tone a generation similar to an input image. While not always reliable, it can theme the generation very much like the input image in some instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should the PowerNoiseSuite repository be installed?",
        "answer": "The PowerNoiseSuite repository should be cloned to the 'ComfyUI/custom_nodes' directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of noise can be generated using the Power Law Noise node?",
        "answer": "The Power Law Noise node can generate various types of power-law noise, including white, grey, pink, green, blue, and mix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Adjustment node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Adjustment node allows adjusting latents, such as brightness, contrast, and sharpness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Power KSampler Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The Power KSampler Advanced node provides advanced capabilities for noise sampling in ComfyUI. It works with samplers that inject noise on every step and utilize the comfy.k_diffusion.sampling.default_noise_sampler() method."
