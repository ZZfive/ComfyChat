        "question": "What does ComfyUI-IMG_Query do?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-IMG_Query is used for image query in ComfyUI, leveraging the powerful functionality of HED-Query, which can process large images quickly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ComfyUI-IMG_Query improve processing speed for users?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-IMG_Query blocks HED-Query for large images, meaning that only small images are processed by HED-Query, significantly improving the processing speed for users."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain how ComfyUI-IMG_Query simplifies data naming in ComfyTP?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-IMG_Query uses the same naming system in ComfyTP for data ownership, simplifying data naming and organization within ComfyTP."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is importance sampling implemented in ComfyUI-IMG_Query?",
        "answer": "Importance sampling is implemented using the K-Nearest Neighbors method, which can be used as an approximation method to F-Style Comisons for obtaining samples easily."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the algorithm interact with user-provided models via Python?",
        "answer": "As of now, the algorithm does not interact directly with user-provided models via Python. Such functionality might require additional implementation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific model does ComfyUI-IMG_Query use for its queries?",
        "answer": "For now, the specific model used in ComfyUI-IMG_Query is defined as a standard Gumbel model which is available via `torch.distributions`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does ComfyUI-IMG_Query have the ability to use a direct input of pixel values for its queries?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-IMG_Query currently lacks the ability to directly use pixel values for its queries and is thus designed to process images rather than pixel values directly."
