        "question": "What is the purpose of the experimental custom nodes in ComfyUI_experiments?",
        "answer": "The experimental custom nodes in ComfyUI_experiments provide additional functionality and features for ComfyUI, such as tonemapping algorithms, rescaling Classifier-Free Guidance, model merging, and a reference only controlnet."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I use the experimental custom nodes in my ComfyUI setup?",
        "answer": "To use the experimental custom nodes, you need to copy the .py files to your custom_nodes directory. They will show up in the custom_node_experiments/ folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node in sampler_tonemap.py do?",
        "answer": "The ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest node in sampler_tonemap.py applies a simple tonemapping algorithm to the noise used by the sampler. This allows using higher CFG values without breaking the image. To use higher CFG, you can lower the multiplier value."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node implements the Rescale Classifier-Free Guidance technique?",
        "answer": "The node that implements the Rescale Classifier-Free Guidance technique is located in the sampler_rescalecfg.py file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the advanced_model_merging.py file?",
        "answer": "The advanced_model_merging.py file contains a node for merging models by block."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used for merging SDXL base models?",
        "answer": "The node for merging SDXL base models is located in the sdxl_model_merging.py file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the reference_only.py file contain?",
        "answer": "The reference_only.py file contains a node that implements the 'reference only controlnet'. An example workflow for this node can be found in the workflows folder."
