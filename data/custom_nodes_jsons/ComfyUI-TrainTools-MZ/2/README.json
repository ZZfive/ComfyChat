    {
        "question": "How can the SD-XL 1.0-base model be used with the Diffusers library?",
        "answer": "To use the SD-XL 1.0-base model with the Diffusers library, you need to upgrade diffusers to >= 0.19.0, install transformers, safetensors, accelerate and the invisible watermark, and then run the provided code snippet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the license for the SD-XL 1.0-base model?",
        "answer": "The SD-XL 1.0-base model is licensed under the CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SD-XL 1.0-base model compare to previous Stable Diffusion models?",
        "answer": "The SD-XL 1.0-base model performs significantly better than previous variants like Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 2.1, and the model combined with the refinement module achieves the best overall performance."
