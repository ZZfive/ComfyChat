        "question": "What is SD-XL?",
        "answer": "SD-XL is an ensemble of experts pipeline for latent diffusion, consisting of a base model for generating noisy latents, and a refinement model specialized for final denoising steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SD-XL refiner model differ from the base model?",
        "answer": "The refiner model further processes the latents generated by the base model to achieve better final denoising results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using SD-XL?",
        "answer": "SD-XL offers significant improvements over previous variants in user preference and overall performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which research areas can SD-XL be applied?",
        "answer": "Research areas include generation of artworks, educational and creative tools, research on generative models, etc."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some limitations and biases of SD-XL?",
        "answer": "Limitations include lack of perfect photorealism, inability to render legible text, struggle with compositionality tasks, issues with generating faces and people, and lossy autoencoding."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can SD-XL be used for factual or true representation generation?",
        "answer": "No, SD-XL is not trained for generating factual or true representations of people or events."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some potential out-of-scope uses of SD-XL?",
