        "question": "What does the acronym 'GLSL' stand for?",
        "answer": "GLSL stands for 'Graphics Library Shader Language'. It is a language for creating shaders used in 3D graphics applications, including computer-generated imagery (CGI) and video game graphics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the nodes 'glslEditor', 'glslViewer', and 'glslCanvas' added by the nodes?",
        "answer": "The nodes 'glslEditor', 'glslViewer', and 'glslCanvas' are added to support GLSL shaders on workflows. Specifically, 'glslEditor' is used for editing GLSL source code, 'glslViewer' is used for visualizing the effects of GLSL shaders, and 'glslCanvas' is used for showing the rendered results of GLSL shaders in a canvas."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of data can be read by the provided nodes?",
        "answer": "The provided nodes can read multiple textures and texturesArrays, which are typically used for storing images that will be manipulated by the shader code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the features of the code that are compatible with GlslViewer, Glsl-Pipeline, and GlslCanvas?",
        "answer": "The code is compatible with GlslViewer, Glsl-Pipeline, and GlslCanvas if it follows the following specs: Uniforms, which define the inputs and outputs of the shader, and Defines, which specify the defines needed for the shader to work properly, following the specs provided by GlslViewer. Additionally, the code contains the LYGIA Shader Library by resolving all `#include` directives from LYGIA's Server."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some examples of uses of the provided nodes?",
        "answer": "Some examples of uses of the provided nodes include generating types.json, depth_of_field.json, edge_detection.json, look_up_table.json, raymarch_to_image.json, raymarch_buffers.json, video_flow.json, video_mask.json, video_dither.json, video_pixelate.json, shadertoy.json, and more."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the OPTICAL_FLOW and MASK textures provided by the nodes?",
        "answer": "The OPTICAL_FLOW and MASK textures are used for generating optical flow and creating surface detail on other channels, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the remaining features on the roadmap that have not been completed?",
        "answer": "The remaining features that have not been completed on the roadmap include loading 3D geometry, vertex shaders, cubeMaps, background pass, postprocessing pass, and scene pass."
