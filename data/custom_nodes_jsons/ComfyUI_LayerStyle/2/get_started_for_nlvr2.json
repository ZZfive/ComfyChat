        "question": "What is the purpose of fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "The purpose of fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2 is to improve its performance on visual reasoning tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the steps to set up the environment for fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "The steps to set up the environment include setting up the environment according to the README, cloning the nlvr repository, signing the request form to download the images, and organizing the dataset in the specified structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the effective batch size calculated when fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "The effective batch size is calculated by multiplying the number of GPUs, the batch size per GPU, and the update frequency. For example, with 8 GPUs and a batch size of 32, the effective batch size is 8 * 32 = 256."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `--enable_deepspeed` flag when fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "The `--enable_deepspeed` flag is optional and should be enabled if using apex for fine-tuning BEiT-3 on NLVR2."

    {
        "question": "What is the recommended learning rate for fine-tuning BEiT-3 base and large models on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "The recommended learning rate is 7e-4 for BEiT-3 base model and 3e-4 for BEiT-3 large model when fine-tuning on NLVR2."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the GPU memory be saved when fine-tuning the BEiT-3 large model on NLVR2?",
        "answer": "GPU memory can be saved by using gradient checkpointing with the `--checkpoint_activations` flag when fine-tuning the BEiT-3 large model on NLVR2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the expected accuracy results for the fine-tuned BEiT-3 base and large models on NLVR2 test set?",
        "answer": "The expected accuracy results are 84.386% for the fine-tuned BEiT-3 base model and 89.437% for the fine-tuned BEiT-3 large model on the NLVR2 test set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What command is used to evaluate the fine-tuned BEiT-3 models on the NLVR2 test set?",
        "answer": "The command used to evaluate the fine-tuned BEiT-3 models on the NLVR2 test set is `python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 run_beit3_finetuning.py` with the appropriate arguments."
