        "question": "What does the Depth2Mask node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Depth2Mask node in ComfyUI turns depth into a mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Depth2Mask node?",
        "answer": "The primary purpose of the Depth2Mask node is to convert depth information into a mask, which can be used in various visualization and image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input for the Depth2Mask node?",
        "answer": "TheDepth2Mask node takes depth data as its input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Depth2Mask node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Depth2Mask node is a mask generated from the depth data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Depth2Mask node be used in Inpainting workflows?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Depth2Mask node can also be used in Depth2Mask_Inpainting workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find the Depth2Mask_Inpainting JSON file?",
        "answer": "You can find the Depth2Mask_Inpainting JSON file at this link: [depth2mask_inpainting.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15702726/depth2mask_inpainting.json)"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between Depth2Mask and Depth2Mask_Inpainting?",
        "answer": "Depth2Mask is designed for generating masks from depth data, while Depth2Mask_Inpainting utilizes this mask in an Inpainting workflow, thereby filling in missing or damaged areas in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Depth2Mask node be used for any other purposes?",
        "answer": "While the primary usage is for generating masks,Depth2Mask can potentially be adapted or used in various other applications that require mask generation from depth information."
    },
    {
        "question": "How complex is the Depth2Mask node?",
        "answer": "The complexity of the Depth2Mask node would depend on its implementation details within the ComfyUI framework. However, considering it's a custom node, it is likely to have a moderate level of complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why would someone want to use Depth2Mask-Inpainting instead of Depth2Mask?",
        "answer": "Depth2Mask-Inpainting can be useful when you need to not just generate a mask but also perform Inpainting on an image. It provides a more complete workflow by handling both mask generation and image restoration."
