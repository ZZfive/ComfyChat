        "question": "What is Skimmed_CFG?",
        "answer": "Skimmed_CFG is a powerful anti-burn custom node for latent diffusion models in ComfyUI that allows much higher CFG scales."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different nodes available in Skimmed_CFG?",
        "answer": "The nodes in Skimmed_CFG include: Skimmed CFG, Skimmed CFG - replace, Skimmed CFG - linear interpolation, Skimmed CFG - linear interpolation dual scales, and Skimmed CFG - Difference CFG."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the special option available only in the first node of Skimmed_CFG?",
        "answer": "The special option available only in the first node of Skimmed_CFG is full_skim_negative, which fully skims some part of the conflicting influence."
    },
    {
