    {
        "question": "What does the EGIPAdapter-Mad-Assistant node do?",
        "answer": "The EGIPAdapter-Mad-Assistant node allows quick adjustment of injection weights for layers 0-10 in a slider style, to achieve different results of IPAdapter style transfer. It has 0 to 10 layers with weights ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between EGIPAdapter-Mad-Assistant and EGIPAdapter-Mad-AssistantV2 nodes?",
        "answer": "The EGIPAdapter-Mad-Assistant node has 0 to 10 layers with weights ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, while the EGIPAdapter-Mad-AssistantV2 node has 0 to 10 layers with weights ranging from -1.0 to 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the ComfUI-EGAdapterMadAssistant node be found after installation?",
        "answer": "After installation, the ComfUI-EGAdapterMadAssistant node can be found directly in IPAdapter, and the node name is EGIPAdapter-Mad-Assistant."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the Random setting is set to 'no' in the normal mode of ComfUI-EGAdapterMadAssistant?",
        "answer": "When the Random setting is set to 'no' in the normal mode, the node outputs the corresponding layer according to manual slider weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the Random setting is set to 'yes' in the random mode of ComfUI-EGAdapterMadAssistant?",
        "answer": "When the Random setting is set to 'yes' in the random mode, the output of the corresponding layer will be based on the manual slider weight, and only the weight of non-zero weights will be randomly assigned to 0-1. The layers with manually set weights will maintain their set weight."
