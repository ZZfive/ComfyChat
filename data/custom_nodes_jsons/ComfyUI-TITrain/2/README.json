        "question": "What is the purpose of the ComfyUI-TITrain custom node?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-TITrain custom node allows users to train textual inversion embeddings directly from the ComfyUI pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you install the ComfyUI-TITrain custom node?",
        "answer": "To install the ComfyUI-TITrain custom node, you need to follow the installation instructions provided in the diffusers repository, clone the ComfyUI-TITrain repository inside the custom_nodes directory, install the requirements, and then restart and refresh ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "Which model is the 'Textual Inversion Training SD1.5' node designed to train?",
        "answer": "The 'Textual Inversion Training SD1.5' node is designed to train the Stable Diffusion 1.5 encoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'train_dir' parameter in the ComfyUI-TITrain node?",
        "answer": "The 'train_dir' parameter specifies the directory where the input images for training will be stored. If the specified directory doesn't exist in 'ComfyUI/output/', it will be created."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'extra_prompts' parameter in the ComfyUI-TITrain node?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_prompts' parameter allows users to add additional prompts, with each line containing a prompt that will be randomly selected and appended to the final prompt during training. This is useful for adding prompt parts that should not be considered part of the embedding itself, such as 'white background', 'close up', or 'tattoo'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can you find explanations for the other parameters used in the ComfyUI-TITrain node?",
        "answer": "Explanations for the other parameters used in the ComfyUI-TITrain node can be found in the diffusers repository on GitHub."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there a progress bar available when training the SD 1.5 encoder using the ComfyUI-TITrain node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'Textual Inversion Training SD1.5' node includes a progress bar to track the training progress."
