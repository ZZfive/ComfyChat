        "question": "What is ComfyUI-NegiTools?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-NegiTools is a set of tools and custom nodes that extend the functionality of ComfyUI, a GUI that uses a stable diffusion model to generate images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI replaces KSampler and KSampler Advanced, allowing for small variations in the initial noise by using a weight 'x' and two seeds."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the cg-noise custom node generate variations in images?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise custom node generates variations in images by using the formula 'random_based_on(variation_seed) * x + random_based_on(seed) * (1-x)' to create noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some potential issues that may arise when using the cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "One potential issue with using the cg-noise custom node is that it may not be compatible with all configurations of ComfyUI, and may require additional setup or troubleshooting to work properly."
    },

        "answer": "Yes, the cg-noise custom node can be used in conjunction with other custom nodes or plugins in ComfyUI to create more complex image and video generation pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the cg-noise custom node a standalone tool or does it require ComfyUI to function?",
        "answer": "The cg-noise custom node is not a standalone tool and requires ComfyUI to function properly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are there any limitations to the types of images or videos that can be generated using the cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The types of images or videos that can be generated using the cg-noise custom node in ComfyUI may be limited by the capabilities of the stable diffusion model and the specific configuration of the node and other settings in ComfyUI."
