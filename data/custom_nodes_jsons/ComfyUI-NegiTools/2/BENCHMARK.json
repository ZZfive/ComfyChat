        "question": "What is the purpose of running benchmarks for different models in ComfyUI-NegiTools?",
        "answer": "The benchmarks are run to compare the performance of different models in terms of milliseconds per iteration, time and FLOP per operator type, and memory usage for features and parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many models were benchmarked in the given context?",
        "answer": "A total of 8 models were benchmarked: EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, EfficientNet-B2, MixNet-M, TF MobileNet-V3 Large 1.0, MobileNet-V3 (RW), MnasNet-A1, and MnasNet-B1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the percentage of time spent on the Conv operator for the optimized MobileNet-V3 (RW) model?",
        "answer": "For the optimized MobileNet-V3 (RW) model, 78.8965% of the time is spent on the Conv operator."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the benchmarks compare between the unoptimized and optimized versions of a model?",
        "answer": "The optimized versions of the models generally show improved performance in terms of reduced milliseconds per iteration and changes in the distribution of time and memory usage across different operator types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the total parameter memory for the unoptimized MnasNet-B1 model?",
        "answer": "The total parameter memory for the unoptimized MnasNet-B1 model is 17.5332 MB."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model has the highest FLOP per operator type for the Conv operator?",
        "answer": "The EfficientNet-B2 model has the highest FLOP for the Conv operator at 1.98431 GFLOP."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the feature memory read for the Mul operator compare between the unoptimized and optimized versions of the MnasNet-A1 model?",
        "answer": "In the unoptimized version of MnasNet-A1, the feature memory read for the Mul operator is 14.5035 MB, while in the optimized version it is not explicitly listed."
