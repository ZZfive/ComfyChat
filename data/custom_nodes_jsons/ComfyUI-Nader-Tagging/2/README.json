        "question": "What does the Tag Alternating Combiner node do?",
        "answer": "The Tag Alternating Combiner node takes input from multiple fields and rounds robin them according to their ratio. For instance, if Field 1 has 20 tags and Field 2 has 5 tags, 4 tags are taken from Field 1, then 1 tag taken from Field 2, and this pattern is repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tag Duplicates Remover node?",
        "answer": "The Tag Duplicates Remover node removes duplicate tags from the input, keeping only the first instance of each tag."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Split Tags / Split Sentences node operate?",
        "answer": "The Split Tags / Split Sentences node splits a field of tags into two sets based on the defined maximum number before splitting. It also has a version for splitting sentences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TokenCounter node calculate?",
        "answer": "The TokenCounter node counts the number of tokens (words) in a given field."

        "question": "What are the key features of the ComfyUI-Nader-Tagging set of nodes?",
        "answer": "The key features of the ComfyUI-Nader-Tagging set of nodes include:\n1. Tag Alternating Combiner: Rounds robin tags from multiple fields based on their ratio.\n2. Tag Duplicates Remover: Removes duplicate tags, keeping only the first instance.\n3. Split Tags / Split Sentences: Splits tags or sentences into two sets based on a defined maximum number before splitting."

    {
        "question": "How can the ComfyUI-Nader-Tagging nodes be used in the tagging process?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-Nader-Tagging nodes can be used in the tagging process by splitting tags and strings, alternating tags from multiple sources, removing duplicates, and counting the number of tokens (words) in a given field. This helps ensure accurate and efficient tagging."
