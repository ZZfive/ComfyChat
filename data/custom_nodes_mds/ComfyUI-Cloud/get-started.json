            "question": "What happens after I name and upload my workflow?",
            "answer": "The custom node will search for models, custom nodes, and images your workflow relies on and upload them to your cloud. It may take some time, especially if your workflow uses many custom nodes and models."

            "answer": "The ComfyUI-Cloud node exclusively searches for these within your ComfyUI folder. If you use models from Automatic1111 installation via extra_model_paths.yaml, you must move the models inside ComfyUI and deactivate Comfy's extra_model_paths.yaml."

            "answer": "To locate your most recent generation, scroll to the bottom of the table that pops up after clicking 'View past runs' and select the item with the latest timestamp. If your workflow requires significant time for generation, it will display progress, iterations per second, an estimated time for completion, and an option to halt execution."
