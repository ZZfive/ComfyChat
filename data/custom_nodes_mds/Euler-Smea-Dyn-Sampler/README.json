    "answers": [
        "The ESDFT can significantly mitigate structural and limb collapse that occurs when generating large images, and it can produce superior hand depictions.",
        "The ESDF and the Euler SMEA Dyn Sampler perform very well in SD1.5, with the ESDF more pronounced in SDXL.",
        "Yes, the sampler can be used as an extension for both ComfyUI and WebUI from Automatic1111.",
        "The ESDFT version is suitable for 1.8.",
        "The ESDFT can handle errors during inpainting and extensions use by trying to use the Euler method if an error occurs.",
        "The theoretical basis of the Euler-Smea-Dyn-Sampler's methods is that the dyn method regularly extracts a portion of the image, denoises it, and then adds it back to the original image."
