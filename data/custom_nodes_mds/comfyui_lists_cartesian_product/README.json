        "answer": "Yes, given the input lists: Positive_Cond_List_: [ A, B, C], Negative_Cond_List_: [ a, b ], and CFG_List_: [ 5, 7 ], the transformed output lists would be: Positive_Cond_List_: [ A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, C, C, C, C], Negative_Cond_List_: [ a, a, b, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, b, b], and CFG_List_: [ 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7]."
