# ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts.git`  
to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory

   The script will then automatically install all custom scripts and nodes.  
   It will attempt to use symlinks and junctions to prevent having to copy files and keep them up to date.

- For uninstallation:
  - Delete the cloned repo in `custom_nodes`
  - Ensure `web/extensions/pysssss/CustomScripts` has also been removed

# Update
1. Navigate to the cloned repo e.g. `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts`
2. `git pull`

Adds custom Lora and Checkpoint loader nodes, these have the ability to show preview images, just place a png or jpg next to the file and it'll display in the list on hover (e.g. sdxl.safetensors and sdxl.png).  
Optionally enable subfolders via the settings:  
![image](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/assets/125205205/e15b5e83-4f9d-4d57-8324-742bedf75439)

These should be stored in a folder matching the name of the model, e.g. if it is `loras/add_detail.safetensors` put your files in as  `loras/add_detail/*.txt`  
To quickly save a generated image as the preview to use for the model, you can right click on an image on a node, and select Save as Preview and choose the model to save the preview for:

Supported operators: `+ - * /` (basic ops) `//` (floor division) `**` (power) `^` (xor) `%` (mod)  
Supported functions `floor(num, dp?)` `floor(num)` `ceil(num)` `randomint(min,max)`  
If using a `LATENT` or `IMAGE` you can get the dimensions using `a.width` or `a.height` where `a` is the input name.

## Node Finder
![image](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/assets/125205205/177d2b67-acbc-4ec3-ab31-7c295a98c194)

You can customize the sound by replacing the mp3 file `web/extensions/pysssss/CustomScripts/assets\notify.mp3`

## [WIP] Repeater
![image](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/assets/125205205/ec0dac25-14e4-4d44-b975-52193656709d)
Node allows you to either create a list of N repeats of the input node, or create N outputs from the input node.  
You can optionally decide if you want to reuse the input node, or create a new instance each time (e.g. a Checkpoint Loader would want to be re-used, but a random number would want to be unique)
TODO: Type safety on the wildcard outputs to require match with input

## Show Text
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125205205/230174888-c004fd48-da78-4de9-81c2-93a866fcfcd1.png)

Supports appending and replacing text  
`tidy_tags` will add commas between parts when in `append` mode.  
`replace` mode supports regex replace by using `/your regex here/` and you can reference capturing groups using `\number` e.g. `\1`

## Touch Support
Provides basic support for touch screen devices, its not perfect but better than nothing

## Widget Defaults
![image](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/assets/125205205/3d675032-2b19-4da8-a7d7-fa2d7c555daa)

The node can also be collapsed to a single point that you can drag around.  
![image](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/assets/125205205/a9bd0112-cf8f-44f3-af6d-f9a8fed152a7)
