            "answer": "The TAESD previewer had its CUDA-specific stuff removed as the performance gains were marginal but it majorly affected VRAM usage. Heuristics for batch preview layout were hopefully improved, and a `maxed_batch_step_mode` setting was added. The fixed reversed HyperTile default start/end step values, and it was allowed to only apply HyperTile at a step interval."
