## <a name="PromptTermList"></a>PromptTermList (1-6)
These are some nodes that help with the creation of Prompts inside [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

### Usage
Every one of the 6 nodes have a different `json` file that stores its Prompt Terms in "label"/"value" pairs.  
The "label" part is what we see at the node's dropdown menu, and the "value" part is what it produces at its `Term` output when we run a generation job.  
  
These `json` files are located inside the `TermLists` directory, in the node's folder.  
There are two ways to add a new term.  
* From within ComfyUI:
  * Connect a text box to the node's `text` input.  
  * Write the "label"/"value" part in the box using the following format:  
  ```
  label=Descriptive text
  value=masterpiece, artful and cozy
  ```
  * Enable the `store_input` switch.  
  * Run a generation job.  
  * Refresh the page.  
* Manually:
  * Just open the `json` file and add/remove/change entries. 

  Of course we must be very careful with this, to keep the `json` format of labels/values (with the appropriate commas), otherwise the file will not be parsed.  

This `text` input is also useful if we want to manually add something *after* our term, or as the *only* term if we select the `None` label of the dropdown.  
The `strength` value is changing the impact of the term by using the parenthesis format like this: `(a great term:1.3)`  
  
We can delete a term by sending an empty value to the `text` input like this:
```
label=The label to be deleted
value=
```

## <a name="ResolutionScale"></a>Resolution Scale  
![Demo workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noembryo/ComfyUI-noEmbryo/master/stuff/res_scale1.png)
A simple node that outputs the resolution of an image using the dimensions of an input image or some custom user-defined dimensions, using a Scale Factor.  

If there is an input image connected, setting either `width` or `height` to 0 will use the other dimension to scale the image (but always multiple of 4).

## <a name="RegexTextChopper"></a>Regex Text Chopper  
![Demo workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noembryo/ComfyUI-noEmbryo/master/stuff/regex_text.png)
A node that "chops" a text using a regular expression and outputs the chopped parts of the text.
