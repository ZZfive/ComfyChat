        "question": "What are the diffusion tiling algorithms supported by ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion?",
        "answer": "The extension supports two SOTA diffusion tiling algorithms: `Mixture of Diffusers` and `MultiDiffusion`."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What are the dimensions in the Features table?",
        "answer": "The dimensions shown in the Features table are in pixels and then converted to latent-space sizes."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "How can I see the tile seams and then adjust the options to my needs?",
        "answer": "Set `tile_overlap` to 0 and `denoise` to 1 to see the tile seams, and then adjust the options accordingly."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What are the benefits of increasing `tile_batch_size`?",
        "answer": "Increasing `tile_batch_size` can increase the speed of processing, but your machine must be able to handle it."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What is the recommended tile size for Tiled VAE?",
        "answer": "The recommended tile sizes are given upon the creation of the node based on the available VRAM."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What is the impact of enabling `fast` for the decoder in Tiled VAE?",
        "answer": "Enabling `fast` for the decoder may produce images with slightly higher contrast and brightness."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What is the purpose of `color_fix` in Tiled VAE?",
        "answer": "`color_fix` can restore colors if tiles are too small. It is only for the encoder."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "What is the expected image quality when using `MultiDiffusion` or `Mixture of Diffusers`?",
        "answer": "The image quality when using either `MultiDiffusion` or `Mixture of Diffusers` should be as per the SOTA (State of the Art) standards."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion",
        "question": "Can you provide examples of images that can be loaded in ComfyUI using the ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion extension?",
        "answer": "Yes, the following images can be loaded: `Simple upscale.` and `4x upscale. 3 passes.`"
