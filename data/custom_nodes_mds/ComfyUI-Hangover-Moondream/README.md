üëç For testing, research and fun. There might be issues when loading this node, and/or additional packages needs to be installed. It worked fine after I reinstalled the latest release of ComfyUI.

## Updates

* Now passing proper prompt to the model üêû
* Model/code update[moondream2](https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream2). This should resolve issues with the 'Tensor size mismatch' error when using newer versions of transformers.**Make sure that you select the moondream2 model within the node to receive the updated files from huggingface.** If moondream2 works fine, you can remove the old model files, usually located in the user\\.cache\huggingface folder: hub\models--vikhyatk--moondream1 and modules\transformers_modules\vikhyatk\moondream1 to save disk space.üîÑ
* End support for moondream1 in order to change the license for this repository to[Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).
