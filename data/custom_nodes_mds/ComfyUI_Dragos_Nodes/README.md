Nodes that i want/need in my workflow but that i think outhers could have use for.

# File Padding Node
A node that checks a folder and returns a padded string depending on the .png files in it.

An exaple is you have a folder with 3 .png files in it and you have set the padding to 4 it will give you a string "0003"

If using [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer/) you may need to change the `./ComfyUI/output/` to `./output/`
