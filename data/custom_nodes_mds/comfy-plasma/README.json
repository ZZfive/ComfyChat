            "question": "What is Comfy-Plasma?",
            "answer": "Comfy-Plasma is a simple plasma noise generator for ComfyUI that allows the generation of various types of noise."
        },
        {
            "question": "What types of noise can be generated using Comfy-Plasma?",
            "answer": "Comfy-Plasma can generate plasma noise, random noise, greyscale noise, pink noise, and brown noise."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the key parameters of the Plasma Noise node?",
            "answer": "The key parameters of the Plasma Noise node include Width, Height, Turbulence, Value Min/Max, Red Min/Max, Green Min/Max, Blue Min/Max, and Seed."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the Turbulence parameter affect the noise in the Plasma Noise node?",
            "answer": "The Turbulence parameter scales the noise clouds, with lower values resulting in smoother, larger clouds and higher values resulting in more static-like noise."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the Seed parameter work across different noise nodes in Comfy-Plasma?",
            "answer": "The Seed parameter ensures a specific noise seed is replicated on every execution, and can have settings such as Fixed, Increment, Decrement, and Randomize."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the purpose of the Plasma KSampler node?",
            "answer": "The Plasma KSampler node takes a noise seed and creates a resolved image based on the progressive growing of the noise."
        },
        {
            "question": "What parameters are available in the Plasma KSampler node?",
            "answer": "Available parameters in the Plasma KSampler node include Noise Seed, Control After Generate, Steps, CFG, Denoise, Latent Noise, Distribution Type, Sampler Name, and Schedular."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the Distribution Type parameter affect the image generated by the Plasma KSampler node?",
            "answer": "The Distribution Type parameter controls the type of noise algorithm used, with Default using a Gaussian distribution and Rand using a truly random noise algorithm."
        },
        {
            "question": "What workflow examples are provided for using Comfy-Plasma?",
            "answer": "The document provides workflow examples for using Plasma Sampler with and without Plasma Noise."
