# ComfyUI-extensions

Intended for use with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). To use, simply download any of the folders and place them in /web/extensions or a subdirectory. If you want them all, you can simply `git clone https://github.com/diffus3/ComfyUI-extensions ./web/extensions/diffus3` when in your ComfyUI directory.

These extensions are by no means polished, and some might even be outright broken.
