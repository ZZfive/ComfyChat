#### 1. Transform Template onto Face Mask

Takes a template and a face mask as inputs, and transforms the template to fit over the face.
It does this via calculating the centroid and eigenvectors of the Face.
Useful for placing things onto a face.
This assumes there is only one shape in the face mask, and such that the shape is comprised of white pixels over a black background.
