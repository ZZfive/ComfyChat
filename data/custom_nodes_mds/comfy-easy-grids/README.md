# Easy Grids for ComfyUI

A set of custom nodes for creating image grids, sequences, and batches in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

## Current Features

* **Create Image Grid** - a node that lets you specify a grid size and then automatically queue up the full number of prompts required, outputting the current x and y position in the grid with each prompt. (It's actually a fully general `for` loop; you might find it useful for purposes other than making grids!)
* **Save Image Grid** - a modified Save Image node that accumulates images until reaching the number specified in its x_size and y_size inputs, then puts them into a grid. Supports labeling the grid through the 'row_labels' and 'column_labels' inputs (which take a STRING_LIST such as that produced by the String List or String List from Text Field nodes), or the 'annotations' input (which takes an input generated by some nodes in the ImagesGrid extension - see Recommended Resources.)
* **Float/Int List** - Allows you to specify a list of up to 6 numbers; the output will be selected using the 'index' input.
* **Float/Int List from Text Field** - Similar to the basic Float/Int List nodes, but allow you to type in the list of numbers manually - in case you need more than 6 or just find the selection widgets cumbersome. Commas, semicolons, colons, and whitespace are all valid delimiters - so e.g. `0.5,2.8:3.33;-2.5 8.1` is a valid input that should resolve to the list `[0.5, 2.8, 3.33, -2.5, 8.1]`.
* **String List** - Lets you specify a list of up to 6 strings, similar to the Float/Int List nodes.
* **String List from Text Field** - Lets you enter a list of strings in a text field. Unlike the Float/Int List nodes, each entry in the list must be delimited by a new line.
* **Float/Int to Text** - Just converts a floating-point number to a text string. Useful for dynamically adjusting token or LoRA strengths, or specifying a list of seeds.
* **Text Concatenator** - Transforms two strings of text into one string. Useful for adjusting your prompt according to the grid indexes.
* **LoRA List** - Lets you specify a list of LoRAs to loop through. 

## Future Features

* **More List-Selector Nodes** - Loop through integers! Strings! Checkpoints! LoRAs! Anything in ComfyUI that you have more than one of!
* **String Formatting** - Even adjusting a small number of token strengths with the current nodes quickly results in an absolute spaghetti of Text Concatenators. My goal is to have a node that provides `printf`- or `str.format`-like capability, substituting input strings at specified points in the text.
* **More visual feedback** - Progress bars and automatically updating counters on the Create and Save Image Grid nodes would be super helpful for knowing where you are in the loop. It might also make sense to have Save Image Grid update on the fly with the images it's received so far.
* **Z-Axis** - A1111 supports an additional axis on its image grids, represented as multiple grids on the final output. This is neat and I'd like to add something similar!
* **More Accumulator Nodes** - If your desired labels don't match the output of a String List node exactly, it's a bit of a pain to automate the process of generating them. One addition that would be helpful for this would be to create nodes that accumulate their inputs over each loop and output a list of all inputs received.

## How To Use

All nodes installed by this extension will be under "EasyGrids" in the Add Nodes menu.

1. Create a "Create Image Grid" node and a "Save Image Grid" node. 
2. Attach the x_size and y_size outputs of Create Image Grid to the matching inputs on Save Image Grid.[^1]  
3. Attach the x_index and/or y_index outputs of Create Image Grid to something you want to vary for each image on the grid. Many nodes in this extension are designed to generate lists which x_index or y_index can act as an index into, but you can also attach them to e.g. the seed input on the KSampler node or anything else that takes an integer as input.[^2] 
4. Set up your workflow as normal, attaching your final image output to Save Image Grid. (You may also want to attach it to a standard Save Image node if you want to save the individual images.)
5. Click the "Queue Full Grid" button on the Create Image Grid node and watch it go! (You can also mash the normal "Queue Prompt" button once for each image on the grid, but why would you do that?)

## How to Install

```
cd <ComfyUI repo>/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/shockz0rz/comfy-easy-grids.git
```

I don't believe there are any additional dependencies beyond what's already installed with ComfyUI; please let me know if I'm wrong about that!

## Known Issues

* None at the moment. Please raise an issue if you find a problem!

## Recommended Resources

* [ComfyUI Custom Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) - the Math Expression node is brilliant for turning your grid indexes into much more interesting numbers - like prompt token strengths, LoRA strengths, etc.
* [ComfyMath](https://github.com/evanspearman/ComfyMath) - also a good resource for turning your grid indexes into math.
* [ImagesGrid](https://github.com/LEv145/images-grid-comfy-plugin) - a similar idea implemented very differently. However, **the Grid Annotations node from ImagesGrid is fully compatible with the 'annotations' input on Easy Grids' Save Image Grid node**, and may be helpful for labeling your grid.


[^1]: The x_size and y_size inputs on Save Image Grid currently default to being selection widgets rather than input points. I'm working on fixing this, but for now, right-click on the Save Image Grid node and click "Convert x_size to input", then do the same with y_size.

[^2]: Keep in mind that the index outputs from Create Image Grid start from 1 rather than 0. The nodes in this repository are designed to expect that, but other nodes expecting list indexes may not.
