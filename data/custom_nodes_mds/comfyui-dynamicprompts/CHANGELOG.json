    "answer": "In comfyui-dynamicprompts version 0.2.1, a bug was fixed due to a backwards incompatible change in the latest version of dynamicprompts. This change caused dynamicprompts to return a SampleResult instead of a str, which was the intended behavior. The fix addresses this issue to maintain the expected operation of dynamicprompts."
