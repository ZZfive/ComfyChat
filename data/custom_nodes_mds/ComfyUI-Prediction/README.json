            "question": "How do I use the custom nodes provided by ComfyUI-Prediction?",
            "answer": "To use custom nodes, go to 'Add Node > sampling > prediction'. An example workflow is provided in 'examples/avoid_and_erase.json'."

            "category": "ComfyUI-Prediction",
            "question": "What are the steps to create fully custom prediction with ComfyUI-Prediction?",
            "answer": "1. Use the 'sampling > prediction > Sample Predictions' node as your sampler. 2. The 'sampler' input comes from 'sampling > custom_sampling > samplers'. 3. The 'sigmas' input comes from 'sampling > custom_sampling > schedulers'. 4. Chain 'conditioning > CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)' to 'sampling > prediction > Conditioned Prediction' to get started. 5. Connect the result to the 'noise_prediction' input of your 'Sample Predictions' node."

            "question": "What nodes are available in ComfyUI-Prediction?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-Prediction includes Primitive Nodes, Convenience Nodes, and Prebuilt Nodes. Primitive Nodes allow all other predictions to be implemented in terms of these nodes. Convenience Nodes and Prebuilt Nodes provide specific predictions like 'Avoid and Erase Prediction' and 'Perp-Neg Prediction'."
