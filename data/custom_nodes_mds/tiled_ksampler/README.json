        "question": "How do I install the tiled_ksampler custom node for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You can install the tiled_ksampler custom node by cloning the repository from GitHub into the ComfyUI/custom_nodes directory and then starting ComfyUI."

        "question": "What are the main modes of the Tiled KSampler Node?",
        "answer": "The Tiled KSampler Node has two modes: when tiling is set to 1, it will tile the image; when tiling is set to 0, it will behave like a normal KSampler node."

    {
        "subject": "Asymmetric Tiled KSampler",
        "question": "How does the Asymmetric Tiled KSampler Node work?",
        "answer": "The Asymmetric Tiled KSampler Node tiles the image based on the values of tileX and tileY. When tileX equals 1, it will tile in the X direction, and when tileY equals 1, it will tile in the Y direction."

        "subject": "Circular VAE Decoder",
        "question": "What is the purpose of using the Circular VAE Decoder with the tiled_ksampler node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of using the Circular VAE Decoder is to apply circular padding during decoding, which helps to prevent bleeding around the edges of the decoded image."

        "subject": "tiled_ksampler",
        "question": "Does the tiled_ksampler node offer asymmetric tiling?",
        "answer": "Yes, the tiled_ksampler node includes an asymmetric version that can be added and used like the KSampler, with the option to tile in the X or Y direction independently."
    },
    {
        "subject": "tiled_ksampler",
        "question": "Who is credited for the tiled_ksampler node development?",
        "answer": "The tiled_ksampler node is based on WAS Studio and uses an example for tiling from Automatic1111. The asymmetric tiling concept is credited to GBJI and the information about the VAE Decoder removing bleeding is credited to hrkljus1."
