        "question": "What is the SD-Latent-Upscaler and how does it work?",
        "answer": "SD-Latent-Upscaler is a small neural network used for upscaling stable diffusion latents. It works similarly to ESRGAN, but it is severely undertrained. It can be used to upscale latents without ruining the image."

        "question": "What is the current issue with SDXL?",
        "answer": "Currently, SDXL has minimal hue shift issues. Because of course it does."

        "question": "How can I install the SD-Latent-Upscaler in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You can install it by cloning the repo to your custom_nodes folder using the command `git clone https://github.com/city96/SD-Latent-Upscaler custom_nodes/SD-Latent-Upscaler`, or by downloading the `comfy_latent_upscaler.py` file to your ComfyUI/custom_nodes folder and installing hfhub using `pip install huggingface-hub` inside your venv."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I use the SD-Latent-Upscaler in my local models?",
        "answer": "To use it locally, create a `models` folder and place the modules there, or clone the entire HF repo to it using the command `git clone https://huggingface.co/city96/SD-Latent-Upscaler custom_nodes/SD-Latent-Upscaler/models`."

    {
        "question": "What is the training procedure for SD-Latent-Upscaler v2.0?",
        "answer": "For v2.0, the network architecture is changed to a bunch of `Conv2d` layers with an `Upsample` at the beginning. It is trained for 1M iterations on DIV2K + Flickr2K, using AdamW + L1 loss and a `OneCycleLR` scheduler."
