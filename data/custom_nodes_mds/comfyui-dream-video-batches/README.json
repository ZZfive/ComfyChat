            "question": "Can I find tutorials for the node packs (this one and the older 'Dream Project Animation Nodes') on the mentioned YouTube channels?",
            "answer": "Yes, for 'Dream Project Video Batches' videos related to the node packs can be found on the following YouTube channel: UCguzih0_nXb6eSFLNWE7pmQ."

            "question": "What is a 'Frame Set' in the context of ComfyUI-Dream-Video-Batches node pack?",
            "answer": "A Frame set is a number of images (in a batch), with frame indices and a frame rate. Most nodes in this node pack work with frame sets."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the function of a 'Camera' node in the node pack?",
            "answer": "The camera nodes are always animating cropping tools - the output should always be smaller in size than the input, to allow for camera 'movement'."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the functions of the 'Blended Transition [DVB]', 'Calculation [DVB]', 'Create Frame Set [DVB]', and 'Divide [DVB]' nodes?",
            "answer": "The 'Blended Transition [DVB]' node fades from one frame set to another over a specified number of overlapping frames. 'Calculation [DVB]' node provides arithmetic and mathematical functions. 'Create Frame Set [DVB]' creates a frame set from an image batch and a specified frame rate. Lastly, 'Divide [DVB]' performs simple divisions of float or int values."
        },
        {
            "question": "What features does the 'For Each Done [DVB]' node provide?",
            "answer": "It is used for file iteration (finalizer) in conjunction with the 'For Each Filename' node. It marks a filename as 'processed' and should be placed very late in the workflow."

        {
            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Frame Set Frame Dimensions Scaled [DVB]' node?",
            "answer": "It recalculates frame dimensions of a frame set with a factor, useful for calculating intermediate step sizes."
