## 🟣 Installation

### Easy Installation

**We are listed in the Comfy Manager custom node list!**

First, install **[ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)** if you have not already.

Then, go to the custom node store and search for "Cute". Click **Install** next to Cute Comfy! That's it! 😄

### Manual / Advanced

To install:

* You have to have **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)** 🤪
  * You don't *have* to have **[ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)**, but it's highly recommended.
* Open a command prompt and navigate to your Comfy directory.
* `cd` into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
* Run: `git clone https://github.com/zer0TF/cute-comfy.git`
* Start ComfyUI.
* Close ComfyUI, and edit the auto-generated `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/cute-comfy/config.yaml` file with your own preferences and folder path(s).
* Start ComfyUI again.

If you see:

```
Cute Comfy: 👁️ I'm keeping an eye on: [[ YOUR COMFY OUTPUT FOLDER HERE ]]
 °º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º° Cute Comfy: Loaded! °º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º°
```

Then it's up and running! 👍

## 🟣 Features

### Automatic Civitai Metadata From Comfy

You read that right. Your exported images from Comfy will now be correctly tagged when uploaded to Civitai.com.
This includes prompt data as well as model and LoRA asset links. (Textual embeddings coming sometime soon~!)

See below for how to configure it. Once it's set up, it "just works" - no extra button pushes necessary!

We map the following:

* Positive Prompt
* Negative Prompt
* Sampler and Scheduler
* Steps
* CFG Scale
* Seed
* Model (🔗 Civitai resource link)
* LoRA(s) (🔗 Civitai resource links)

We support:

* ComfyUI's vanilla **KSampler**
* [Efficiency Nodes](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui)' **KSampler (Efficient)**

💡 **Tip:** We can't always figure out where your stuff is inside of your Comfy workflow - Comfy is crazy! You could have 10 separate positive prompts, 4 model merges, and 5 different sampler steps!

We do our best to support basic workflows (basic txt2img/img2img, and 2-step "hires fix" / latent upscaling).

#### Metadata Conversion Hints

There are some ways you can provide "hints" to the conversion script as to where your metadata is:

| Metadata        | Hint                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Model           | Use the **Civitai Checkpoint Loader** node.                    |
| LoRA(s)         | Use the **Civitai LoRA Loader** node.                          |
| Positive Prompt | Set the title of your **CLIP Text Encode** or **Primitive** node to: `Positive` |
| Negative Prompt | Set the title of your **CLIP Text Encode** or **Primitive** node to: `Negative` |
| Seed, CFG, Sampler/Scheduler, Steps | Use a **KSampler** or **KSampler (Efficient)** node. If you have more than one sampler, set the title of your primary/base one to: `Sampler` |

### UI Overhaul for ComfyUI

Sick of gray, drab UI? Sick of pressing "Extra options" and "View History" every time you open Comfy? Well have I
got the solution for you! 😁💜

* Main menu operations (saving and loading) are moved to the top bar, and less-used operations are in a submenu
* All options are visible when Comfy loads - nothing is hidden behind a checkbox or button press
* Queue and History are redesigned, easier to read, and take up more space
* Most things now have icons instead of, or in addition to, words (less space AND more friendly! 😊 thanks Font Awesome!)
* Any other menu buttons or addons should still load below the history section and scale accordingly

## 🟣 Setup 

### File Watcher / Metadata Converter

The Civitai metadata converter works as a file watcher - you tell it where Comfy is writing your images **that have their workflow/metadata embedded in them**,
and we will watch that directory 👀. When we see a new file, we'll take a look at the Comfy workflow inside and extract all of the relevant bits of information,
then re-write **only the metadata** of the file in a Civitai-compatible format. The image data itself is untouched.

When you first start Comfy after installing this addon, you'll see the following message in your console:

```
❣️➡️ First-time file watcher setup - please edit the config.yaml file located in the folder: "ComfyUI/custom_nodes/cute-comfy"
```

A sample `config.yaml` file will be written to: `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/cute-comfy/config.yaml` - you'll need to edit this file to tell Cute Comfy how to watch for new files.

Here is the default contents:

```yaml
watcher:
  enabled: true
  extensions:
  - png
  folders:
  - Z:\Path\To\Your\Comfy\Output\Folder
  overwrite: false
  keep_workflow: false
  verbose: false
  write_suffix: __a1
```

Modify these settings to suit your needs!

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | If the file watcher feature is enabled (or disabled). |
| `overwrite` | `false` | If `true`, the original file that Comfy writes will be overwritten. **NOTE:** Comfy workflow metadata is lost when converting to Civitai-compatible format, so leave this setting `false` if you want to retain copies of your workflow inside your image files! |
| `keep_workflow` | `false` | If `true`, the original ComfyUI workflow metadata will be retained in the file, otherwise it will be removed and only the Automatic1111-compatible metadata will remain. This setting applies to both overwritten and new files. |
| `write_suffix` | `__a1` | The suffix to add to the image file when saving a copy. Has no effect if `overwrite` is `true`. |
| `verbose` | `false` | If `true`, prints lots more info to the console when it processes an image. |
| `folders` | *A nonexistant sample path you must change.* | Add one or more folders that Cute Comfy should watch for new files. The files written into this folder must contain Comfy workflow metadata, so if you are using a custom saving node, ensure that you are including the metadata in the images written here. Multiple directories are supported and can be watched at the same time. |
| `extensions` | `- .png` | A list of file extensions to watch for and modify. Currently, the only usable extension is .png (adding any others will give you an error), but if/when other image formats are supported in the future (e.g. `.webp`), those can easily be added to this list. |

### Cute UI

There is no setup - it's just on by default. 💜 I may make it toggle-able in a future update.
