            "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE is an unofficial ComfyUI implementation of RAVE, which uses BlenderNeko's Unsampler for noise inversion. It includes a basic workflow using the cupcake train example from the RAVE paper."

            "question": "Which version of stable diffusion was ComfyUI-RAVE mostly tested with?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE was mostly tested with SD1.5, although SDXL does work as well, but potentially not as well as SD1.5."

            "question": "What might be the reason for SDXL not working as well as SD1.5 with ComfyUI-RAVE?",
            "answer": "The multi-resolution training in SDXL might reduce the tiling effect, which could be the reason why it doesn't work as well as SD1.5 with ComfyUI-RAVE."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can ComfyUI-RAVE be used with the SDXL model?",
            "answer": "Yes, ComfyUI-RAVE can be used with the SDXL model, although it might not work as well as with the SD1.5 model due to the multi-resolution training reducing the tiling effect."
