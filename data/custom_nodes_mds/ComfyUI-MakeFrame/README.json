            "question": "How does the 'MakeGrid' feature handle large images?",
            "answer": "The 'MakeGrid' feature creates potentially massive images by plotting given images on a grid. It uses a method for concurrent frame generation and ensures images are resized to be evenly divisible for the calculated number of rows, columns, and 8 to prevent 'resize wobble'. Empty cells are padded with repeats of the last image, as black space can frustrate image generation."

            "answer": "The 'BreakGrid' feature is used to break given image grids back into individual images. It is recommended to use the output from the 'MakeGrid' feature's rows/columns calculation."
