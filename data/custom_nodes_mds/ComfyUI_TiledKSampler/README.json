            "answer": "The ComfyUI_TiledKSampler allows for denoising larger images by splitting it up into smaller tiles and denoising these."

            "question": "How does the random tiling strategy reduce seams?",
            "answer": "The random tiling strategy randomizes the tile positions for each step of denoising, reducing the visibility of seams."

            "question": "How does the padded tiling strategy reduce seams?",
            "answer": "The padded tiling strategy provides additional context to each tile through padding, reducing seam visibility."
