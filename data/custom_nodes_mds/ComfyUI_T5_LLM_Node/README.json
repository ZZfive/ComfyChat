        },
        {
            "question": "What parameters can I adjust for text generation in the LLM_Node?",
            "answer": "Parameters that can be adjusted include `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `repetition_penalty`, `trust_remote_code`, and `torch_dtype`, which control various aspects of the text generation process.",
            "subject": "LLM_Node"
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the `trust_remote_code` configuration parameter do?",
            "answer": "The `trust_remote_code` parameter is a security feature that allows or prevents the execution of remote code within loaded models, enhancing security.",

        },
        {
            "question": "How do I install the LLM_Node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "To install the LLM_Node, you must first ensure ComfyUI is installed and operational. Then, you create a `LLM_checkpoints` directory within the `models` directory, place your transformer model directories in it, and copy the `LLM_Node` class file into the `custom_nodes` directory.",
