# Comfy-LFO
ComfyUI custom nodes to create Low Frequency Oscillators

## About
Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) are used in various fields such as audio synthesis, signal processing, and control systems. They typically generate oscillating signals at frequencies below the human hearing range. In the context of ComfyUI, they can be used to provide varying inputs to other nodes.

## Install
From a terminal in ComfyUI folder:
```bash
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/richinsley/Comfy-LFO.git
```
