            "ComfyI2I is a set of custom nodes to perform image 2 image functions in ComfyUI. All donations are much appreciated.",
            "You should consider contributing to ComfyI2I's development if you find these nodes useful.",
            "The ComfyShop update introduced basic painting features for ComfyUI, including the ability to paint both mask and color with outputs, as well as various brush and image control options.",
            "To access ComfyShop, right-click on any image node that outputs an image and mask in ComfyUI and select ComfyShop in the pop-up menu.",
            "Brush controls in ComfyShop include size, opacity, softness, and color, which can be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts.",
            "Zoom and pan controls in ComfyShop allow for increased control over the image canvas by zooming in and out, and panning by clicking and dragging.",
            "The Save to node in ComfyShop saves anything painted in greyscale to the 'MASK' output and anything painted in RGB mode to the 'IMAGE' output.",
            "Color Transfer node is a standalone node that can take the colors of one image and transfer them to another.",
            "The 'No_of_Colors' variable in the Color_Transfer node allows you to choose the amount of colors to extract from each image, typically between 5-20.",
            "The 'Strength' control is used to adjust the strength of the Color Transfer effect.",
            "The 'Blur_Radius' and 'Blur_Amount' controls in the Color_Transfer node affect the blur at the edges of color segments in the source image.",
            "You can use the Color Transfer node with the Mask_Ops node by outputting individual R, G, B channels to transfer color differentially across channels.",
            "The 'Separate_Mask' option in the Mask_Ops node tells the node whether to separate the mask by each island or keep all islands in 1 image.",
            "The 'Use_Text_Sigma' control in the Mask_Ops node is used to smooth out a mask that has been created by text.",
            "The 'Blend_Percentage', 'Black Level', 'Mid Level', and 'White Level' controls in the Mask_Ops node are used to blend, adjust levels, and levels of the mask.",
            "The 'Shrink_Grow' control in the Mask_Ops node is used to shrink or grow your mask.",
            "The 'Inpaint Segments' node segments and crops masks and images based on the mapped bounding boxes of each mask.",
            "The 'Combine and Paste' node takes new images from the VAE Decode node, resizes them, and pastes them over the original image.",
            "You can find workflow examples for ComfyI2I in the workflows directory, including I2I workflow.json, and Color Xfer Workflow.json.",
            "The I2I workflow.json file includes a basic workflow with all of the nodes combined, showing how they are all connected."
