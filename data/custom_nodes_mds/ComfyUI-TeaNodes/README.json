        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Equalization CLAHE style node added by ComfyUI-TeaNodes?",
        "answer": "The Image Equalization CLAHE style node improves the histogram distribution of images, making it easier for ControlNet preprocessor. It is particularly effective when the image background is removed."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TeaNodes",
        "question": "What is the benefit of the Image Size Approximation node?",
        "answer": "The Image Size Approximation node helps stabilize the speed of image-to-image generation by retaining the image ratio while basing the size on pixel count."

    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-TeaNodes",
        "question": "How does the Image Resize Node simplify the process?",
        "answer": "The Image Resize Node connects to the Size Approximation Node directly, allowing image size to pass through a single wire, and defaults to a node socket instead of requiring conversion from widget input."

    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-TeaNodes",
        "question": "What is the functionality of the Image Scale Node?",
        "answer": "The Image Scale Node allows for easy saving of in-process scrap images at lower resolutions, such as half or quarter, by simply multiplying the image size by a factor."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-TeaNodes",
        "question": "Why has code relying on other repositories been ignored in ComfyUI-TeaNodes?",
        "answer": "The developers are unsure about the licensing implications, so they have chosen to omit code that relies on other repositories for the time being."
