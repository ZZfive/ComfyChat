            "question": "How can a base config be specified in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
            "answer": "The `_BASE_` field can be used to specify a base config file to load first, such as `_BASE_: base.yaml`."

            "question": "How is a config file version number managed in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
            "answer": "A version number is used in the config files for backward compatibility. If your config file is versioned with a config line like `VERSION: 2`, detectron2 will still recognize it even if we change some keys in the future."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion",
            "question": "What are some best practices when using configs in ComfyUI-OOTDiffusion?",
            "answer": "Treat the configs you write as 'code', avoid copying them or duplicating them, use `_BASE_` to share common parts between configs. Keep the configs you write simple, don't include keys that do not affect the experimental setting. Keep a version number in your configs, for backward compatibility."
