            "answer": "The Image Index node in ComfyUI-Hangover-Nodes is set to 0 and auto increments during batch processing of images from a directory. It is responsible for keeping track of the image order and activates 'Auto Queue' to process images automatically. When ComfyUI finishes processing, it stops with an error."
