            "question": "What is the rationale behind changing the size of the image in steps between 576 and 1024?",
            "answer": "The rationale is based on the greatest common denominator of 576 and 1024, which is 64. This allows for resizing that is more likely to result in a coherent video that is not the standard size of 576X1024."

            "answer": "SVD is lenient with such resizing, increasing the chance of maintaining a coherent video that is not the standard size."
