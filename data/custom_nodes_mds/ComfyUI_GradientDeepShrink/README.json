            "question": "What is the purpose of the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node modifies a given model by adding a downscaling operation to a specific block of the model. This operation is applied during the forward pass of the model to downscale the input.",
            "subject": "ComfyUI_GradientDeepShrink"
        },
        {
            "question": "What parameters does the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node accept?",
            "answer": "The GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node accepts parameters such as block_number, downscale_factor, start_percent, end_percent, and downscale_after_skip.",
            "subject": "ComfyUI_GradientDeepShrink"
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the downscale_after_skip parameter in GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node mean?",
            "answer": "The downscale_after_skip parameter in the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node is a boolean flag that determines whether the downscaling operation is applied after the skip connection in the block.",
            "subject": "ComfyUI_GradientDeepShrink"
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the difference between the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale and GradientPatchModelAddDownscaleAdvanced nodes?",
            "answer": "The GradientPatchModelAddDownscaleAdvanced node is a more advanced version of the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node. In addition to the parameters of the GradientPatchModelAddDownscale node, the Advanced version takes a config parameter that defines a set of percentage-scale factor pairs and an interpolate parameter.",
            "subject": "ComfyUI_GradientDeepShrink"
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the interpolate parameter in the GradientPatchModelAddDownscaleAdvanced node?",
            "answer": "The interpolate parameter in the GradientPatchModelAddDownscaleAdvanced node is a boolean flag that determines whether the scale factor is interpolated between the defined pairs in the config parameter or whether the scale factor of the nearest lower percentage is used.",
            "subject": "ComfyUI_GradientDeepShrink"
        }
