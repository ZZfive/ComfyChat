    "q1": "What is the purpose of ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
    "a1": "ComfyUI-Long-CLIP provides a ComfyUI implementation for Long-CLIP, enabling the use of the Long-CLIP model in the SeaArtLongClip module.",
    "q2": "Which model versions does ComfyUI-Long-CLIP support for Long-CLIP replacement?",
    "a2": "ComfyUI-Long-CLIP supports replacing the clip-l in SD1.5 and provides a process for SDXL models.",
    "q3": "How does replacing the clip in SD1.5 with Long-CLIP affect the model?",
    "a3": "Replacing the clip in SD1.5 with Long-CLIP increases the token length from 77 to 248, which is expected to improve the quality of the generated images after testing.",
    "q4": "How is Long-CLIP handled for SDXL models?",
    "a4": "For SDXL models, the clip-g's clip-long model is not available yet. Therefore, the token length is extended in multiples of the max_len, and any excess pad tokens are trimmed.",
    "q5": "What can users expect when using Long-CLIP with SDXL?",
    "a5": "With Long-CLIP in SDXL, users can expect to see more details in the generated images due to the increased emphasis on clip-g's features.",
    "q6": "Where can users download the LongCLIP-L model for ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
    "a6": "Users can download the LongCLIP-L model from the provided link on Hugging Face and save it in the models/checkpoints directory.",
    "q7": "How can users contribute to the development of ComfyUI-Long-CLIP?",
    "a7": "Users can contribute to ComfyUI-Long-CLIP by downloading the repository from the provided Git links, and supporting the project by giving it a thumbs up.",
    "q8": "Will ComfyUI-Long-CLIP support Long-CLIP-G in the future?",
    "a8": "Yes, once the weights for Long-CLIP-G are released, ComfyUI-Long-CLIP will support this model version."
