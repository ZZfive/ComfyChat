            "subject": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting",
            "question": "What is the lighting model used in ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting uses the Lambert Reflection Model for calculating diffuse reflection."

            "subject": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting",
            "question": "What other reflection model is used in addition to the Lambert Reflection Model?",
            "answer": "Besides the Lambert Reflection Model, ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting also uses Phong's specular reflection model to calculate specular reflection."

            "subject": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting",
            "question": "What does the specular_power parameter control?",
            "answer": "The specular_power parameter controls the strength of specular reflection, physically representing the smoothness and gloss of a surface."
        },
        {
            "subject": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting",
            "question": "What is the effect of increasing and decreasing the specular_power value?",
            "answer": "Increasing the specular_power value makes specular highlights sharper, while decreasing it spreads the highlights wider, giving a softer glow."
        },

            "subject": "ComfyUI_TJ_NormalLighting",
            "question": "What is the role of ambient_light in the output formula?",
            "answer": "Ambient_light does not depend on the direction of the light source. When set to 1, the input diffuse_map will be output as is."
