            "question": "How can I use the Image Glitcher node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The usage is fairly simple. You need to plug in an image to the input and adjust the following parameters: glitchiness, which controls how much corruption or chromatic aberration will be present; brightness, brightens the image; and scanlines, for adding CRT TV style scanlines."
        },
        {
            "subject": "CrasHUtils Image Glitcher",
            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'scanlines' parameter in the Image Glitcher node?",
            "answer": "The scanlines parameter in the Image Glitcher node is used to add CRT TV style scanlines to the image."

            "subject": "CrasHUtils Color Stylizer",
            "question": "What does the Color Stylizer node do in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The Color Stylizer node allows you to pick a single color in the image and greyscale everything else, keeping just the one color. However, this node is still a work in progress."

            "subject": "CrasHUtils Query Local LLM",
            "question": "What does the Query Local LLM node do in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The Query Local LLM node allows you to send a query to the [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) API which runs local LLMs, and then outputs the response. Make sure you've enabled the API option in your oobabooga session."

            "subject": "CrasHUtils SDXL Resolution Picker",
            "question": "What is the purpose of the SDXL Resolution Picker node in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The SDXL Resolution Picker node allows users to choose from the pre-trained resolutions that SDXL supports. This is in response to other nodes that do not have the full list of resolutions."

        {
            "subject": "CrasHUtils SDXL Resolution Split",
            "question": "What does the SDXL Resolution Split node do in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "The SDXL Resolution Split node converts the SDXL Resolution into width and height. This allows you to send your selected resolution around with just a single connection and then split it out where you need to, reducing the spaghetti lines."
