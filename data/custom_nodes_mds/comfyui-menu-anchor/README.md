# ComfyUI Menu Anchor
This is an Extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), which moves the menu to the specified corner on startup.

## But Why
If you also install a bunch of Extensions that add buttons to the menu like me, 
half of the buttons are basically out of the screen on launch. 
This solves that... *"problem."*

## Configs
1. You can edit the `configs.js` file to set which of the 4 corners to stick to
2. You can edit the `configs.js` file to make the menu always stick to the corner
