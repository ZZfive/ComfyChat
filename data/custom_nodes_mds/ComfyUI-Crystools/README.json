            "question": "What is ComfyUI-Crystools?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-Crystools is a set of tools for ComfyUI that allows users to see the resources monitor, progress bar & time elapsed, metadata, and compare between two images or two JSONs. It provides better nodes to load/save images, previews, etc., and see 'hidden' data without loading a new workflow."

            "question": "What is the ComfyUI-Crystools resources monitor?",
            "answer": "The ComfyUI-Crystools resources monitor allows users to see real-time stats on CPU, GPU (CUDA only), RAM, VRAM, and space usage. It helps users identify bottlenecks in the workflow and know when it might be time to restart the server, unload models, or close some tabs."
