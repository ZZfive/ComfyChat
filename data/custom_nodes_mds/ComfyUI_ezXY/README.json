            "question": "What features does ComfyUI ezXY provide?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI ezXY provides automatic type-casting for most custom and native nodes, a compact math node, list generation for iteration control, and a versatile XY plotter."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I install ComfyUI ezXY?",
            "answer": "To install ComfyUI ezXY, clone the repository to the `custom_nodes` directory in your ComfyUI directory using the command `git clone https://github.com/GMapeSplat/ComfyUI_ezXY.git`."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the Automatic type-casting script in ComfyUI ezXY?",
            "answer": "The Automatic type-casting script in ComfyUI ezXY patches Comfy UI during runtime to allow integer and float slots to connect, with data types cast automatically and clamped to the input slot's configured minimum and maximum values. It should work with most custom and native nodes but may cause compatibility issues or break depending on your version of ComfyUI."
        },
        {
            "question": "What nodes are included in ComfyUI ezXY?",
            "answer": "Nodes included in ComfyUI ezXY are the *ezXY Driver*, *ezXY Assemble Plot*, *Plot Images*, *String to Label*, *Join images*, *Item from Dropdown*, *ezMath*, *Iteration Driver*, *Strings to List*, *Numbers to List*, *String from List*, and *Number from string*."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the *ezXY Driver* node used for?",
            "answer": "The *ezXY Driver* node is used for generating simple lists for setting up XY plot workflows. It can be used with other list generators or math nodes to drive the primitive inputs of any node."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the *ezXY Assemble Plot* node used for?",
            "answer": "The *ezXY Assemble Plot* node is used for simple image plotting with labels. It works best with the **ezXY Driver** and **String to Label** nodes."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the current status of the tasks in the ToDo section?",
            "answer": "The current status of the tasks in the ToDo section is that a Labeler node and a List widget auto-populator have been completed. Workflow examples, an auto mask output to the Image plotter, comparison operators for the math node, and int/float to string conversions have yet to be completed."
