COMFY-PANTS: CUSTOM NODES FOR COMFYUI


This repo contains a number of QoL nodes I made for myself that I
figured I may as well make available for everyone else. ## Nodes - Make
Square Node - Will pad an image to make it square with a chosen filling
strategy. Sort of like “Resize and fill” from a1111. - TextEncodeAIO -
Tried to hack StylePile-like (the A1111 extension, shoutout btw)
behavior into a ClipTextEncode node, but I’m not sure I’m even doing it
right. ## Installation First clone the repo to your custom_nodes folder:

    cd path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/pants007/comfy-pants.git

Then enter the repo folder and install dependencies through pip:

    cd comfy_pants
    pip install -r requirements.txt
