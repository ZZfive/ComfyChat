            "question": "Explain the purpose of the Fit Size node in Comfy UI.",
            "answer": "The Fit Size node automatically adjusts the size of an image to fit within a specified bounding box, making it ideal for copying screengrab content into Comfy UI without worrying about aspect ratios."

            "subject": "Comfy UI - Fit Size From Int node",
            "question": "How does the Fit Size From Int node work?",
            "answer": "The node scales an image to fit within a given width, height, and maximum size, using basic math to ensure that the output image size is appropriate for Stable Diffusion."
        },
        {
            "subject": "Comfy UI - Fit Size From Image node",
            "question": "What does the Fit Size From Image node do differently from the Fit Size From Int node?",
            "answer": "The node automatically extracts the width and height of the image and can upscale or downscale the size to fit within a specified maximum size."

            "subject": "Comfy UI - Fit Image And Resize node",
            "question": "Explain the functionality of the Fit Image And Resize node.",
            "answer": "The node resizes an image to fit within a bounding box and outputs both the resulting image and a latent batch, making it suitable for img2img workflows."

            "subject": "Comfy UI - Load Image And Resize To Fit node",
            "question": "How does the Load Image And Resize To Fit node simplify image handling in workflows?",
            "answer": "The node combines image handling capabilities into one node, allowing users to easily copy and paste image data without saving images."

        {
            "subject": "Comfy UI - Values section",
            "question": "List the input and output values available in the Values section.",
            "answer": "The Values section provides inputs for vae, image, max_size, resampling, upscale, batch_size, and add_noise, and outputs latent, image, width, height, aspect ratio, and mask."
