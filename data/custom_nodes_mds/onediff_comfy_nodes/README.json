            "question": "How can the 'Load Checkpoint - OneDiff' node be used?",
            "answer": "The 'Load Checkpoint - OneDiff' node is optimized for OneDiff and can be used to load checkpoints and accelerate the model. It also sets 'vae_speedup' to 'enable' for VAE acceleration."

            "subject": "Quantization",
            "question": "What is the feature of quantization in OneDiff?",
            "answer": "Quantization feature is a capability only supported in OneDiff Enterprise. It involves the 'UNet Loader Int8' node used to load quantized models that need to be used in conjunction with the 'Model Speedup' node. The compiled result of the quantized model can be saved as a graph and loaded when needed."

            "subject": "Image Distinction Scanner",
            "question": "What is the function of the 'Image Distinction Scanner' node?",
            "answer": "The 'Image Distinction Scanner' node is used to compare the differences between two images and visualize the resulting variances."

            "subject": "LoRA",
            "question": "What is the example of LoRA integration provided in the document?",
            "answer": "The document provides an example of how to use LoRA models in OneDiff ComfyUI. It demonstrates how to change Loras or adjust their strength without needing to recompile."

            "subject": "ControlNet",
            "question": "What demonstration does the document provide for ControlNet?",
            "answer": "The document provides an example of using openpose controlnet with OneDiff, showing seamless support for various controlnet types."

            "subject": "SVD",
            "question": "What does the SVD example demonstrate?",
            "answer": "The SVD example demonstrates OneDiff's enhancement of a video model, such as text-to-video by SVD."

            "subject": "DeepCache",
            "question": "How does DeepCache improve performance when combined with OneDiff?",
            "answer": "DeepCache, when combined with OneDiff, improves the speed of diffusion models, giving around 3x acceleration."
