            "answer": "Yes, the sensitivity level of NSFW detection can be adjusted. The standard value is 0.5, which is the detection threshold for explicit nudity."

            "answer": "The sensitivity levels available for NSFW detection are 0 (no filtering), 0.5 (threshold for explicit nudity), and 1.0 (sensitivity for detecting images with lingerie/underwear)."
