# LoadLoraWithTags
- Save/Load trigger words for loras from a json and auto fetch them on civitai if they are missing.
- Optional prompt input to auto append them (togglable, simply returns the prompt if disabled).
- Actual alphabetical order.
- Print trigger words to terminal.
- Bypass toggle to disable without aiming the sliders at 0.
- Force fetch (not in the screenshot) if you want to force a refresh.
- It uses the sha256 hash so you can rename the file as you like.

I'm talking about these words right there:
