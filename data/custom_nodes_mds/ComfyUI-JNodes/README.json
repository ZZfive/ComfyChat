        "question": "How does ExifReader handle GPS data in images?",
        "answer": "GPS data in images is split into two different tags for each direction: the coordinate value (GPSLatitude, GPSLongitude) and the reference value (GPSLatitudeRef, GPSLongitudeRef). Use the references to know whether the coordinate is north/south and east/west. ExifReader also provides pre-calculated values for GPSLatitude, GPSLongitude, and GPSAltitude that are negative for values that are south of the equator, west of the IRM, or below sealevel."
