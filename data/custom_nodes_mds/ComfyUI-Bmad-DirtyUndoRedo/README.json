        "subject": "ComfyUI-Bmad-DirtyUndoRedo",
        "question": "Why is it called 'dirty' undo-redo?",
        "answer": "It is called 'dirty' because the author was mainly concerned with getting a somewhat working solution quickly and not so much with implementing it 'right'. For example, the undo/redo data contains snapshots of the entire serialized workflow (this is overkill), and the author has no plans to change it."
