        "question": "What does the Transform Template onto Face Mask node do?",
        "answer": "The Transform Template onto Face Mask node takes a template and a face mask as inputs, and transforms the template to fit over the face by calculating the centroid and eigenvectors of the Face. It's useful for placing things onto a face and assumes only one shape in the face mask with white pixels over a black background."
