            "question": "How does the directional prompt attention extension affect the CLIP and SD parts of the framework?",
            "answer": "The extension only affects the CLIP part of the framework, but since the SD part is conditioned on a summarized representation of the prompt, the SD part still sees all inputs, making it difficult for the method to work consistently."

            "question": "What is the purpose of the causal attention mask in the standard transformer implementation?",
            "answer": "The causal attention mask prevents the current tokens from attending to future tokens, which is useful for language models that are trained to predict the next word."

            "question": "How is causal attention masking implemented within CLIP transformer models?",
            "answer": "The standard CLIP transformer has a built-in causal attention mask that masks out future tokens from the current tokens' attention."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-Manager",
            "question": "What does the 'ComfyUI-Manager' extension implement regarding attention masks?",
            "answer": "The extension allows the transformer to apply attention only on certain tokens in the prompt to limit the effect of contextual words or parts of the prompt on subsequent or irrelevant parts of the prompt."
