### Installation of my customized version
1. Run the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/wolfden/ComfyUi_String_Function_Tree.git```
2. Restart ComfyUI.

This command clones the repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory. You should now be able to access and use the nodes from this repository.

After restart you should see a new menu under the utils submenu called String Function Tree - click on it and a new node will appear in your workflow
