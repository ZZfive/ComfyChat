            "question": "What does the 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' node do?",
            "answer": "The 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' node allows you to upscale an image by a factor using a specified model."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the steps followed by the 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' node to upscale an image?",
            "answer": "The node follows these steps: 1. Upscales the input image with the upscale model. 2. Checks the size of the upscaled image and adjusts it if necessary. 3. Returns the upscaled image."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is the output size of the upscaled image determined?",
            "answer": "The output size is determined by the target size, which is calculated from the upscale factor 'upscale_by'. If the upscaled size is larger, it is downscaled using the 'rescale_method'."
        },
        {
            "question": "What inputs does the 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' node expect?",
            "answer": "The node expects 'upscale_model', 'image', 'upscale_by', and 'rescale_method' as inputs."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the 'rescale_method' input parameter used for?",
            "answer": "The 'rescale_method' parameter defines the method to be used for downscaling the image to the target scale if the upscaled size is larger than the target."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the output of the 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' node?",
            "answer": "The output of the node is the upscaled image, labeled as 'IMAGE'."

        {
            "question": "How do you install the 'comfyui-upscale-by-model' custom node?",
            "answer": "To install, clone the repository into ComfyUI's 'custom_nodes' folder."
