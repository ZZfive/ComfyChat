            "answer": "ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata is a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI that allows adding custom metadata to PNG files, including the prompt and settings used to generate the image. These nodes are also compatible with the 'parameters' metadata item used by AUTOMATIC1111."

            "question": "How do I use the custom nodes provided by ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata?",
            "answer": "To use the custom nodes, add them to your workflow and connect the inputs. This will automatically add metadata to any standard 'save image' nodes."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata",
            "question": "What are the nodes provided in ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata?",
            "answer": "The nodes provided are 'Set Metadata' and 'Set Metadata (All)'. The first node sets a single custom metadata field and optionally updates the 'parameters' field, while the second sets multiple metadata at once and writes them to the 'parameters' field in the png metadata."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata",
            "question": "Is there a specific order in which the Metadata nodes should be executed?",
            "answer": "Currently, the node execution order is not enforced. If the Metadata nodes execute after the 'save image' node, the metadata will not be written to the image. This issue will be fixed in a future release."

            "answer": "To manually install it, clone the repository with the command 'git clone https://github.com/romeobuilderotti/ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata custom_nodes/ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata', and restart your ComfyUI. Example workflows can be found in the 'custom_nodes/ComfyUI-PNG-Metadata/examples' directory."
