    {
        "question": "What is the difference between initial parameters and tuned parameters in the tables?",
        "answer": "The initial parameters refer to the model's parameters before any blending, while the tuned parameters refer to the model's parameters after blending, which is a process of blending the original model's params with the lora model's params."

        "question": "What are the different pooling modes discussed in the document?",
        "answer": "The different pooling modes discussed in the document are AVG and MAX with their 1D and 2D variations."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the blend value in tuned parameters?",
        "answer": "The blend value in tuned parameters is used to control the amount of blending between the original model's parameters and the lora model's parameters. A blend value of 0 means no blending, while a blend value of 1 means full blending."
