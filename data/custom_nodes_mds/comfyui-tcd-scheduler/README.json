            "question": "Which nodes does the custom node repository add?",
            "answer": "It adds TCDScheduler, SamplerTCD Euler A, and SamplerTCD nodes to the Custom Sampler category."

            "question": "Is SamplerTCD fully functional?",
            "answer": "No, SamplerTCD is a work in progress (WIP) and currently only operates as DDIM with no gamma parameter."

            "subject": "LCMScheduler",
            "question": "What is the special parameter of LCMScheduler and what does it control?",
            "answer": "The special parameter is 'gamma', which controls the stochasticity in every step."

        {
            "subject": "LCMScheduler",
            "question": "What does the gamma parameter represent when set to 0 and 1?",
            "answer": "When gamma is set to 0, it represents deterministic sampling, and when set to 1, it indicates full stochastic sampling."
