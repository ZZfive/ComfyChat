            "question": "What is the confession about typing in ComfyUI-Anchors?",
            "answer": "To get types working without extracting the JS code from ComfyUI, the development files (TS) reference Comfy as a sibling. If you want TypeScript hints and checks to work, you need a similar structure. For the JS to run properly, the relative path is swapped in the dist for a different relative path based on where the JS is copied on `__init__`."

            "answer": "Check out the `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` for details on how the path swapping works for the JavaScript files. The configuration is made to adapt the relative path based on where the JavaScript files are copied on `__init__`."
