            "question": "How can I use ComfyUI_NetDist for dual-GPU setups?",
            "answer": "To use ComfyUI_NetDist with two different GPUs or two separate PCs, you must have at least two separate ComfyUI instances and specify different launch arguments such as `--port [port]` and `--cuda-device [number]`. For example, you could use `--port 8288 --cuda-device 1`. If you're running your second instance on a different PC, add `--listen` to your launch arguments and set the correct remote IP."
