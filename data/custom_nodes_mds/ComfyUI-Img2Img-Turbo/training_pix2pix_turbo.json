        "question": "How to train a pix2pix-turbo model using paired data?",
        "answer": "First, download the modified Fill50k dataset. Then, initialize and launch the training script with the required flags such as pretrained_model_name_or_path, output_dir, dataset_folder, resolution, train_batch_size, and enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention. The script supports additional flags for tracking FID, enabling attention, and visualizing results."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Img2Img-Turbo",
        "question": "What is the expected format for the dataset used in training?",
        "answer": "The expected format for the dataset is as follows: data/dataset_name/train_A, train_B, train_prompts.json, test_A, test_B, test_prompts.json."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Img2Img-Turbo",
        "question": "How to monitor the training progress?",
        "answer": "The training progress can be monitored using the Weights & Biases dashboard. The script visualizes training batch, training losses, and validation set L2, LPIPS, and FID scores (if specified)."
