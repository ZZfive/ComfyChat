            "question": "What additional samplers are included in ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers?",
            "answer": "The currently included extra samplers are RES, DPMPP Dual SDE, Clyb 4M SDE, TTM, and LCM Custom Noise."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers",
            "question": "Can you describe the RES sampler?",
            "answer": "RES is a sampler that is somewhat naively momentumized and modified, with thanks to Kat and Birch-San for the source implementation."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers",
            "question": "What sets the DPMPP Dual SDE apart from other samplers?",
            "answer": "DPMPP Dual SDE is a somewhat naively momentumized sampler that includes an added SDE, similar to how 3M samples."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers",
            "question": "Who is responsible for the Clyb 4M SDE?",
            "answer": "The Clyb 4M SDE is a modified DPMPP 3M SDE with an added SDE, and was egotisticalized by the author."

            "subject": "ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers",
            "question": "What does LCM Custom Noise allow?",
            "answer": "LCM Custom Noise offers support for different types of noise other than generic gaussian noise."

            "question": "What K-Sampling nodes are included in ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers?",
            "answer": "The currently included extra K-Sampling nodes are SamplerCustomNoise, SamplerCustomNoiseDuo, and SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo."

            "subject": "SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo",
            "question": "Can you describe how SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo works?",
            "answer": "SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo samples with custom noises and switches between model1 and model2 every step."

            "subject": "SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo",
            "question": "What should be done if vram errors are encountered while using SamplerCustomModelMixtureDuo?",
            "answer": "If encountering vram errors, try adding or removing `--disable-smart-memory` when launching ComfyUI."
