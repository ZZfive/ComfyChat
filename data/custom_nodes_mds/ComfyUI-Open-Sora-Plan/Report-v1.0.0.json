            "question": "What is the Open-Sora-Plan and when was it launched?",
            "answer": "The Open-Sora-Plan is aimed at reproducing OpenAI's Sora through an open-source framework, which enables training of video generation models, including Unconditioned Video Generation, Class Video Generation, and Text-to-Video Generation. It was launched in March 2024."

        {
            "question": "What are the improvements in Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0 compared to previous video generation models?",
            "answer": "Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0 has several improvements, including efficient training and inference with CausalVideoVAE, joint image-video training for better quality, and open-source release of the code, model, and data to facilitate future development in the community."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is CausalVideoVAE and its role in Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0?",
            "answer": "CausalVideoVAE is a spatial-temporal compression applied to the videos by 4×8×8, which enables efficient training and inference in Open-Sora-Plan v1.0.0. It considers the first frame as an image, allowing for the simultaneous encoding of both images and videos in a natural manner, improving visual quality."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the Data Construction process in Open-Sora-Plan?",
            "answer": "The Data Construction process in Open-Sora-Plan involves defining a high-quality video dataset based on two core principles - no content-unrelated watermarks and high-quality and dense captions. The resulting dataset consists of diverse video clips of various resolutions and durations, which are then used to train and evaluate the performance of the model."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the next release preview for Open-Sora-Plan?",
            "answer": "The next release preview for Open-Sora-Plan includes an enhanced version of CausalVideoVAE that minimizes motion blurring and the gridding effect. This preview version is under development and will be released in the next update."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the future plans for the Training Diffusion Model?",
            "answer": "The future plans for the Training Diffusion Model include training support for dynamic resolution and duration, support for longer video generation, and enhanced conditional control to provide users with more options and control over the generated videos."
