    {
        "question": "How to initialize a VQVAE model with ComfyUI Open Sora Plan?",
        "answer": "You can initialize a VQVAE model using the `VideoGPTVQVAE` class, which is a part of the `opensora.models.ae` module."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to train a VQVAE model with ComfyUI Open Sora Plan?",
        "answer": "You can train the VQVAE model using the `train_videogpt.sh` script. This script will train the model using the parameters specified in the script."

    {
        "question": "How to load pretrained VQVAE models?",
        "answer": "You can load a pretrained VQVAE model using the `download_and_load_model` method or the `load_from_checkpoint` method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `encode` method used for in VQVAE?",
        "answer": "The 'encode' method is used to encode a video and return the encodings and embeddings of the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to reconstruct a video from its encodings in VQVAE?",
        "answer": "You can reconstruct a video from its encodings by using the decode method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to test the VQVAE model?",
        "answer": "You can test the VQVAE model by reconstructing a video. The `examples/rec_video.py` script provides an example of how to do this."
