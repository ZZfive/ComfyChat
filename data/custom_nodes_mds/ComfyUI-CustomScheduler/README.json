            "question": "What is the significance of the last sigma value in the image generation process?",
            "answer": "For a full denoise in image generation, the last sigma value should be zero."

            "question": "What other scheduler node has BlakeOne created?",
            "answer": "BlakeOne has also created another scheduler node called ComfyUI-SchedulerMixer, which allows users to create a custom scheduler from a weighted average of the built-in schedulers."

        {
            "question": "Can you describe briefly how ComfyUI-SchedulerMixer works?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-SchedulerMixer works by allowing users to create a custom scheduler by blending different built-in schedulers using weighted averages, giving more flexibility and finer control over the generation process."
