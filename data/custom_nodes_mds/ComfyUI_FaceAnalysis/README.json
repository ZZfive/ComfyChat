            "question": "How is the evaluation conducted for generated faces?",
            "answer": "The best way to evaluate generated faces is by first sending a batch of 3 reference images to the node and comparing them to a fourth reference, which are all actual pictures of the person. This provides a baseline number to compare to generated images."

            "question": "What are the installation requirements for using DLib with ComfyUI_FaceAnalysis?",
            "answer": "To use DLib, you need to download the Dlib Predictor Recognition (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) and the Dlib Face Recognition (dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat) models, and place them into the 'dlib' directory."
