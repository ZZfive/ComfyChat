        "question": "What is the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor used for?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor takes keypoint output from the OpenPose estimator node and calculates bounding boxes around those keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information is required to use the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor?",
        "answer": "You need to provide the width and height of the original image to the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor output for each keypoint?",
        "answer": "It outputs a bounding box within the image with the coordinates `(x,y,width,height)` for each keypoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why might you need to apply padding around the bounding boxes generated by the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor?",
        "answer": "You may want to apply padding because the points on the OpenPose skeleton are inside the limb (center of wrist, middle of shoulder), so padding can help you capture the whole limb or body part."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find a reference for which open-pose control point is which?",
        "answer": "You can find a reference in the OpenPose Docs available at the following link: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/02_output.md."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can I add the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor to my workflow?",
        "answer": "You can add the ComfyUI-OpenPose-Keypoint-Extractor to your ComfyUI by dragging it to your workflow."
