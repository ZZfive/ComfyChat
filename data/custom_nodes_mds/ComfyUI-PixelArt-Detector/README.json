        "question": "What changes were made in Update 1.3 for ComfyUI-PixelArt-Detector?",
        "answer": "In Update 1.3, they updated all 4 nodes. They added OpenCV.kmeans algo to reduce colors in an image, working only when reducing colors. They also added a 'clean up' pixels function that uses Image.quantize to iterate over the image and eliminate colors based on given threshold. They added different algos to reduce image with Image.quantize method (default one), such as MEDIANCUT, MAXCOVERAGE etc. They updated choices to BOOLEANs and toggles, added the 'NP.quantize' method using fast numpy arrays to reduce and exchange palettes, and moved out the grid settings from the Palette Converter to the Palette Loader."
