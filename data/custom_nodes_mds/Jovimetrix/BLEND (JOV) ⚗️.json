        "question": "What does the Blend node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The Blend node merges two input sources using a defined Blend Mode and an optional Opacity mask."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Blend",
        "question": "How does the Blend Mode affect the resulting composite?",
        "answer": "The Blend Mode determines how attributes from each layer interact, influencing the resulting composite."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Blend",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Opacity mask in the Blend node?",
        "answer": "The Opacity mask allows for precise control over transparency, enhancing blending effects."

        "question": "Can you provide a list of all the Blend Modes available in Jovimetrix?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Blend Modes available in Jovimetrix are: NORMAL, ADDITIVE, NEGATION, DIFFERENCE, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, LIGHTEN, DARKEN, SCREEN, BURN, DODGE, OVERLAY, HUE, SATURATION, LUMINOSITY, COLOR, SOFT, HARD, PIN, VIVID, EXCLUSION, REFLECT, GLOW, XOR, EXTRACT, MERGE, DESTIN, DESTOUT, SRCATOP, DESTATOP."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Blend",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'clip' composite mode?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' composite mode allows any transparent section of 'layer below' to be added to the pixels of 'layer above' in the same location."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Blend",
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'destout' composite mode?",
        "answer": "In the 'destout' composite mode, any transparent part of 'layer above' is added to the pixels of 'layer below' in the same location."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Blend",
        "question": "What is the difference between 'srcatop' and 'destatop' composite modes?",
        "answer": "In 'srcatop' composite mode, the layer below is placed above the layer above where the layer above is present. In 'destatop' composite mode, the layer below is also placed above the layer above where the layer above is present, but if the layer below is not present but the layer above is, the layer above is placed."
