        {
            "question": "What are the available models in ComfyUI for image and video generation?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI leverages efficient diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and many custom nodes as plugins to handle different tasks for images and videos."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I extend the functionality of ComfyUI through custom nodes or plugins?",
            "answer": "To extend the functionality of ComfyUI, you can add custom nodes or plugins by following the ComfyUI plugin documentation, which provides guidelines for creating and implementing custom plugins."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can ComfyUI's custom nodes or plugins be used with other user interfaces or software?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI's custom nodes and plugins are designed for use within the ComfyUI environment and may not be compatible with other software or user interfaces without modification."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are there any specific requirements for developing custom nodes or plugins for ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "Requirements for developing custom nodes or plugins may include familiarity with the ComfyUI API, strong programming skills, and knowledge of the specific domain the plugin is intended to serve."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I validate the performance of custom nodes or plugins in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "To validate the performance of custom nodes or plugins, you can test them within the ComfyUI environment using provided validation scripts or by analyzing output performance metrics."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I use TF-efficientnet models in ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI primarily uses efficient diffusion models for image and video generation, but it is possible to integrate TF-efficientnet models by creating a custom node or plugin that utilizes the TensorFlow model."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are there any restrictions on the types of models that can be used with ComfyUI?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI is primarily designed for efficient diffusion models and custom nodes or plugins. However, with the creation of custom nodes or plugins, you may be able to integrate other types of machine learning models."
