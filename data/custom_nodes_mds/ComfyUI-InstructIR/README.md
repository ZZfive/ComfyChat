```

## Crafting Your Instruction
InstructIR simplifies the restoration process by understanding a wide range of human-written prompts. Whether you're looking to denoise, deblur, dehaze, derain, enhance resolution, or improve overall image quality, the model comprehends and executes your instructions with precision. Here are examples of prompts you can use for different restoration needs:

### Denoising
- "Help me reduce the fuzziness in this image."
- "I need this image denoised ASAP."
- "Clean up this noisy image, it's an eyesore."

### Deblurring
- "Please, clean up this blurry photo."
- "My picture's not sharp, fix it."
- "Deblur my picture, it's too fuzzy."

### Dehazing
- "Please, fix the haziness in my image."
- "I need to remove the haziness from this image."
- "Get rid of the fog in my image."

### Deraining
- "I want to eliminate the water from this image."
- "Clear the rain from my picture."
- "Can you get rid of the raindrops in my picture?"

### Super Resolution (SR)
- "I need to enhance the size and quality of this image."
- "My photo is lacking size and clarity; can you improve it?"
- "I'd appreciate it if you could upscale this photo."

### Ambiguous Instructions
- "Please, clear up the mess on this image."
- "I want this image to look good."
- "Make it pop."

### Low-Light (LOL) Enhancement
- "I took this photo during the night, enhance it."
- "The photo is too dark, improve exposure."
- "Can you make the image brighter?"

### General Enhancement
- "Make my image look like DSLR quality."
- "Improve the colors of my image."
- "Can you edit this to look like an award-winning photo?"
