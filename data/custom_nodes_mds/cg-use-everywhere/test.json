        "question": "What is the expected functionality of CG-Use-Everywhere in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CG-Use-Everywhere is designed to ensure that any image within a specified folder has its associated workflow saved with it, allowing for the replication of the same image whenever the workflow is executed."

        "subject": "cg_use_everywhere",
        "question": "Why is it important for an image to have its workflow saved in CG-Use-Everywhere?",
        "answer": "Storing the workflow with the image in CG-Use-Everywhere ensures consistency and reproducibility, making it easier to generate the same image at a later date or on a different device."

        "subject": "cg_use_everywhere",
        "question": "How does ComfyUI handle workflow saves for images in CG-Use-Everywhere?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI uses CG-Use-Everywhere to automatically attach the workflow to an image when it is processed, allowing for the retrieval and execution of the workflow whenever necessary."
    },
    {
        "subject": "cg_use_everywhere",
        "question": "Can the workflow result differ if the same workflow is applied to the same image using CG-Use-Everywhere?",
        "answer": "No, the workflow is designed to be deterministic, meaning that the same workflow applied to the same image using CG-Use-Everywhere should always generate the exact same image."
