            "question": "What does ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN do?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN is a node in ComfyUI that uses RAVE (Robust Aggregation of Video Exemplars) attention as a temporal attention mechanism."
        },

            "question": "How does ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN differ from other implementations?",
            "answer": "ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN differs from other implementations in that it does not concatenate the images together. Instead, it performs the RAVE technique within the UNet's Self-Attention mechanism."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN affect other temporal techniques?",
            "answer": "No, ComfyUI-RAVE_ATTN does not affect other temporal techniques or style mechanisms since it does not alter the images or latents throughout the UNet."
