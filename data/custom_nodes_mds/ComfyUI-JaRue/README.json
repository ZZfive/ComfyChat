            "answer": "If you want to start reading the transcript later in the timeline, you can enter a starting frame with the begin parameter, and the frame counts will adjust. However, the begin frame will always start at the beginning of the YouTube video, not at your last begin point.",

            "answer": "Yes, there is a Text2Image tool included with this library, so you can superimpose the captions on top of the video, but the code to tie it all together is still being worked on.",
