        "question": "What is ComfyUI-Stereopsis?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis is an initiative to integrate a stereopsis effect within ComfyUI, by processing a series of sequential images through the Side-by-Side node and applying Frame Delay to one of the inputs."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis",
        "question": "What applications does the stereopsis effect support?",
        "answer": "The stereopsis effect is compatible with any Virtual Reality headset that supports Side-by-Side (SBS) video playback, offering a practical application in immersive media experiences."

        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis | Side-by-Side module",
        "question": "What does the Side-by-Side module do?",
        "answer": "The Side-by-Side module is a utility designed for concatenating two images side by side into a single image."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis | Side-by-Side module",
        "question": "What are the input requirements for the Side-by-Side module?",
        "answer": "The Side-by-Side module requires two inputs, each labeled as left_image and right_image. Both inputs are expected to be images, represented as PyTorch tensors, with no restriction on the images' width but requiring them to have the same height and channel depth."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis | Frame Delay module",
        "question": "What does the Frame Delay module do?",
        "answer": "The FrameDelay module offers a sophisticated solution for manipulating image batches by repeating and inserting frames, thereby introducing a delay effect without altering the overall batch size."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis | Frame Delay module",
        "question": "What are the input types for the Frame Delay module?",
        "answer": "The FrameDelay module accepts an image batch as input along with parameters to select the frame (selected_frame) and define the delay (frame_delay)."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis",
        "question": "What is the programming language used for these modules?",
        "answer": "Both the Side-by-Side and Frame Delay modules are implemented in Python using the PyTorch library."
    },
    {
        "subject": "ComfyUI-Stereopsis",
        "question": "What are the requirements for using the Side-by-Side and Frame Delay modules?",
        "answer": "To use the Side-by-Side and Frame Delay modules, PyTorch needs to be installed and configured in the working environment."
