            "question": "What is the purpose of the Human-parser-comfyui-node?",
            "answer": "The purpose of the Human-parser-comfyui-node is to provide an out-of-the-box human parsing representation extractor for various downstream applications."
        },
        {
            "question": "On which dataset does the SCHP solution rank 1st?",
            "answer": "The SCHP solution ranks 1st for all human parsing tracks, including single, multiple and video, in the third LIP challenge."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which pretrained models are available for human parsing?",
            "answer": "Pretrained models are available for three popular datasets: LIP, ATR, and Pascal-Person-Part."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I extract human parsing representations using the SCHP models?",
            "answer": "To extract human parsing representations, place your own images in the 'INPUT_PATH' folder, download a pretrained model, and run the 'simple_extractor.py' command with the appropriate arguments."
