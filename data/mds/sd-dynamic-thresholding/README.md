# Stable Diffusion Dynamic Thresholding (CFG Scale Fix)

### Concept

Extension for [StableSwarmUI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI), [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), and [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that enables a way to use higher CFG Scales without color issues.

This works by clamping latents between steps. You can read more [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/3962) or [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/3268) or [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Birchlabs/status/1582165379832348672).

### Credit

The core functionality of this PR was originally developed by [Birch-san](https://github.com/Birch-san) and ported to the WebUI by [dtan3847](https://github.com/dtan3847), then converted to an Auto WebUI extension and given a UI by [mcmonkey4eva](https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva), further development and research done by [mcmonkey4eva](https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva) and JDMLeverton. Ported by ComfyUI by [TwoDukes](https://github.com/TwoDukes) and [mcmonkey4eva](https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva). Ported to StableSwarmUI by [mcmonkey4eva](https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva).

### Installation and Usage

#### StableSwarmUI

- Supported out-of-the-box on default installations.
    - If using a custom installation, just make sure the backend you use has this repo installed per the instructions specific to the backend as written below.
- It's under the "Display Advanced Options" parameter checkbox.

#### Auto WebUI

- You must have the [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) already installed and working. Refer to that project's readme for help with that.
- Open the WebUI, go to to the `Extensions` tab
- -EITHER- Option **A**:
    - go to the `Available` tab with
    - click `Load from` (with the default list)
    - Scroll down to find `Dynamic Thresholding (CFG Scale Fix)`, or use `CTRL+F` to find it
- -OR- Option **B**:
    - Click on `Install from URL`
    - Copy/paste this project's URL into the `URL for extension's git repository` textbox: `https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/sd-dynamic-thresholding`
- Click `Install`
- Restart or reload the WebUI
- Go to txt2img or img2img
- Check the `Enable Dynamic Thresholding (CFG Scale Fix)` box
- Read the info on-page and set the sliders where you want em.
- Click generate.


#### ComfyUI

- Must have [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) already installed and working. Refer to that project's readme for help with that.
- -EITHER- Option **A**: (TODO: Manager install)
- -OR- Option **B**:
    - `cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
    - `git clone https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/sd-dynamic-thresholding`
    - restart ComfyUI
    - Add node `advanced/mcmonkey/DynamicThresholdingSimple` (or `Full`)
    - Link your model to the input, and then link the output model to your KSampler's input

### Supported Auto WebUI Extensions

- This can be configured within the [Infinity Grid Generator](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/sd-infinity-grid-generator-script#supported-extensions) extension, see the readme of that project for details.

### ComfyUI Compatibility

- This would work with any variant of the `KSampler` node, including custom ones, so long as they do not totally override the internal sampling function (most don't).
