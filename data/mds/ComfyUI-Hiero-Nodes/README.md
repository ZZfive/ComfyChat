# ComfyUI-Hiero-Nodes
Just some random custom nodes I need/want to use and programmed for ComfyUI.

## Post w/ Discord Webhook Node

You will need a url to your discord channel's webhook, which can be retrieved by going to Edit Channel> Integrations> Webhooks> New Webhook. 
That will create a new webhook for that channel. You can get the URL for that webhook by clicking on "Copy Webhook URL".

This all requires you to have a Discord server and ability to edit a channel, which if you own the server in question you already have access to that.
