## üì¢ News

* **`2023/07/01`** We release a new version that enables text input and transparency correction!
* **`2023/06/08`** We release arxiv tech report! 
* **`2023/06/08`** We release source codes of Matte Anything!

The program is still in progress. You can try the early version first! Thanks for your attention. If you like Matte Anything, you may also like its previous foundation work [ViTMatte](https://github.com/hustvl/ViTMatte).

## üìú Introduction

We propose Matte Anything (MatAny), an interactive natural image matting model. It could produce high-quality alpha-matte with various simple hints. The key insight of MatAny is to generate pseudo trimap automatically with contour and transparency prediction. We leverage task-specific vision models to enhance the performance of natural image matting.

### Quick Installation

Install [Segment Anything Models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) as following:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

Install [ViTMatte](https://github.com/hustvl/ViTMatte) as following:
```
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) as following:
```
cd Matte-Anything
git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git
cd GroundingDINO
pip install -e .
```

Download pretrained models [SAM_vit_h](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth), [ViTMatte_vit_b](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d97oKuITCeWgai2Tf3iNilt6rMSSYzkW/view?usp=sharing), and [GroundingDINO-T](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth). Put them in ``./pretrained``

### Run our web-ui!
```
python matte_anything.py
```

### How to use
1. Upload the image and click on it (default: ``foreground point``).
2. Click ``Start!``.
3. Modify ``erode_kernel_size`` and ``dilate_kernel_size`` for a better trimap (optional).
