# Various ComfyUI Nodes by Type

This repository provides various nodes for use in ComfyUI.

The nodes are grouped into separate files, you can just download the specific file you want to avoid filling your nodes list with nodes you don't need.

## Installation

### Method 1 (Recommended): Download each file individually

Go though each file and see which nodes you want to use. Download the corresponding file and put it in:

```
ComfyUI/custom_nodes
```

If you want to use `RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels` from `comfyui_raft.py`, you must install `OpenEXR` in your ComfyUI Python environment.

```sh
# Activate your Python environment first.
pip install OpenEXR
```

### Method 2: Clone the repo

This method populates your node list with most nodes in this repository, which may be annoying to some (e.g. me) so I recommend using **Method 1** to keep your nodes list organised.

If you're happy with installing most nodes in this repository, clone the repository to your `custom_nodes` folder:

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/jamesWalker55/comfyui-various
```

## Available Nodes

Each `comfyui_*.py` file contains a group of nodes of similar purpose. This repo is still in early stages so I can't write documentation for each file yet - have a look at the code for each file to see what they are for.

### Other nodes

Some files contain nodes for my own personal use, and are likely completely useless to anyone else. These nodes are hidden by default but can be enabled by setting the environment variable `COMFYUI_JW_ENABLE_EXTRA_NODES` to `true`. These files are hidden by default:

- `comfyui_batch_io.py`
- `comfyui_group_io.py`
- `comfyui_cn_preprocessors.py` _(Use [Fannovel16's preprocessor nodes](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfy_controlnet_preprocessors) instead, they're way better)_
