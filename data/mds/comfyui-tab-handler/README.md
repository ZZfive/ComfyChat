# ComfyUI Tab Handler
This is an Extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), which intercepts the default browser behavior when pressing `Tab` key, 
and focuses the `textarea` instead.

## But Why
By default, **ComfyUI** doesn't handle `Tab` key afaik. So when you press `Tab`, it may just start highlighting your browser tabs or favorites.
Thus, I block it and make it switch between `textarea` *(**ie.** The text inputs such as prompts)* instead.
