# MakeFrame

## BreakFrames:
Break any animation file that OpenCV will process into individual frames.

## GetKeyFrames:
Process scene detection on all given frames, rank-orders, returns top N results. Also returns labeled images.

## MakeGrid:
Plots given images on a grid. Calculates number of rows and columns for most even aspect ratio.
* For concurrent frame generation. Creates potentially massive image.
* Images are resized to be evenly-divisible by rows, columns, and 8 (to prevent "resize wobble").
* Empty cells are padded with repeats of last image. Black space frustrates generation.

## BreakGrid:
Breaks given image grid(s) back into individual images. Good practice to use rows/columns output from MakeGrid.
