- **Dream Typing**: You tell it your dream.

- **Dream Interpretation**: It dives deep into your dream, uncovering meanings you didn't know were there!

- **Dream Generation**: It creates a panorama image of your dream.

- **Interactive Dreamworld**: This isn't just any picture; it's a whole interactive canvas powered by Three.js, letting you explore your dream as if you were there (again).
