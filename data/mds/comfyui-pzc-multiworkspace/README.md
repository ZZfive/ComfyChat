# ComfyUI Multi-Workspace

A simple, quick, and dirty implementation of multiple workspaces within ComfyUI.

Adds 5 quick workspace slots for your convenience when working with flows.

TODO:

I would like this to be automatic in the future, where you can select the workspace and it will be "active" and then update it as the flow is updated.

I think it would also be nice to add in custom nodes for flows that allow workspaces to be part of the workspace, so you can have a multi-stage/multi-step workflow
and it gets saved in the normal workflow way, (for sharing purposes)
