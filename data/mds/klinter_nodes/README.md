# klinter_nodes
 This is create as to challange my non-existent coding skills.
 I'm creating nodes I like to use in my workflows as I try to learn how things works.

Nodes in the pack:
String concat: to add strings together - used for creating prompts mostly
Filter: just a POC of a bad words list filtering system that changes the bad words found in a prompt to a good one
Size selector : i use this in almost all my workflows - calling for sizes from an external list - WIP - 
 (to do: aspect ratio chooser, custom size option, h/w one size calculator)
PresentString: n/a atm
