The typings in node_modules or in ComfyUI's web/ directory were not that well covered. These typings are hacked together with some of the inconsistencies I found.

To be honest, I have no idea why I needed a bizarre workaround for litegraph's types. Usually the '/// &lt;reference>' comment should have picked up the types, but it wasn't having it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
