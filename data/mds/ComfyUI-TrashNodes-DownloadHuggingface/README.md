# ComfyUI-TrashNodes-DownloadHuggingface
# Description - what does this shit do?
ComfyUI-TrashNodes-DownloadHuggingface is a ComfyUI node designed to facilitate the download of models you have just trained and uploaded to Hugging Face. This node is particularly useful for users who employ Google Colab for training and need to quickly download their models for deployment.

to use it perfectly, use the node of this workflow: [nodes.json](https://github.com/adbrasi/ComfyUI-TrashNodes-DownloadHuggingface/files/14214839/nodes.json)



Features
Simplifies the download process for models trained on Google Colab and uploaded to Hugging Face.
Streamlines the workflow for users who frequently train and deploy models.

Note
Observation: I'm not a  programmer; I simply researched and experimented to create this . ChatGPT wasn't very helpful , so it took me a while to figure things out. However, I'm getting the hang of it. I plan to develop more nodes soon, including one for using Kohya and another for uploading files to Hugging Face. I'll be watching some Python tutorials over the weekend to better understand what I'm doing.

Feel free to contribute and improve this, with love, your best friend: ADBRASI love xereca
