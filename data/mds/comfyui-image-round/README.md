# comfyui-image-round

A simple "Round Image" node to round an image up (pad) or down (crop) to the nearest integer multiple. Padding offset from left/bottom and the padding value are adjustable.

There's also an "Round Image Advanced" version of the node with optional node-driven inputs and outputs, which was designed to be used with the extra "Crop Image Advanced" node for taking padding outputs from the "Round Image Advanced" node and cropping the image back down to the original size.
