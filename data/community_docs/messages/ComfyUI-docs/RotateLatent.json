        "question": "What is the purpose of the Rotate Latent node?",
        "answer": "The Rotate Latent node is used to rotate latent images clockwise in increments of 90 degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required for the Rotate Latent node?",
        "answer": "The inputs required are 'samples' for the latent images to be rotated and 'rotation' specifying the clockwise rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Rotate Latent node produce as output?",
        "answer": "The Rotate Latent node produces 'LATENT', which refers to the rotated latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage of the Rotate Latent node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves providing the latent images to be rotated as 'samples' and specifying the clockwise rotation amount using 'rotation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Rotate Latent node handle image rotation?",
        "answer": "It rotates latent images in clockwise direction, adjusting them in increments of 90 degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of transformations does the Rotate Latent node perform?",
        "answer": "The Rotate Latent node performs rotational transformations on latent images."

    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the Rotate Latent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the Rotate Latent node primarily functions to rotate latent images."
