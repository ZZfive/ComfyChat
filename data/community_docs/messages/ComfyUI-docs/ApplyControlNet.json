        "question": "What is the Apply ControlNet node used for?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet node is used to provide visual guidance to a diffusion model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Apply ControlNet node differ from unCLIP embeddings?",
        "answer": "Unlike unCLIP embeddings, controlnets and T2I adaptors can work on any model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can be achieved by chaining multiple Apply ControlNet nodes together?",
        "answer": "Chaining multiple Apply ControlNet nodes allows guiding the diffusion model using multiple controlNets or T2I adaptors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can Apply ControlNet nodes help in indicating where edges in the final image should be?",
        "answer": "Apply ControlNet nodes can achieve this by using an image containing edge detections along with a controlNet trained on edge detection images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the Apply ControlNet node require?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet node requires conditioning, control_net, and image inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Apply ControlNet node output?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet node outputs a Conditioning containing the control_net and visual guide."
