            "question": "What is the LoadControlNet node used for?",
            "answer": "The LoadControlNet node is used to load a ControlNet model, which provides visual hints to a diffusion model."

            "question": "How does the LoadControlNet node differ from providing a partially noised up image to modify?",
            "answer": "Unlike providing a partially noised up image, the LoadControlNet node uses ControlNet models to guide a diffusion model by specifying details like where edges in the final image should be or how subjects should be posed."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the input required by the LoadControlNet node?",
            "answer": "The input required is the name of the ControlNet model, specified as `control_net_name`."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the LoadControlNet node output?",
            "answer": "The LoadControlNet node outputs the ControlNet or T2IAdaptor model, which is used to provide visual hints to a diffusion model."
        },
        {
            "question": "Could you describe an example usage scenario for the LoadControlNet node?",
            "answer": "An example usage scenario involves using the LoadControlNet node within a workflow to load a ControlNet model and provide visual guidance to a diffusion model. This includes specifying the `control_net_name` input and utilizing the resulting ControlNet or T2IAdaptor model."
        },
        {
            "question": "What types of hints does a ControlNet model provide to a diffusion model?",
            "answer": "A ControlNet model provides visual hints such as where edges in the final image should be and how subjects should be posed."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the purpose of loading T2IAdaptors using the LoadControlNet node?",
            "answer": "The LoadControlNet node can also be used to load T2IAdaptors, which are used alongside ControlNet models to provide additional visual guidance to a diffusion model."
