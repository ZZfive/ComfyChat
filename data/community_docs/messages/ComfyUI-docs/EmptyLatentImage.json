        "question": "What is the purpose of the Empty Latent Image node?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Image node is used to create a new set of empty latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Empty Latent Image node be utilized in a workflow?",
        "answer": "It can be used inside a text2image workflow by noising and denoising the generated latent images with a sampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required by the Empty Latent Image node?",
        "answer": "The inputs include width (for the width of the latent images in pixels), height (for the height of the latent images in pixels), and batch_size (indicating the number of latent images to be created)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Empty Latent Image node output?",
        "answer": "It outputs empty latent images represented by the LATENT parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage of the Empty Latent Image node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves integrating it into a workflow, such as text2image, and manipulating the resulting latent images using a sampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Empty Latent Image node contribute to image generation?",
        "answer": "It provides a starting point by generating empty latent images that can be further processed and transformed in subsequent steps of the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what contexts is the Empty Latent Image node particularly useful?",
        "answer": "It is particularly useful in scenarios where initializing empty latent images is necessary for subsequent image generation processes."
