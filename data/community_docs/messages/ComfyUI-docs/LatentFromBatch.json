        "question": "What is the Latent From Batch node used for?",
        "answer": "The Latent From Batch node is used to pick a slice from a batch of latents. It allows isolating specific latent images within the batch during the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Latent From Batch node require?",
        "answer": "The Latent From Batch node requires three inputs: 'samples', which is the batch of latent images to pick a slice from; 'batch_index', which indicates the index of the first latent image to pick; and 'length', which specifies how many latent images to include in the slice."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' input represent in the Latent From Batch node?",
        "answer": "In the Latent From Batch node, 'samples' refers to the batch of latent images from which a slice can be chosen."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'batch_index' input in the Latent From Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_index' input in the Latent From Batch node specifies the index of the first latent image to be selected from the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Latent From Batch node handle the 'length' input?",
        "answer": "The 'length' input in the Latent From Batch node determines how many latent images should be included in the slice chosen from the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Latent From Batch node provide?",
        "answer": "The Latent From Batch node provides an output labeled 'LATENT', which consists of a new batch of latent images containing only the selected slice."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you describe an example usage scenario of the Latent From Batch node?",
        "answer": "An example usage of the Latent From Batch node involves selecting a specific slice of latent images from a batch, which is useful for isolating particular image data during the workflow."
