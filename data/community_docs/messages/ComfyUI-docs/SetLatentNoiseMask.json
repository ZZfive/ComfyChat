        "question": "What is the purpose of the Set Latent Noise Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Set Latent Noise Mask node is used to add a mask to the latent images for inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Set Latent Noise Mask node affect inpainting?",
        "answer": "It allows a mask to be applied to the latent images, restricting inpainting operations to the masked areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Set Latent Noise Mask node require?",
        "answer": "The Set Latent Noise Mask node requires 'samples', which are the latent images to be masked for inpainting, and 'mask', which indicates where to apply the inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Set Latent Noise Mask node provide?",
        "answer": "The Set Latent Noise Mask node provides 'LATENT', which are the masked latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Set Latent Noise Mask node handle multiple masks simultaneously?",
        "answer": "No, if a single mask is provided, all latents in the batch will use this same mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you describe an example usage scenario of the Set Latent Noise Mask node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves using the node to mask latent images for inpainting, where a mask is applied to restrict the inpainting operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of nodes can the Set Latent Noise Mask node interact with?",
        "answer": "It can interact with sampler nodes, where the mask restricts the operation of the sampler to the masked area of the latent images."
