        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Blur node?",
        "answer": "The Image Blur node applies a gaussian blur to an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Image Blur node require?",
        "answer": "The Image Blur node requires 'image' as the pixel image to be blurred, 'blur_radius' as the radius of the gaussian, and 'sigma' as the sigma of the gaussian."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigma' parameter control in the Image Blur node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma' parameter controls how much the kernel is concentrated on the center pixel in the gaussian blur applied by the Image Blur node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Blur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Blur node is a blurred pixel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the example usage of the Image Blur node?",
        "answer": "The example usage involves applying a workflow image with the Image Blur node to demonstrate its functionality."
