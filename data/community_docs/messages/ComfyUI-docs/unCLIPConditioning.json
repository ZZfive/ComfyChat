        "question": "What is the unCLIP Conditioning node used for?",
        "answer": "The unCLIP Conditioning node is used to provide unCLIP models with additional visual guidance through images encoded by a CLIP vision model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for the unCLIP Conditioning node to function properly?",
        "answer": "The unCLIP Conditioning node specifically requires a diffusion model that was made with unCLIP in mind."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the unCLIP Conditioning node accept?",
        "answer": "The inputs include conditioning, an image encoded by a CLIP VISION model, strength indicating how strongly the unCLIP diffusion model should be guided, and noise_augmentation for providing additional variations closely related to the encoded image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' input parameter determine?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input parameter determines how strongly the unCLIP diffusion model should be guided by the image encoded by a CLIP vision model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can noise_augmentation be used with the unCLIP Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "noise_augmentation can be used to guide the unCLIP diffusion model to random places in the neighborhood of the original CLIP vision embeddings, providing additional variations of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the unCLIP Conditioning node output?",
        "answer": "The unCLIP Conditioning node outputs a Conditioning containing additional visual guidance for unCLIP models."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you describe an example usage of the unCLIP Conditioning node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves utilizing the unCLIP Conditioning node within a workflow, where it provides visual guidance through images and enhances the generation process of unCLIP models."
