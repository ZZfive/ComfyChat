        "question": "What is Conditioning (Average) in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Conditioning (Average) in ComfyUI is a node used to interpolate between two text embeddings based on a strength factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Conditioning (Average) node function?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning (Average) node mixes text embeddings from 'conditioning_to' and 'conditioning_from' according to the 'conditioning_to_strength' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required for the Conditioning (Average) node?",
        "answer": "The inputs include 'conditioning_to', 'conditioning_from', and 'conditioning_to_strength'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the 'conditioning_to_strength' parameter.",
        "answer": "'conditioning_to_strength' determines the mixing ratio of 'conditioning_to' and 'conditioning_from' in the Conditioning (Average) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Conditioning (Average) node provide?",
        "answer": "The output is a new conditioning with text embeddings mixed based on the specified 'conditioning_to_strength'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you provide an example of using the Conditioning (Average) node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves mixing text embeddings using the Conditioning (Average) node, demonstrating its functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Conditioning (Average) node contribute to image and video generation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning (Average) node enhances ComfyUI's capability to generate images and videos by allowing interpolation between text embeddings."
