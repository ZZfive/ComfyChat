        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Quantize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Quantize node in ComfyUI is used to quantize an image, reducing the number of colors in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Image Quantize node require?",
        "answer": "The Image Quantize node requires inputs such as 'image' (the pixel image to be quantized), 'colors' (the number of colors in the quantized image), and 'dither' (whether to use dithering to make the quantized image look more smooth or not)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'colors' parameter represent in the Image Quantize node?",
        "answer": "In the Image Quantize node, the 'colors' parameter represents the number of colors in the quantized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'dither' parameter affect the output of the Image Quantize node?",
        "answer": "The 'dither' parameter in the Image Quantize node controls whether dithering is used to make the quantized image appear smoother."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Quantize node output?",
        "answer": "The Image Quantize node outputs a quantized pixel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the example usage of the Image Quantize node?",
        "answer": "The example usage of the Image Quantize node includes a text description and a workflow image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of image does the Image Quantize node process?",
        "answer": "The Image Quantize node processes pixel images."
