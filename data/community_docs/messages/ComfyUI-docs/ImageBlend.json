        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend node blends two images together."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Blend node handle images with different dimensions?",
        "answer": "If the dimensions of the second image do not match those of the first, it is rescaled and center-cropped to maintain its aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Image Blend node require?",
        "answer": "The inputs include 'image1', 'image2', 'blend_factor', and 'blend_mode'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'blend_factor' input represent in the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_factor' input represents the opacity of the second image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Blend node determine how to blend the images?",
        "answer": "The blending mode is specified by the 'blend_mode' input."

    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Image Blend node produce?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Blend node is a blended pixel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage scenario of the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves blending two images together with specified parameters, resulting in a blended pixel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can you achieve using the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "You can achieve blending of two images with control over opacity and blending mode."
