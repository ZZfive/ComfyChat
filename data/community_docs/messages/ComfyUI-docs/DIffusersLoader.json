        "question": "What is the Diffusers Loader node?",
        "answer": "The Diffusers Loader node is used to load a diffusion model from diffusers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Diffusers Loader node require?",
        "answer": "The Diffusers Loader node requires an input named 'model_path' which specifies the path to the diffusers model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Diffusers Loader node provide?",
        "answer": "The Diffusers Loader node provides three outputs: 'MODEL' which is used for denoising latents, 'CLIP' which is the CLIP model used for encoding text prompts, and 'VAE' which is the VAE model used for encoding and decoding images to and from latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the example usage of the Diffusers Loader node?",
        "answer": "The example usage involves text with a workflow image, demonstrating how the Diffusers Loader node is integrated into a workflow."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'MODEL' output from the Diffusers Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'MODEL' output from the Diffusers Loader node is used specifically for denoising latents."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Diffusers Loader node contribute to image and video generation?",
        "answer": "The Diffusers Loader node contributes by loading diffusion models necessary for generating images and videos using ComfyUI."
