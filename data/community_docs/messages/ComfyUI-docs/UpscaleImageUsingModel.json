    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for the Upscale Image (using Model) node?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Image (using Model) node requires inputs for the upscale_model, which is the model used for upscaling, and the image, which are the pixel images to be upscaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the upscale_model input represent in the Upscale Image (using Model) node?",
        "answer": "The upscale_model input in the Upscale Image (using Model) node represents the model used specifically for upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the image input represent in the Upscale Image (using Model) node?",
        "answer": "The image input in the Upscale Image (using Model) node represents the pixel images that will undergo upscaling."
