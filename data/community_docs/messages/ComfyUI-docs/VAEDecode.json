        "question": "What is the purpose of the VAE Decode node in ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader?",
        "answer": "The VAE Decode node decodes latent space images into pixel space images using a specified VAE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the VAE Decode node in ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader require?",
        "answer": "The VAE Decode node requires 'samples', which are the latent images to be decoded, and 'vae', the VAE used for decoding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VAE Decode node in ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader?",
        "answer": "The output of the VAE Decode node is 'IMAGE', which represents the decoded images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example application of the VAE Decode node in ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader?",
        "answer": "An example application involves decoding latent space images into pixel space images, as illustrated in SD 1.5 to XL example."

    {
        "question": "How does the VAE Decode node contribute to ComfyUI's image processing capabilities?",
        "answer": "The VAE Decode node enhances ComfyUI's capabilities by transforming latent space representations into visible images using the provided VAE model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of images does the VAE Decode node handle in ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader?",
        "answer": "The VAE Decode node handles latent space images that need to be converted into pixel space images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the VAE Decode node play in the workflow of ComfyUI's DiffusersLoader?",
        "answer": "The VAE Decode node serves as a critical component for converting latent representations into visually interpretable images within ComfyUI's workflow."
