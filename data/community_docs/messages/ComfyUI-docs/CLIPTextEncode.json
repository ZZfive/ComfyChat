        "question": "What is the CLIP Text Encode node used for?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Text Encode node is used to encode a text prompt using a CLIP model into an embedding that can guide the diffusion model to generate specific images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the CLIP Text Encode node require?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Text Encode node requires inputs such as 'clip', which is the CLIP model used for encoding, and 'text', which is the text to be encoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'CONDITIONING' output from the CLIP Text Encode node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'CONDITIONING' output represents a Conditioning containing the embedded text used to guide the diffusion model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain an example usage of the CLIP Text Encode node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves providing a text prompt which is encoded using the CLIP model into an embedding. This embedding then serves as Conditioning to guide the diffusion model in generating specific images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find more details about text prompt related features in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "More details about text prompt related features in ComfyUI can be found on [this](../../Interface/Textprompts.md) page."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIP Text Encode node contribute to image generation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Text Encode node contributes by encoding text prompts with a CLIP model, producing embeddings that guide the diffusion model in generating specific images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the CLIP model play in the CLIP Text Encode node?",
        "answer": "The CLIP model in the CLIP Text Encode node is used to encode the text prompt into an embedding, which is then used for conditioning in image generation."
