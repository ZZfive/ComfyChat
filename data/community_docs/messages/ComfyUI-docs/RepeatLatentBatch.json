        "question": "What is the purpose of the RepeatLatentBatch node?",
        "answer": "The RepeatLatentBatch node repeats a batch of latent images to create multiple variations of an image in an image to image workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the RepeatLatentBatch node require?",
        "answer": "The RepeatLatentBatch node requires 'samples', which is the batch of latent images to be repeated, and 'amount', specifying the number of repeats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the RepeatLatentBatch node produce?",
        "answer": "The RepeatLatentBatch node produces 'LATENT', which is a new batch of latent images repeated according to the specified amount."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe how the RepeatLatentBatch node is used in an image to image workflow?",
        "answer": "The RepeatLatentBatch node is used to generate multiple variations of an image by repeating a batch of latent images, thereby enhancing the diversity of outputs in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'samples' input in the RepeatLatentBatch node?",
        "answer": "'samples' input in the RepeatLatentBatch node represents the batch of latent images that will undergo repetition to generate multiple variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'amount' input affect the operation of the RepeatLatentBatch node?",
        "answer": "'amount' input in the RepeatLatentBatch node determines how many times the batch of latent images ('samples') will be repeated to produce the desired output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of workflow benefits from using the RepeatLatentBatch node?",
        "answer": "The RepeatLatentBatch node benefits image to image workflows by enabling the creation of diverse variations of an image through batch repetition of latent images."
