        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadCLIPVision node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadCLIPVision node is used to load a specific CLIP vision model, similar to how CLIP models encode text prompts, but here they encode images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadCLIPVision node contribute to ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "It contributes by providing a method to load and utilize CLIP vision models for encoding image prompts within the ComfyUI environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input required by the LoadCLIPVision node?",
        "answer": "The input required is the name of the CLIP vision model ('clip_name')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LoadCLIPVision node output?",
        "answer": "It outputs the loaded CLIP vision model ('CLIP_VISION') that can be used for encoding image prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you explain how CLIP vision models are used with the LoadCLIPVision node?",
        "answer": "CLIP vision models are used similarly to how CLIP models encode text prompts; they are employed to encode images within the ComfyUI interface using the LoadCLIPVision node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage scenario involving the LoadCLIPVision node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves specifying a CLIP vision model by its name ('clip_name') and utilizing the resulting 'CLIP_VISION' model to encode image prompts, facilitating various image processing tasks within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadCLIPVision node integrate with other nodes or functionalities in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "It integrates by providing a specialized function to load CLIP vision models, enhancing ComfyUI's capability to process and manipulate images based on these models."
