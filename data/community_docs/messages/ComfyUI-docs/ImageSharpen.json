        "question": "What does the Image Sharpen node do?",
        "answer": "The Image Sharpen node applies a Laplacian sharpening filter to an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Image Sharpen node require?",
        "answer": "The inputs required by the Image Sharpen node are 'image' (the pixel image to be sharpened), 'sharpen_radius' (the radius of the sharpening kernel), 'sigma' (the sigma of the Gaussian, determining the concentration of the kernel on the center pixel), and 'alpha' (the strength of the sharpening kernel)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input refer to in the Image Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the Image Sharpen node refers to the pixel image that will undergo sharpening."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sharpen_radius' affect the sharpening process in the Image Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpen_radius' parameter in the Image Sharpen node determines the size of the sharpening kernel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does 'sigma' play in the Image Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "'Sigma' in the Image Sharpen node dictates how much the sharpening kernel focuses on the central pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'alpha' parameter in the Image Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "'Alpha' in the Image Sharpen node controls the strength or intensity of the applied sharpening kernel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Image Sharpen node provide?",
        "answer": "The Image Sharpen node outputs a sharpened pixel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage of the Image Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "An example usage of the Image Sharpen node involves applying a Laplacian sharpening filter to an input image, resulting in a sharpened output image."
