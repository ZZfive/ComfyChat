            "question": "What is the purpose of the VAE Encode node?",
            "answer": "The VAE Encode node is used to encode pixel space images into latent space images using a provided VAE (Variational Autoencoder)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What inputs does the VAE Encode node require?",
            "answer": "The VAE Encode node requires 'pixels', which are the pixel space images to be encoded, and 'vae', the VAE used for encoding these images."
        },
        {
            "question": "What outputs does the VAE Encode node produce?",
            "answer": "The VAE Encode node produces 'LATENT', which are the encoded latent images."
        },
        {
            "question": "Could you provide an example use case of the VAE Encode node?",
            "answer": "Sure, in tasks such as image to image transformations, pixel images need to be first encoded into latent space. For instance, the VAE Encode node can convert a pixel image into a latent image to enable operations like re-and de-noising."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the VAE Encode node contribute to image processing?",
            "answer": "The VAE Encode node facilitates the transformation of pixel space images into latent space representations, which is essential for tasks such as image enhancement and manipulation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What visual representation is associated with the VAE Encode node?",
            "answer": "The VAE Encode node is visually represented by an image of the node itself, typically shown in GUIs like ComfyUI."
        },
        {
            "question": "What role does the VAE play in conjunction with the VAE Encode node?",
            "answer": "The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) works together with the VAE Encode node to encode pixel images into latent space, enabling further processing and manipulation."
