        "question": "What is the purpose of the Load VAE node?",
        "answer": "The Load VAE node is used to load a specific VAE model, which is utilized for encoding and decoding images to and from latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required by the Load VAE node?",
        "answer": "The inputs required by the Load VAE node include the 'vae_name', which specifies the name of the VAE model to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'VAE' output from the Load VAE node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'VAE' output from the Load VAE node represents the VAE model used for encoding and decoding images in latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "When would you use the Load Checkpoint node instead of the Load VAE node?",
        "answer": "You would typically use the Load Checkpoint node instead of the Load VAE node when you need both a VAE model and a diffusion model loaded together."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is one example scenario for using a different VAE with the Load VAE node?",
        "answer": "One example scenario for using a different VAE with the Load VAE node is when you want to encode an image to latent space using a specific VAE model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the VAE model used in relation to images?",
        "answer": "The VAE model loaded by the Load VAE node is used to encode images into latent space representations and decode latent space vectors back into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What functionality does the Load VAE node extend in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load VAE node extends the functionality of ComfyUI by providing the capability to load and utilize custom VAE models for image encoding and decoding tasks."
