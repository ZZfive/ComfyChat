        "question": "What is the purpose of the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Latent node is used to resize latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What caution is mentioned regarding resizing latent images?",
        "answer": "Resizing latent images should not be done naively like pixel images to avoid introducing more artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required by the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Latent node requires inputs such as 'samples', 'upscale_method', 'Width', 'height', and 'crop'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'crop' do in the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "'crop' in the Upscale Latent node determines whether to center-crop the image to maintain the aspect ratio of the original latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Upscale Latent node is 'LATENT', which contains the resized latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe an example usage of the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "An example usage of the Upscale Latent node involves providing 'samples' as input and specifying the 'upscale_method', 'Width', 'height', and 'crop' parameters to resize latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there any warning associated with using the Upscale Latent node?",
        "answer": "Yes, there is a warning that resizing latent images naively can result in more artifacts compared to resizing pixel images."
