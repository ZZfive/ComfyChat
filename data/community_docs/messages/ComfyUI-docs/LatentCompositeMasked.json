        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Composite Masked node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Composite Masked node is used to paste a masked latent into another within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the inputs required for the Latent Composite Masked node?",
        "answer": "The inputs include 'destination', 'source', 'mask', 'x', and 'y'. 'destination' refers to the latents where the pasting occurs, 'source' refers to the latents being pasted, 'mask' is the mask for the 'source' latents, and 'x', 'y' are the coordinates where the 'source' latents are pasted in pixels."

    {
        "question": "What is the coordinate system origin in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The origin of the coordinate system in ComfyUI is at the top left corner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Latent Composite Masked node output?",
        "answer": "The output of the Latent Composite Masked node is a new latent composite containing the 'source' latents pasted into the 'destination' latents."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe how the Latent Composite Masked node works?",
        "answer": "The Latent Composite Masked node works by taking 'source' latents and pasting them into 'destination' latents, using a specified 'mask' to determine where the pasting occurs at coordinates ('x', 'y') within ComfyUI's coordinate system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where does the pasting occur when using the Latent Composite Masked node?",
        "answer": "The pasting occurs at the coordinates ('x', 'y') within the 'destination' latents specified in the Latent Composite Masked node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the coordinate system oriented in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the coordinate system is oriented with its origin at the top left corner."
