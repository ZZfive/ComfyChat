        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tome Patch Model node?",
        "answer": "The Tome Patch Model node applies Tome optimizations to the diffusion model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Tome (TOken MErging) affect the final image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Tome (TOken MErging) aims to merge prompt tokens in a way that minimally impacts the final image, resulting in faster generation times and reduced VRAM usage, though it may potentially reduce image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ratio' setting control in the Tome Patch Model node?",
        "answer": "The 'ratio' setting determines when tokens should be merged during Tome optimization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the Tome Patch Model node require?",
        "answer": "The Tome Patch Model node requires the diffusion model as input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Tome Patch Model node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Tome Patch Model node is the diffusion model optimized by Tome."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the tradeoff involved with using Tome optimizations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Using Tome optimizations in ComfyUI involves a tradeoff where merging more tokens (controlled by the 'ratio' setting) can lead to faster generation times and reduced VRAM usage, but may also result in a potential reduction in image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you provide an example of how the Tome Patch Model node is used?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves applying the Tome Patch Model node to optimize the diffusion model, resulting in improved performance and efficiency."
