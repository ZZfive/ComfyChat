        "question": "What is the Latent Composite node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Composite node is used to paste one latent into another."

        "question": "What inputs does the Latent Composite node take?",
        "answer": "The Latent Composite node takes inputs such as `samples_to`, `samples_from`, `x`, `y`, and `feather`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `samples_to` input refer to?",
        "answer": "`samples_to` refers to the latents to be pasted into."

        "question": "What does the `feather` input control?",
        "answer": "`feather` controls the feathering for the latents that are to be pasted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Latent Composite node output?",
        "answer": "The Latent Composite node outputs a new latent composite containing the `samples_from` pasted into `samples_to`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Could you describe an example usage of the Latent Composite node?",
        "answer": "An example usage involves using the Latent Composite node to create a new composite image where `samples_from` are pasted into `samples_to`, with specified coordinates and feathering."
