        "question": "What are the three major steps in the image generation process of Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "The three major steps in the image generation process of Stable Diffusion are: 1) Text Encoding, where the user-input prompt is compiled into individual word feature vectors. 2) In the Latent Space, these feature vectors and a random image are denoised into an intermediate product. 3) The intermediate product is decoded into a real image by the Image Decoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the Text Encoder in Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "The Text Encoder compiles the user-input prompt into individual word feature vectors. These vectors are 77 equally long, each containing 768 dimensions, essentially converting text into numbers that machines can recognize."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the concept of 'denoising' important in Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "The concept of 'denoising' is crucial in Stable Diffusion because it involves removing unnecessary noise from a random image in the Latent Space based on the feature vectors of the prompt. This process progressively refines the image to match the command given by the user."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Latent Space facilitate image generation in Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "The Latent Space in Stable Diffusion enables efficiency in image generation by encoding the image into a set of numbers and compressing these numbers, allowing for the extraction of crucial features and structure from the data. This operation is more efficient than direct image manipulations and allows for fine control over the details of the generated images."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the Text Encoder's output in Stable Diffusion's image generation?",
        "answer": "The output of the Text Encoder, which is 77 equal-length vectors each containing 768 dimensions, carries features and meanings related to the input text. These vectors guide the 'denoising' process in the Latent Space, influencing the outcome of the generated image, such as the morphology, visual features, and semantic meanings of the subject."
