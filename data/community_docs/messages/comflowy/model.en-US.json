        "question": "What are the differences between Stable Diffusion v1.5, v2.0, and XL?",
        "answer": "Stable Diffusion v1.5 is an early version with many Lora and ContrlNet models based on it, recommended for beginners. v2.0 has improved image generation quality and speed, adopting a new text encoder (OpenCLIP) for better text prompt understanding and supports higher image resolution. Stable Diffusion XL is the latest version, with a larger model size, 6.6B parameters, providing higher quality images, more artistic and realistic images, and better readable fonts."

    {
        "question": "Why is CivitAI preferred for downloading models for ComfyUI over HuggingFace?",
        "answer": "CivitAI is preferred for downloading models for ComfyUI over HuggingFace because it leans more towards UGC, offering many personally trained models and has more filters and useful functions, although it does not necessarily mean the quality will be poorer."

        "question": "How do you add models to the ComfyUI project folder if SD WebUI is not installed?",
        "answer": "If SD WebUI is not installed, to add models to the ComfyUI project folder, open the ComfyUI project folder, navigate to the 'models' directory, and place the downloaded model in the appropriate folder, such as the 'checkpoints' folder for the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What steps are involved in adding models to ComfyUI if SD WebUI is already installed?",
        "answer": "If SD WebUI is already installed, to add models to ComfyUI, open the ComfyUI project folder, rename the `extra_model_paths.yaml.example` file to `extra_model_paths.yaml`, open it with VSCode, and modify the `base_path` key with the path to your SD webui directory."
