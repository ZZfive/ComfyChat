        "question": "What is the primary difference between Comflowy Cloud and the open-source offline version?",
        "answer": "The primary differences between Comflowy Cloud and the open-source offline version are that users handle installation issues themselves with the offline version, while the cloud version is ready to use immediately, and the cloud version uses high-performance GPUs which offer faster image generation but at a cost, whereas the offline open-source version is free."

    {
        "question": "What factors should be considered when deciding between the local version and Comflowy Cloud for image generation?",
        "answer": "The decision between the local version and Comflowy Cloud for image generation should be based on your computer's specifications, your tolerance for technical difficulties, and the comparison of local image generation speeds to those of Comflowy Cloud. If your local setup is faster, there is no need to use the cloud version."

    {
        "question": "Why might a higher-spec GPU like the A100 not always generate images faster than lower-spec GPUs?",
        "answer": "A higher-spec GPU like the A100 might not always generate images faster because it may require queuing due to popularity, leading to a longer startup time. Additionally, for tasks like generating SD1.5 images that do not fully utilize its capabilities, its overall image generation speed might not be significantly faster than that of a lower-spec GPU."

    {
        "question": "Which GPU would be recommended for video generation workflows in Comflowy Cloud?",
        "answer": "For video generation workflows in Comflowy Cloud, an A100 GPU is recommended due to the workflow's requirement for more GPU computing resources, resulting in the A100's performance shining through with faster processing speeds, even surpassing a local RTX 4090."
