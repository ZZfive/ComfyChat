        "question": "What is the purpose of upscale in AI-based image generation with ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Upscale in ComfyUI is used to transform low-resolution images into high-definition ones using different methods and algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two mainstream methods of upscaling in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The two mainstream methods of upscaling in ComfyUI are Upscale pixel and Upscale latent. Upscale pixel directly upscales the visible image, while Upscale latent upscales the invisible latent space image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the commonly used algorithms for upsampling images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Commonly used algorithms for upsampling images in ComfyUI include Bicubic interpolation, Lanczos interpolation, and models trained based on neural networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models are recommended for use with the Upscale Image (using Model) method in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Models recommended for use with the Upscale Image (using Model) method in ComfyUI include Real-ESRGAN, Swin2SR, and BSRGAN. They are particularly effective for restoring scenery images and offer good results for real images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a Hi-res fix latent upscale workflow in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "A Hi-res fix latent upscale workflow in ComfyUI involves connecting the VAE Decode node with the Upscale Image node to directly upscale the image in the latent space."
