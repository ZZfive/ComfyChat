        "question": "What is the Negative Hand embedding in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Negative Hand embedding is a specific model used for optimizing hand representations in generated figures, ensuring that the addition of Negative Prompt Embedding does not alter the overall style of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the key reasons for recommending the Negative Hand embedding?",
        "answer": "The Negative Hand embedding is recommended because it has specific optimizations for hands in figures and it won't cause a change in the image style due to the addition of Negative Prompt Embedding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Negative Hand prevent style changes in generated images?",
        "answer": "The Negative Hand embedding is designed to optimize hand representations without altering the style of the generated images, unlike some other Negative Embeddings which can change the style while improving image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use the Negative Hand embedding in your prompts?",
        "answer": "To use the Negative Hand embedding, simply enter 'embedding:negative_hands' in the Negative Prompt. If you want to adjust the weight, you can add a value after the embedding, for example, 'embedding:negative_hands:0.5'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of content does the Negative Hand embedding specialize in?",
        "answer": "The Negative Hand embedding specializes in generating portraits of real people and anime-style content."
