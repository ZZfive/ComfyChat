        "question": "What is ControlNet in the context of Stable Diffusion?",
        "answer": "ControlNet is a feature in Stable Diffusion that allows users to control the construction of the graph for better results in AI image generation, using various forms of structural information such as sketches, masks, or edge information to influence the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models are required to be placed within the models/controlnet folder in ComfyUI for using ControlNet?",
        "answer": "The required models are ControlNet Scribble, ControlNet Openpose, and ControlNet Canny. These should be placed within the models/controlnet folder in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is responsible for applying the ControlNet feature to an image?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet node is responsible for applying the ControlNet feature to an image in ComfyUI, controlling the image generation based on the structural information provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ControlNet assist in generating images that follow specific poses?",
        "answer": "ControlNet assists in generating images according to specific poses by converting input images into pose representations through Openpose or other similar methods, which are then provided to the ControlNet model to influence the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'strength' value in the Apply ControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' value in the Apply ControlNet node represents the influence strength of ControlNet on the final image. A higher value indicates that the generated image will more closely resemble the input structural diagram or prompt provided to ControlNet."
