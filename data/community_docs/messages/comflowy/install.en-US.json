        "question": "What are the two methods for installing ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The two methods for installing ComfyUI are installing on local and installing in the cloud. Installing on local allows you to run ComfyUI locally on your own computer, which is cost-effective but can be slower if your GPU configuration is poor. Installing in the cloud offers faster image generation due to higher configurations but requires a certain cost."

        "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of local installation of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The advantages of local installation of ComfyUI include almost cost-free operation since it runs on your own computer. However, if your computer's GPU configuration is relatively poor, the speed of generating images can be slower compared to cloud installation."

    {
        "question": "What steps are involved in the command line installation of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The command line installation of ComfyUI involves four main steps: installing Pytorch, downloading ComfyUI, installing dependencies, and starting the service. For Pytorch installation, different commands are required for Windows and Mac users. After installing Pytorch, the ComfyUI code is pulled locally through Git or Github Desktop. Then, dependencies are installed via requirements.txt in the Visual Studio Code terminal or the system terminal. Finally, the service is launched with the main.py file."

    {
        "question": "How can you fix issues with downloading content in the terminal command line during ComfyUI installation?",
        "answer": "If you can't download content in the terminal command line during ComfyUI installation, it's likely due to your network not being configured to bypass the firewall. To address this, you need to properly configure the proxy in the terminal by setting up the https_proxy, http_proxy, and all_proxy variables with your specific ports, depending on your bypass service."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the solution if the terminal displays \"ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pyyaml\" during ComfyUI installation?",
        "answer": "If the terminal displays an error message about not finding a version that satisfies the requirement for pyyaml during ComfyUI installation, this is due to the lack of the pyyaml module. You can resolve this by installing pyyaml using the command `pip install pyyaml` and then proceed to continue installing ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should you do if you encounter pip installation errors during the dependency installation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "If you encounter errors with pip installation during the dependency installation for ComfyUI, you can try using `pip3` instead by entering `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal. This will install the necessary dependencies that are listed in the requirements.txt file."
