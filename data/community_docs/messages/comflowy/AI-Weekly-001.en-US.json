        "question": "What is the purpose of the Empty latent image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Empty latent image node in ComfyUI is used for directly adjusting the size of the output image, but it may not always produce good results, especially when the model training size does not match the requested size."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the Upscale latent node necessary in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Upscale latent node in ComfyUI is necessary when the direct adjustment of image size using the Empty latent image node results in poor quality output, as it is specifically good at proportional upsizing and can add content details while enlarging the image."
