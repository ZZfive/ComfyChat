        "question": "What is the purpose of the imageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node is designed to extract and provide the dimensions of an image, focusing on width and height as key attributes, serving as a fundamental tool in image processing for subsequent analysis and operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the imageSize node require?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node requires an 'image' parameter, essential for deriving the width and height values, as the node cannot perform its primary function without it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'image' input in imageSize need to conform to?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in imageSize should conform to the ComfyUI dtype: IMAGE, and in Python, it should be either PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width_int' output represent in the context of the imageSize node?",
        "answer": "The 'width_int' output in the imageSize node represents the horizontal dimension of the input image, providing critical information for further image-related operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way is 'height_int' significant for image processing tasks when using imageSize?",
        "answer": "The 'height_int' output from imageSize signifies the vertical dimension of the input image, which is essential for understanding the image structure and crucial for subsequent image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which hardware type is the imageSize node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The imageSize node is optimized for use on the CPU infrastructure, as specified in the usage tips."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the imageSize node handle images where width or height is undefined?",
        "answer": "If the width or height of the image is not defined, the imageSize node returns a tuple with values (0, 0) for width and height respectively, ensuring the node's robustness and error handling."
