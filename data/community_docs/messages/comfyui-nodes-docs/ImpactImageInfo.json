        "question": "What is the ImpactImageInfo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImpactImageInfo is a node part of the ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test category within ComfyUI, designed to provide crucial image information including batch size, height, width, and number of channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the output parameters 'batch', 'height', 'width', and 'channel' of the ImpactImageInfo node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'batch' parameter represents the number of images processed in a single batch. 'Height' and 'width' indicate the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the input image, respectively. 'Channel' refers to the number of color components in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type is required for the ImpactImageInfo node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input type is required for the ImpactImageInfo node; it represents the image data that the node processes to output information about its dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'doit' method of the ImpactImageInfo node do?",
        "answer": "The 'doit' method of the ImpactImageInfo node is responsible for extracting and returning the dimensions of the input image including batch size, height, width, and channel count."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which types do the ImpactImageInfo node return the extracted image dimensions?",
        "answer": "The ImpactImageInfo node returns the 'batch', 'height', 'width', and 'channel' dimensions in ComfyUI as 'INT' types, corresponding to 'int' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data types are used for the output parameters of the ImpactImageInfo node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types used for the output parameters of the ImpactImageInfo node are 'int' for all 'batch', 'height', 'width', and 'channel'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What computational type does the ImpactImageInfo node utilize?",
        "answer": "The ImpactImageInfo node utilizes CPU as its infra type for computation."
