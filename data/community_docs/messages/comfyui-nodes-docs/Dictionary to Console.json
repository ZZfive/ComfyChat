        "question": "What is the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node?",
        "answer": "WAS_Dictionary_To_Console is a node in ComfyUI designed to facilitate the debugging process by outputting the content of a dictionary to the console, enhancing data visibility for easier review and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dictionary' parameter represent in the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node?",
        "answer": "The 'dictionary' parameter represents the data structure that is critical for the node's operation, as it contains the information that will be printed to the console for debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of data are accepted as input by the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node?",
        "answer": "The node accepts 'dictionary' of type DICT and an optional 'label' of type STRING as input, where the dictionary is mandatory for the node's function and the label adds a descriptive header to the console output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'label' parameter enhance the use of WAS_Dictionary_To_Console for debugging?",
        "answer": "The 'label' parameter, although optional, enhances clarity in the console output when debugging multiple dictionaries by providing a descriptive title for each output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node?",
        "answer": "The output of the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node is the original dictionary that was passed into it, enabling further processing or debugging while keeping the data available within the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what context is the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node most effectively used?",
        "answer": "WAS_Dictionary_To_Console is most effectively used when debugging code in ComfyUI, particularly when it is necessary to review the structure and values of dictionaries in a more readable format on the console."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node be used without any optional inputs?",
        "answer": "Yes, the WAS_Dictionary_To_Console node can be used without the optional 'label' input, in which case it will still output the dictionary to the console with a default title or without any title, focusing solely on the data."
