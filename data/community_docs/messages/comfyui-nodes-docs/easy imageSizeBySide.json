        "question": "What is the imageSizeBySide node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The imageSizeBySide node is a part of the EasyUse/Image category in ComfyUI, designed to categorize images based on the specified edge length and provide a simplified resolution value based on the user's preference for the longer or shorter edge of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input represent in the imageSizeBySide node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input is a mandatory parameter in the imageSizeBySide node. It represents the image that will be evaluated and compared against the specified edge length to determine the processing outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'side' input parameter in the imageSizeBySide node?",
        "answer": "The 'side' input parameter in the imageSizeBySide node is crucial as it determines the standard for resolution assessment, focusing either on the longest or shortest edge of the image, significantly impacting the node's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution output work in the imageSizeBySide node?",
        "answer": "The resolution output of the imageSizeBySide node provides a single integer value that represents the dimension of the image based on the selected edge parameter. This value is the core result of the node operation, summarizing the size of the image according to user preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can classify images based on edge lengths in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the imageSizeBySide node is capable of classifying images based on the specified edge length. It belongs to the EasyUse/Image category and simplifies the resolution value based on the longer or shorter edge of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the imageSizeBySide node be used on CPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the imageSizeBySide node can be used on a CPU infrastructure as per the documented 'Infra type: CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category of ComfyUI can the imageSizeBySide node be found?",
        "answer": "The imageSizeBySide node can be found in the 'EasyUse/Image' category of ComfyUI, indicating its role in simplifying image processing tasks related to adjusting image sizes based on edge preference."
