        "question": "What does the ImpactIfNone node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactIfNone node in ComfyUI's ImpactPack/Logic category is designed to evaluate the presence of input, returning the input itself along with a boolean indicating whether the input was provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'signal' parameter in the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' parameter in ImpactIfNone is an optional input of any type which represents the data whose presence the node assesses. It is crucial as the subject of the node's conditional logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'any_input' parameter affect the operation of the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The 'any_input' parameter, another optional input of any type, triggers the node's operation or provides additional context to the 'signal' parameter. Its presence directly influences the node's decision-making process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'bool' output provide?",
        "answer": "The 'bool' output is a boolean value indicating the presence of the 'any_input' parameter. It serves as a clear indicator for downstream operations on whether to proceed based on the availability of input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'signal_opt' output represent in ImpactIfNone?",
        "answer": "The 'signal_opt' output represents the evaluated input, indicating whether data was determined to be present or absent based on the ImpactIfNone node's logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactIfNone node is recommended to be used on CPU infrastructure, as noted in the usage tips."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactIfNone node behave when 'any_input' is not provided?",
        "answer": "When 'any_input' is not provided to the ImpactIfNone node, it returns the 'signal' value paired with a boolean False, indicating the absence of 'any_input'."
