        "question": "What does the VHS_GetMaskCount node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetMaskCount node in ComfyUI is designed to count the number of masks in a given batch, providing a straightforward way to quantify the number of mask elements for operations that require knowledge of batch size or element count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the node used for getting the mask count?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node used for getting the mask count is `VHS_GetMaskCount`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of the VHS_GetMaskCount in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node of the VHS_GetMaskCount node in ComfyUI is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does VHS_GetMaskCount belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "VHS_GetMaskCount belongs to the category `Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/mask` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the VHS_GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetMaskCount node requires `mask` as input, which represents the batch of masks for which the count is to be determined, and its dtype is `MASK`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mask` parameter represent in the context of the VHS_GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "In the context of the VHS_GetMaskCount node, the `mask` parameter represents the batch of masks that needs to be counted, and understanding its size is crucial for operations or adjustments based on the batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VHS_GetMaskCount node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VHS_GetMaskCount node is `count`, which represents the total number of masks in the input batch, and its dtype is `INT`."
