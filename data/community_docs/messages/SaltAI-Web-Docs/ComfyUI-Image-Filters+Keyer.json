        "question": "What is the Keyer node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Keyer node in ComfyUI is designed for image processing, specifically to apply keying operations that selectively adjust the transparency of image areas based on color and brightness criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of image processing does Keyer focus on?",
        "answer": "Keyer focuses on sophisticated manipulation of images, enabling the creation or modification of alpha channels to achieve effects like background removal or compositing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Keyer node?",
        "answer": "The Keyer node outputs processed images with adjusted transparency, an alpha channel representing the transparency levels, and a mask indicating areas of transparency and opacity within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs determine the transparency of the processed images in Keyer?",
        "answer": "The `low`, `high`, and `gamma` inputs determine the transparency of the processed images in Keyer by setting the thresholds for pixels to be considered transparent and adjusting the gamma value for mid-tone contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can be specified by the `operation` input in the Keyer node?",
        "answer": "The `operation` input specifies the keying operation to be performed, including luminance, saturation, max, min, red, green, blue, redscreen, greenscreen, or bluescreen."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `premult` input affect the output of Keyer?",
        "answer": "The `premult` input determines whether the output images from Keyer should be pre-multiplied with their alpha channel, affecting the blending behavior in compositing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` input represent in the Keyer node?",
        "answer": "The `images` input represents the images to be processed in Keyer, serving as the primary input for keying operations, and it is crucial for defining which images undergo the keying process."
