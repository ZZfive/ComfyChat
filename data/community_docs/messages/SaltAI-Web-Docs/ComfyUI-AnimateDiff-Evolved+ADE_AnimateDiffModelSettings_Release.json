        "question": "What is ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release is a node designed to configure motion model settings for the AnimateDiff process, focusing on adjusting advanced attention strengths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "The purpose of ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release is to fine-tune the animation effects applied through the AnimateDiff framework by configuring motion model settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release include min_motion_scale and max_motion_scale. min_motion_scale specifies the minimum scale for motion, while max_motion_scale defines the maximum scale for motion intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does min_motion_scale define in ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "In ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release, min_motion_scale specifies the minimum scale for motion, influencing the subtlety or intensity of the animation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does max_motion_scale define in ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "In ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release, max_motion_scale defines the maximum scale for motion, affecting the range of motion intensity that can be applied to the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type in ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "The optional input type in ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release is mask_motion_scale, which is a mask tensor allowing fine-tuned control over motion scaling across different regions of the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output ad_settings represent in ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release?",
        "answer": "In ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings_Release, the output ad_settings represents a configuration set for the AnimateDiff model, encapsulating adjustments to motion scales and potentially other parameters."
