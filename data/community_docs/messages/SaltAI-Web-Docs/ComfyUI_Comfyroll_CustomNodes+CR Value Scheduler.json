        "question": "What is the CR Value Scheduler node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Scheduler node in ComfyUI is designed to manage the scheduling of numerical values across different frames in an animation sequence, allowing for dynamic adjustment of values based on a predefined schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CR Value Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CR Value Scheduler node include `mode`, `current_frame`, `schedule_alias`, `default_value`, and `schedule_format`. These inputs are used to determine the operation mode, frame number, schedule identifier, fallback value, and schedule format, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Value Scheduler node convert scheduled values for output?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Scheduler node converts scheduled values to two different formats for output: `INT` and `FLOAT`. The `INT` output is the scheduled value converted to an integer, while the `FLOAT` output is the scheduled value in its original floating-point format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the behavior of the CR Value Scheduler node when the schedule is disabled?",
        "answer": "When the `mode` input is set to 'Default Value', the CR Value Scheduler node is disabled or an appropriate scheduled value cannot be found, it will use the `default_value` input as the fallback value for the current frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CR Value Scheduler node handle multiple schedules?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CR Value Scheduler node can handle multiple schedules through the use of a unique identifier called `schedule_alias`. This facilitates the management and reference of multiple schedules within the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `show_help` output from the CR Value Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output from the CR Value Scheduler node provides a URL where users can access additional information and guidance on using the CR Value Scheduler node effectively. This can help users understand how to configure and use the node in their animation projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of schedule does the CR Value Scheduler node work with?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Scheduler node works with a frame-wise schedule. It applies a predefined schedule to adjust numerical values based on the current frame in the animation sequence. This allows for dynamic changes in values over time as the animation progresses."
