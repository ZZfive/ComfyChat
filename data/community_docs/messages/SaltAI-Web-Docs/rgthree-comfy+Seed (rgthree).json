        "question": "What is the Seed node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and generate random seeds for operations, ensuring reproducibility and uniqueness in processes that require randomization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of seeds can the Seed node in ComfyUI return?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI can return a predefined seed, generate a new random seed, or modify the seed based on specific conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the seed parameter utilized in the Seed node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the Seed node of ComfyUI is crucial for determining the starting point of randomness. It can either use a predefined seed or trigger the generation of a new random seed, affecting the node's output and ensuring reproducibility of results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Seed node in ComfyUI provide?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI outputs the seed used or generated during the node's execution, which is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of the randomness in processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the seed value is set to -1 in the Seed node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "When the seed value is set to -1 in the Seed node of ComfyUI, a server-generated random seed is used, and this new seed is saved to the workflow's metadata if certain conditions are met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that use the Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that use the Seed node in ComfyUI include KSampler, PhotoMaker_Generation, KSampler Adv. (Efficient), and OneButtonPrompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the RgthreeSeed class in the Seed node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RgthreeSeed class in the Seed node of ComfyUI is responsible for handling the input seed and generating or returning a seed as part of the node's operation."
