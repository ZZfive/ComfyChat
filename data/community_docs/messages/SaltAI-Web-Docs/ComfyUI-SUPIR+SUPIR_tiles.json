        "question": "What is the SUPIR_tiles node designed for in the ComfyUI framework?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_tiles node is designed for tiling images, dividing a large image into smaller, manageable pieces, within the SUPIR framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SUPIR_tiles node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SUPIR_tiles node are the input image, tile_size, and tile_stride, with dtypes `IMAGE`, `INT`, and `INT`, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the tile_size parameter in SUPIR_tiles determine the image processing?",
        "answer": "The tile_size parameter in SUPIPIR_tiles determines how the image is segmented into tiles, impacting the number of tiles generated and the resolution of each tile."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SUPIR_tiles node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SUPIR_tiles node are image_tiles, tile_size, and tile_stride, with dtypes `IMAGE`, `INT`, and `INT`, respectively, representing the segmented tiles and tiling parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does tile_stride play in the SUPIR_tiles node's operation?",
        "answer": "The tile_stride in SUPIR_tiles affects how tiles are overlapped or spaced apart, impacting the coverage and redundancy of the tiling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What functionality does SUPIR_tiles support for the image tiles it generates?",
        "answer": "SUPIR_tiles supports operations such as previewing the tiling effect and potentially generating captions for each tile."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SUPIR_tiles node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_tiles node is classified in the category 'SUPIR' within ComfyUI."
