        "question": "What is the purpose of the ThresholdMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ThresholdMask node in ComfyUI is designed to convert an image into a binary mask based on a specified threshold value, facilitating image segmentation or object detection tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ThresholdMask node are 'mask' (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and 'value' (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ThresholdMask node classify pixels when creating the binary mask?",
        "answer": "The ThresholdMask node classifies pixels based on the 'value' parameter. Pixels with values above this threshold will be considered part of the mask, influencing the binary segmentation outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ThresholdMask node and its data type?",
        "answer": "The output of the ThresholdMask node is a binary mask where pixels above the threshold are marked. This output has a Comfy dtype of MASK and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mask' parameter in the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the ThresholdMask node represents the input image to be thresholded, which is crucial for determining which pixels will be included in the output mask based on the threshold value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines if a pixel is included in the output mask of the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "A pixel is included in the output mask of the ThresholdMask node if its value is above the 'value' parameter, which sets the threshold for the conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'value' parameter in the ThresholdMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter in the ThresholdMask node sets the threshold for the conversion process. It determines which pixels will be considered part of the binary mask, influencing the segmentation outcome."
