        "question": "What is the CR XY Index node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Index node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate the X and Y positions in a grid based on a given index, facilitating the organization and navigation of elements within a grid structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the X Columns field specify in the CR XY Index node?",
        "answer": "The X Columns field in the CR XY Index node specifies the number of columns in the grid, which determines how the index is translated into the X coordinate, affecting the grid's horizontal layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in CR XY Index determines the grid's vertical structure?",
        "answer": "The Y Rows input type in CR XY Index defines the number of rows in the grid, influencing the calculation of the Y coordinate from the index, impacting the grid's vertical structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Index input represent in the CR XY Index node?",
        "answer": "The Index input in the CR XY Index node represents the linear index to be converted into X and Y coordinates, which helps in locating a specific element within the grid structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type for the X coordinate in the CR XY Index node?",
        "answer": "The X coordinate output data type in the CR XY Index node is INT, representing the calculated X coordinate in the grid, derived from the provided index."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the Y coordinate calculated in the CR XY Index node?",
        "answer": "The Y coordinate in the CR XY Index node is calculated based on the index and the grid dimensions by dividing the index by the number of X columns and converting the result to an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can detailed information and guidance on using the CR XY Index node be found?",
        "answer": "Detailed information and guidance on using the CR XY Index node can be found at the URL provided in the 'show_help' output, 'https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/XY-Grid-Nodes#cr-xy-index'."
