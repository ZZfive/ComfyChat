        "question": "What is the WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to process input prompts by interpreting and replacing wildcard syntax and handling specific syntax for interacting with large language models (LLMs) through the OobaPrompt class."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter is crucial for determining the final output in the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_prompt' parameter is crucial for determining the final output in the WildcardOobaPrompt node, as it guides the node on how to transform the input prompt by containing wildcard syntax for dynamic content insertion and specific markers for LLM syntax processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter affect the execution of the WildcardOobaPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter affects the execution of the WildcardOobaPrompt node by initializing the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility in selections made during the wildcard and random word selection processes, thus influencing the randomness of content insertion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the WildcardOobaPrompt node provide?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node outputs a transformed version of the input prompt with wildcard syntax and LLM markers processed and replaced according to the provided rules and parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'search_and_replace' function in the WildcardOobaPrompt source code?",
        "answer": "The 'search_and_replace' function in the WildcardOobaPrompt source code is used to search and replace wildcard syntax and LLM markers in the input prompt according to the provided rules and parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WildcardOobaPrompt node handle LLM syntax in the prompt?",
        "answer": "The WildcardOobaPrompt node handles LLM syntax in the prompt by processing wildcards, checking if LLM syntax is in the prompt, and replacing the LLM syntax markers with the result of the corresponding API request if present."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name and category of the WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the WildcardOobaPrompt node in ComfyUI is 'WildcardOobaPrompt', and it belongs to the 'Mikey/AI' category."
