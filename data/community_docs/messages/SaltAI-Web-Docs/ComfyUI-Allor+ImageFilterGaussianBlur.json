        "question": "What is ImageFilterGaussianBlur?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlur is a node in ComfyUI that applies a Gaussian blur filter to images, smoothing out image noise and details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageFilterGaussianBlur do?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlur applies a Gaussian blur filter to images, which effectively reduces image noise and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageFilterGaussianBlur?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlur requires inputs such as 'images', 'size_x', and 'size_y'. 'images' specify the images to be processed, while 'size_x' and 'size_y' determine the extent of horizontal and vertical blurring respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ImageFilterGaussianBlur?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageFilterGaussianBlur is an image, which is the result of applying the Gaussian blur filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageFilterGaussianBlur affect images?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlur affects images by smoothing them with a Gaussian blur filter, simulating the effect of viewing the image through a translucent screen."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for 'size_x' in ImageFilterGaussianBlur?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for 'size_x' in ImageFilterGaussianBlur is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is ImageFilterGaussianBlur suitable for processing images to reduce noise?",
        "answer": "Yes, ImageFilterGaussianBlur is suitable for processing images to reduce noise by applying a Gaussian blur filter."
