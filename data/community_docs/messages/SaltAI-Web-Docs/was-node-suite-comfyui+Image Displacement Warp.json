        "question": "What class is used for applying a displacement warp effect to images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class used for applying a displacement warp effect to images in ComfyUI is `WAS_Image_Displacement_Warp`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `Image Displacement Warp` node adjust?",
        "answer": "The `Image Displacement Warp` node in ComfyUI adjusts the positions of pixels in the original image according to the displacement values from the displacement map, creating a visually distorted version that simulates physical displacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `displacement_maps` input in the `Image Displacement Warp` node?",
        "answer": "The `displacement_maps` input in the `Image Displacement Warp` node represents grayscale images where each pixel's intensity indicates the displacement amount for the corresponding pixel in the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `amplitude` value affect the displacement warp effect in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `amplitude` value in the `Image Displacement Warp` node scales the displacement effect, with higher values resulting in more pronounced displacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is `Image Displacement Warp` categorized as in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, `Image Displacement Warp` is categorized as a Transform node under the category `WAS Suite/Image/Transform`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to simulate the physical displacement of an image?",
        "answer": "The `Image Displacement Warp` node in ComfyUI can be used to simulate the physical displacement of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the `Image Displacement Warp` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the `Image Displacement Warp` node in ComfyUI is the resulting images after applying the displacement warp effect, with the dtype `IMAGE`."
