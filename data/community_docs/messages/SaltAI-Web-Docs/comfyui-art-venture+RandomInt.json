        "question": "What is the purpose of the RandomInt node?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node generates a random integer within a specified range, simplifying the process of random number generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the RandomInt node belong to?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node belongs to the 'Art Venture/Utils' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RandomInt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RandomInt node are 'min' and 'max', both of which are of type 'INT' in Comfy and 'int' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RandomInt node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the RandomInt node include 'INT', which is both a Comfy dtype and a Python dtype, and 'STRING', which represents the generated random integer as a string."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RandomInt node handle the range for random integer generation?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node uses the 'min' and 'max' parameters to define the range within which the random integer is generated. It ensures that the generated number is within this specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python library does the RandomInt node utilize for random number generation?",
        "answer": "The RandomInt node utilizes the torch library in Python for random number generation, specifically using torch.randint(min, max, (1,)).item()."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name associated with the RandomInt node?",
        "answer": "The function name associated with the RandomInt node is 'random_int'."
