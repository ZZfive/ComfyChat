        "question": "What is the HED Preprocessor Provider (SEGS) node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HED Preprocessor Provider (SEGS) node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images by detecting edges using the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) algorithm, enhancing the input specifically for SEGS (semantic edge guided synthesis) applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `safe` represent in the HED Preprocessor Provider (SEGS) node?",
        "answer": "`safe` in the HED Preprocessor Provider (SEGS) node determines whether the preprocessing should be performed in a safe mode, potentially affecting how the edge detection is handled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is a preprocessed object of type `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`, specifically tailored for use in SEGS applications with edge detection enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the input `safe` in the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the input `safe` in the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node is `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `segs_preprocessor` represent in the context of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node?",
        "answer": "`segs_preprocessor` is the output type of the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node, which represents a ready-to-use preprocessed object specifically designed for SEGS applications, focusing on edge detection enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which algorithm is used by HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS to preprocess images for SEGS?",
        "answer": "HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS uses the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) algorithm to preprocess images, focusing on edge detection for SEGS applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS node belongs to the 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' category in ComfyUI."
