        "question": "What is the purpose of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI provides a mechanism to switch between two conditioning inputs based on a boolean value, effectively allowing conditional logic to be applied to the flow of conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Switch conditioning node in ComfyUI is Switch conditioning [Crystools]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types of the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The required input types of the Switch conditioning node are on_true (CONDITIONING), on_false (CONDITIONING), and boolean (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the on_true input of the Switch conditioning node represent?",
        "answer": "The on_true input of the Switch conditioning node represents the conditioning to be used if the boolean value is true, determining the flow of data when the condition is met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Switch conditioning node is conditioning (CONDITIONING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean value is true in the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean value is true in the Switch conditioning node, the on_true input is used for the conditioning output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean value is false in the Switch conditioning node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean value is false in the Switch conditioning node, the on_false input is used for the conditioning output."
