        "question": "What is the SAMPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to segment images using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) method. It preprocesses images to enhance them for further processing or analysis, specifically for segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SAMPreprocessor node is the image, which is the primary data the node operates on, aiming to identify and segment various elements within."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input represent in the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in the SAMPreprocessor node represents the input image to be segmented. This is the primary data the SAMPreprocessor operates on, aiming to identify and segment various elements within."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input does the SAMPreprocessor node have?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SAMPreprocessor node is `resolution`, which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing. This parameter can influence the segmentation accuracy and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SAMPreprocessor node is `IMAGE`, which is a segmented version of the input image, where different segments are identified and separated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SAMPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is `SAMPreprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the SAMPreprocessor node is `GPU`."
