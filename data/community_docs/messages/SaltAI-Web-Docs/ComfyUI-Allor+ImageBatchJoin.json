        "question": "What is ImageBatchJoin?",
        "answer": "ImageBatchJoin is a node in ComfyUI designed for concatenating two batches of images along the batch dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of ImageBatchJoin?",
        "answer": "The purpose of ImageBatchJoin is to combine image data from different sources or processing stages into a single batch for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for ImageBatchJoin?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for ImageBatchJoin are 'images_a' and 'images_b', which are batches of images to be concatenated. These images must have matching dimensions for successful concatenation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ImageBatchJoin?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageBatchJoin is an image batch, combining 'images_a' and 'images_b' along the batch dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageBatchJoin handle image dimensions?",
        "answer": "ImageBatchJoin checks that the height, width, and channels of 'images_a' and 'images_b' match before concatenating them along the batch dimension. It raises errors if these dimensions do not match."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should be done if the dimensions of 'images_a' and 'images_b' do not match?",
        "answer": "If the dimensions of 'images_a' and 'images_b' do not match, you can use ImageTransformResize to ensure compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for ImageBatchJoin?",
        "answer": "ImageBatchJoin is recommended for use with GPU infrastructure."
