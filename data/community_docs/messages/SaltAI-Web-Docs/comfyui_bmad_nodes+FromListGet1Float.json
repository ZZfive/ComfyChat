        "question": "What is the purpose of the `FromListGet1Float` node?",
        "answer": "The `FromListGet1Float` node is designed to retrieve a single float value from a list based on a specified index, allowing for random access within the list including the use of negative indices for reverse access."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the `FromListGet1Float` node belong?",
        "answer": "The `FromListGet1Float` node belongs to the category `Bmad/Lists/Get1`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the `FromListGet1Float` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `FromListGet1Float` node are `list` and `index`. The `list` parameter is the source list from which a float value is to be retrieved. The `index` parameter specifies the index at which the float value is to be retrieved from the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type generated by the `FromListGet1Float` node?",
        "answer": "The output type generated by the `FromListGet1Float` node is of dtype `FLOAT` which represents a single float value retrieved from the specified index in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the numpy dtype equivalent for the `FromListGet1Float` node's output?",
        "answer": "The numpy dtype equivalent for the `FromListGet1Float` node's output is `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the `FromListGet1Float` node use negative indices for accessing elements?",
        "answer": "Yes, the `FromListGet1Float` node supports negative indexing for reverse access, enhancing flexibility in data manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the `FromListGet1Float` node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the `FromListGet1Float` node is `CPU`."
