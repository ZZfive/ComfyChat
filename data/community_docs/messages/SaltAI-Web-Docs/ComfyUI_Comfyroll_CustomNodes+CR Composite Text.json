        "question": "What is the CR Composite Text node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Composite Text node is designed for the advanced manipulation and combination of text elements within images, enabling users to create complex text overlays and compositions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters are essential for the CR Composite Text node to integrate text with images?",
        "answer": "The essential parameters are `image_text`, `image_background`, and `text`. `image_text` is the image onto which the text will be composited, `image_background` is the background image over which the text and foreground image will be composited, and `text` is the primary text content to be composited onto the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Composite Text node allow for precise control over text positioning?",
        "answer": "The node provides control over text positioning through `position_x` and `position_y` parameters, which specify the x and y coordinates for the position of the text within the image, enabling precise placement."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the CR Composite Text node are used to control text rotation?",
        "answer": "The `rotation_angle` and `rotation_options` parameters are used to control text rotation. `rotation_angle` defines the angle at which the text will be rotated, while `rotation_options` provides additional options for text rotation, such as the point around which the text should rotate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Composite Text node?",
        "answer": "The CR Composite Text node outputs `IMAGE`, which is the resulting image after the text has been composited onto it, and `show_help`, which provides optional help or guidance related to the node's functionality or output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CR Composite Text node affects the visual appearance of the text element within the composition?",
        "answer": "The `font_name` parameter in the CR Composite Text node affects the visual appearance of the text element within the composition by specifying the font style to be used for the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `line_spacing` parameter in the CR Composite Text node?",
        "answer": "The `line_spacing` parameter is used to adjust the spacing between lines of text, allowing for better readability and aesthetic arrangement of the text content within the image."
