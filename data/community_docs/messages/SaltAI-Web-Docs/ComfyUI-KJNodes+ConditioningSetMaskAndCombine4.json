        "question": "What is the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a series of masks to conditioning data, combining them based on specified strengths and areas, allowing for the dynamic adjustment of conditioning areas through masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive_i' input represent in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_i' input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node specifies the positive conditioning data to be combined with the corresponding mask, allowing for nuanced conditioning effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the area of conditioning affected by the 'set_cond_area' input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'set_cond_area' input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node determines whether the conditioning area is set to the bounds defined by the masks or uses a default setting, affecting how conditioning is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'mask_i' input receive in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_i' input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node receives data of type MASK, which is represented as a torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node bundles multiple conditioning mask and combine nodes into one in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node bundles multiple conditioning mask and combine nodes into one in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node in ComfyUI are 'combined_positive' of type CONDITIONING and 'combined_negative' also of type CONDITIONING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'combined_positive' output in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'combined_positive' output in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4 node is List[torch.Tensor]."
