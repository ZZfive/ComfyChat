        "question": "What is the CR Upscale Image node designed for?",
        "answer": "The CR Upscale Image node in ComfyUI is designed to upscale images using a specified model, with options for adjusting the scale, resizing, and resampling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters are required by the CR Upscale Image node?",
        "answer": "The CR Upscale Image node requires the 'image', 'upscale_model', 'mode', 'rescale_factor', 'resize_width', 'resampling_method', 'supersample', and 'rounding_modulus' parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'upscale_model' parameter influence the image upscaling?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_model' parameter specifies the model to be used for upscaling the image, which impacts the quality and characteristics of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the effects of the 'rescale_factor' parameter in the CR Upscale Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'rescale_factor' parameter determines the factor by which the image is upscaled, directly influencing the increase in image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'supersample' parameter in the CR Upscale Image node?",
        "answer": "When enabled, the 'supersample' parameter applies supersampling for improved image quality, particularly in reducing aliasing effects during the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which ComfyUI node can be used for upscaling images with various options for scale, resizing, and resampling?",
        "answer": "The CR Upscale Image node can be used for upscaling images with a variety of options, including scale adjustment, resizing methods, and resampling choices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rounding_modulus' parameter in CR Upscale Image control?",
        "answer": "The 'rounding_modulus' parameter in CR Upscale Image affects the final dimensions of the upscaled image by rounding them to the nearest multiple of this value."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what purpose is the CR Upscale Image node typically used in the Comfyroll Studio category?",
        "answer": "In the Comfyroll Studio category, the CR Upscale Image node is typically used for increasing the resolution of images using advanced upscaling models, with additional controls for image processing."
