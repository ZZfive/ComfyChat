        "question": "Which category does the HintImageEnchance node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HintImageEnchance node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the HintImageEnchance node include 'hint_image' (a collection of images to enhance), 'image_gen_width' (target width for the generated images), 'image_gen_height' (target height for the generated images), and 'resize_mode' (mode of resizing to be applied to the hint images)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'hint_image' represent in the HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "The 'hint_image' parameter represents the collection of hint images that are to be enhanced and resized, which guide the image generation process, influencing the output's appearance."
    },
    {

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'resize_mode' in the HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "'resize_mode' in the HintImageEnchance node specifies the mode of resizing to be applied to the hint images, such as fitting within or stretching to the target dimensions (image_gen_width and image_gen_height)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used together with the HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes together with the HintImageEnchance node include 'VHS_VideoCombine', 'GroundingDinoSAMSegment (segment anything)', and 'Paste By Mask'."
