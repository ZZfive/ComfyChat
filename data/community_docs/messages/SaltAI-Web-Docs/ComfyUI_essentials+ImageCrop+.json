        "question": "What is the ImageCrop+ node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop+ node in ComfyUI is designed for cropping images to specified dimensions and coordinates, allowing for precise control over the portion of the image to be retained or discarded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input fields for the ImageCrop+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input fields for the ImageCrop+ node include the image to be cropped, the width and height of the cropped image area, and additional fields such as position, x_offset, and y_offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageCrop+ handle the primary image input?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop+ node takes the image to be cropped as the primary input for the cropping operation. The dtype for this input is IMAGE in ComfyUI and torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the width input specify in the ImageCrop+ node?",
        "answer": "The width input in the ImageCrop+ node specifies the width of the cropped image area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the height input in the ImageCrop+ node?",
        "answer": "The height input in the ImageCrop+ node specifies the height of the cropped image area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ImageCrop+ node provide for the cropped portion of the image?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop+ node outputs the cropped portion of the input image with a dtype of IMAGE in ComfyUI and torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the x_offset input adjust in the ImageCrop+ node?",
        "answer": "The x_offset input in the ImageCrop+ node adjusts the horizontal position of the top-left corner of the resulting cropped area, reflecting any adjustments made during the cropping process."
