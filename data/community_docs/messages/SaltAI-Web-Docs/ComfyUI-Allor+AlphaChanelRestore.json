        "question": "What is the output node of AlphaChanelRestore?",
        "answer": "The output node of AlphaChanelRestore is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does AlphaChanelRestore handle images lacking an alpha channel?",
        "answer": "AlphaChanelRestore handles images lacking an alpha channel by adding an alpha channel to ensure all images in the batch have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for AlphaChanelRestore?",
        "answer": "The required input type for AlphaChanelRestore is `images`, which is of Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of AlphaChanelRestore?",
        "answer": "The output type of AlphaChanelRestore is a batch of images with an alpha channel added where necessary, maintaining Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `node` method in AlphaChanelRestore?",
        "answer": "The `node` method in AlphaChanelRestore processes images by ensuring each image has an alpha channel, thereby maintaining uniformity in image channel configuration."
    },
