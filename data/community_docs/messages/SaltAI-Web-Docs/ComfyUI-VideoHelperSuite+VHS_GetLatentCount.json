        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_GetLatentCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetLatentCount node in ComfyUI is designed to count the number of latent representations present in a given input, providing a way to quantify the size of latent batches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the VHS_GetLatentCount node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetLatentCount node belongs to the 'Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ï¼¶ï¼¨ï¼³/latent' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents' input represent in the VHS_GetLatentCount node?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' input in the VHS_GetLatentCount node represents the latent representations to be counted, which is crucial for determining the total number of latents in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of data types are associated with the 'latents' input in the VHS_GetLatentCount node?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' input in the VHS_GetLatentCount node is associated with the Comfy dtype 'LATENT' and the Python dtype 'dict'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VHS_GetLatentCount node determine the total number of latent representations?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetLatentCount node determines the total number of latent representations by counting the latent representations in the input batch, as represented by the 'latents' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VHS_GetLatentCount node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the VHS_GetLatentCount node in ComfyUI is the total number of latent representations in the input batch, represented by the 'count' output with the Comfy dtype 'INT' and Python type 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the VHS_GetLatentCount node optimized for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_GetLatentCount node in ComfyUI is optimized for CPU infrastructure."
