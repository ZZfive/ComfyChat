    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node include 'text', 'clip', 'token_normalization', and 'weight_interpretation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' input represent in the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' input represents a CLIP model instance used for text tokenization and embedding generation in the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which custom nodes does the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node interact with in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node interacts with common nodes including KSampler, SamplerCustom, and ControlNetApplyAdvanced in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node is 'conditioning', which is a conditioning format suitable for generative models, including the advanced CLIP text embeddings and optional pooled output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the token_normalization input affect the output of the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' input in the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node specifies the method for normalizing token embeddings, offering options like none, mean, length, and length+mean to adjust the embedding process, thus affecting the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What strategy is defined by the weight_interpretation input in the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The weight_interpretation input in the BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced node defines the strategy for interpreting the weights of token embeddings, with options including comfy, A1111, compel, comfy++, and down_weight."
