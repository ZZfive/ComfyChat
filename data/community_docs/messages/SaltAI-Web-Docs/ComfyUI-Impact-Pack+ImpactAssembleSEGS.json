        "question": "What is the ImpactAssembleSEGS node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactAssembleSEGS node is designed to aggregate segment headers and segment elements into a unified structure, which facilitates the organization and manipulation of segmented data within the ImpactPack framework in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ImpactAssembleSEGS?",
        "answer": "ImpactAssembleSEGS requires 'seg_header' with a Comfy dtype of SEGS_HEADER, represented as a Tuple[str] in Python, and 'seg_elt' with a Comfy dtype of SEG_ELT, also represented as a Tuple[str] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seg_header' represent in ImpactAssembleSEGS?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_header' parameter in ImpactAssembleSEGS represents the header information for a segment, which is essential in assembling the overall segmented structure."
