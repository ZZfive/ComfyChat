        "question": "What is the purpose of the `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node is designed to facilitate the pre-sampling process for image generation tasks, leveraging the SDTurbo scheduler for efficient sampling. It integrates various components to prepare and optimize the sampling pipeline, aiming to enhance the quality and efficiency of generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the number of steps used in the SDTurbo scheduler for the sampling process in `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`?",
        "answer": "The input variable `steps` determines the number of steps to be used in the SDTurbo scheduler for the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `cfg` input influence the `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `cfg` input configures the conditioning factor for the sampling process, influencing the adherence to the input conditions and the overall image quality in the `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `unsharp_kernel_size` input in the `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node?",
        "answer": "The `unsharp_kernel_size` input configures the kernel size for the unsharp mask applied during image enhancement in `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`, affecting the sharpness and clarity of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input setting can be used to control the initial randomness of the images generated by `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`?",
        "answer": "The `s_noise` input specifies the seed noise level for the sampling process, affecting the initial randomness of the images generated by `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node produce?",
        "answer": "The `easy preSamplingSdTurbo` node outputs a modified pipeline configuration after the pre-sampling process, including updated model, sampling settings, and generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code of `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`, what does the `RETURN_NAMES` attribute specify?",
        "answer": "In the source code of `easy preSamplingSdTurbo`, the `RETURN_NAMES` attribute specifies the names of the returned outputs, in this case, it is merely named `pipe`."
