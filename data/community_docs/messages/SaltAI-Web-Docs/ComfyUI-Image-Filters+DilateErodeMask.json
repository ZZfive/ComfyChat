        "question": "What is the DilateErodeMask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DilateErodeMask node in ComfyUI is designed to modify mask images by dilating or eroding them based on the specified radius and shape, adjusting the boundaries of objects within the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DilateErodeMask node alter the boundaries of objects in a mask?",
        "answer": "The DilateErodeMask node alters the boundaries of objects in a mask by either expanding or contracting them, through the process of dilation or erosion, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does a positive radius do in the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "A positive radius in the DilateErodeMask node dilates the mask, expanding the boundaries of the objects within the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the DilateErodeMask node influences the morphological transformation's nature?",
        "answer": "The 'shape' parameter in the DilateErodeMask node influences the morphological transformation's nature by defining the shape of the structuring element used in the dilation or erosion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the modified mask image from the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the modified mask image from the DilateErodeMask node is `MASK`, represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What shapes can the 'shape' parameter take in the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'shape' parameter in the DilateErodeMask node can take two shapes: 'box' or 'circle'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' input parameter specify in the DilateErodeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter in the DilateErodeMask node specifies the mask images to be processed, where the modification through dilation or erosion alters the boundaries of the objects they contain."
