        "question": "What is AnimalPosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "AnimalPosePreprocessor is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for detecting and analyzing animal poses within images, utilizing advanced pose estimation techniques to provide detailed pose information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of AnimalPosePreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of AnimalPosePreprocessor in ComfyUI is 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Faces and Poses Estimators'."
    },
    {
        "question": "image",
        "answer": "The primary input for the AnimalPosePreprocessor node is the input image to be processed for animal pose detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution input affect the output of AnimalPosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The resolution input sets the resolution for the pose detection process in AnimalPosePreprocessor. Higher resolutions can lead to more detailed pose estimations but may require more computational resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models can be used as the pose estimator in AnimalPosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The pose estimator model in AnimalPosePreprocessor can be either 'rtmpose-m_ap10k_256_bs5.torchscript.pt' or 'rtmpose-m_ap10k_256.onnx'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does AnimalPosePreprocessor provide?",
        "answer": "AnimalPosePreprocessor provides three types of outputs: the processed image with detected animal poses highlighted, key points of the detected animal poses, and a user interface component that displays the JSON representation of the poses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type that should be used for AnimalPosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The infra type that should be used for AnimalPosePreprocessor is 'GPU'."
