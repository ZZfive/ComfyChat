        "question": "What is the purpose of the ONNXDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ONNXDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI is designed to utilize an ONNX model for detecting and segmenting objects within images, making it suitable for applications requiring precise object localization and segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with the ONNX Detector (SEGS/legacy) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the ONNX Detector (SEGS/legacy) node in ComfyUI is `ONNXDetectorSEGS`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ONNXDetectorSEGS fall under in the ComfyUI node library?",
        "answer": "ONNXDetectorSEGS falls under the category `ImpactPack/Detector` in the ComfyUI node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter is essential for determining the areas in the image to be processed by ONNXDetectorSEGS?",
        "answer": "The bounding box detector model, used for detection and indicated by the parameter `bbox_detector`, is essential for identifying regions of interest in the image for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `threshold` parameter play in ONNXDetectorSEGS?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` parameter in ONNXDetectorSEGS acts as a threshold value for detection confidence, deciding which objects will be considered detected and segmented based on their confidence scores exceeding this threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ONNXDetectorSEGS utilize the `dilation` parameter in its segmentation process?",
        "answer": "ONNXDetectorSEGS uses the `dilation` parameter to specify the dilation factor for the segmented regions, which can be adjusted to expand or contract the segmented areas as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `drop_size` parameter in ONNXDetectorSEGS?",
        "answer": "The `drop_size` parameter in ONNXDetectorSEGS sets the minimum size of objects to be considered in the segmentation, affecting the granularity of the segmentation by defining the size threshold for object inclusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `labels` parameter enable ONNXDetectorSEGS to handle object detection?",
        "answer": "The `labels` parameter in ONNXDetectorSEGS allows filtering detected objects based on specific labels, ensuring that only objects belonging to selected categories are included in the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the ONNXDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the ONNXDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI is `segs`, which represents the segmented regions of the image that result from the detection and segmentation process."
