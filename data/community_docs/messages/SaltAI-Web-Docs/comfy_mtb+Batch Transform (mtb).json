        "question": "What is the Batch Transform (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Transform (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used to apply a series of 2D transformations to batches of images, including translation, rotation, and scaling, to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of image transformation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is required for the Batch Transform (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Batch Transform (mtb) node is the 'image', which is the input image tensor to be transformed. The data type in Comfy is 'IMAGE', and in Python is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specifies how borders are handled during image transformations in the Batch Transform (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'border_handling' input specifies the method for handling borders during image transformations in the Batch Transform (mtb) node. It can be set to 'edge', 'constant', 'reflect', or 'symmetric'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'constant_color' input in the Batch Transform (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'constant_color' input in the Batch Transform (mtb) node is 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs can be used to control the transformation of images in the Batch Transform (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs that can be used to control the transformation of images in the Batch Transform (mtb) node include 'x', 'y', 'zoom', 'angle', and 'shear', which represent translation, zoom, rotation, and shear operations on each image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'zoom' input in the Batch Transform (mtb) node do?",
        "answer": "The 'zoom' input in the Batch Transform (mtb) node is an optional list of floats indicating the zoom levels to be applied to each image in the batch. The default value is 1.0, which corresponds to no zoom."
    },
    {
        "question": "What exception does the Batch Transform (mtb) node throw if no transform parameters are provided?",
        "answer": "The Batch Transform (mtb) node will throw a ValueError if no transform parameters are provided, stating that 'At least one transform parameter must be provided'."
