        "question": "What is the class name for the node used to merge two sets of latents in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node used to merge two sets of latents in ComfyUI is `VHS_MergeLatents`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the VHS_MergeLatents node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeLatents node belongs to the category `Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/latent` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `latents_A` input in the VHS_MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The `latents_A` input in the VHS_MergeLatents node serves as the first set of latents to be merged and potentially acts as the template for dimension matching."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for specifying the method used for scaling latents in the VHS_MergeLatents node?",
        "answer": "The `scale_method` input in the VHS_MergeLatents node determines the method used for scaling latents to match dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype for the total number of latents in the merged set when using VHS_MergeLatents?",
        "answer": "The output dtype for the total number of latents in the merged set, referred to as `count`, when using VHS_MergeLatents is `INT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which strategy might be used by VHS_MergeLatents to match the dimensions of latents before merging them?",
        "answer": "VHS_MergeLatents might use the strategy `match_smaller` or `match_larger` to match the dimensions of latents before merging them, depending on their sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `crop` input in the VHS_MergeLatents node specify?",
        "answer": "The `crop` input in the VHS_MergeLatents node specifies the cropping method to be applied after scaling, if necessary, to ensure the dimensions of latents are exactly aligned."
