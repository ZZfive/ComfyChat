        "question": "What is the purpose of the Images Masks MultiPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Images Masks MultiPipe node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the processing and manipulation of images and masks within a pipeline, enabling operations such as generation, revision, and inpainting with the support of a model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'generation_img' input represent in the Images Masks MultiPipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'generation_img' input in the Images Masks MultiPipe node specifies the initial image for generation processes, setting the stage for subsequent image manipulations or enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the Images Masks MultiPipe node is used for defining masks?",
        "answer": "The 'generation_mask' input of the Images Masks MultiPipe node is used to define the mask associated with the generation image, used for guiding or restricting certain operations within the image processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'inpaint_model' input play in the Images Masks MultiPipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_model' input in the Images Masks MultiPipe node incorporates a model to support inpainting tasks, enabling the restoration or completion of images based on the provided masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the 'generation_mask' from the Images Masks MultiPipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'generation_mask' output from the Images Masks MultiPipe node has a Comfy dtype of 'MASK', and its Python dtype is also 'MASK'. It outputs the mask associated with the generated image, reflecting any modifications or enhancements made."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the Images Masks MultiPipe node, what does the output 'ipa2_img' represent?",
        "answer": "The 'ipa2_img' output in the Images Masks MultiPipe node represents the second intermediate processed image, showcasing further processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output of the Images Masks MultiPipe node provides the model used for inpainting tasks?",
        "answer": "The 'inpaint_model' output of the Images Masks MultiPipe node provides the model used for inpainting tasks, facilitating the restoration or completion of images."
