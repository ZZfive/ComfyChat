        "question": "What is ImagePadForOutpaint?",
        "answer": "ImagePadForOutpaint is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for preparing images for the outpainting process by adding padding around them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImagePadForOutpaint node adjust?",
        "answer": "The ImagePadForOutpaint node adjusts the image dimensions by adding padding around the original image to ensure compatibility with outpainting algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for ImagePadForOutpaint?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for ImagePadForOutpaint include 'image', 'left', 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'feathering'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImagePadForOutpaint handle padding?",
        "answer": "ImagePadForOutpaint handles padding by expanding the image dimensions based on specified amounts for left, top, right, and bottom padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'feathering' parameter in ImagePadForOutpaint?",
        "answer": "The 'feathering' parameter in ImagePadForOutpaint controls the smoothness of the transition between the original image and the added padding, enhancing visual integration for outpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImagePadForOutpaint generate the output 'mask'?",
        "answer": "ImagePadForOutpaint generates the output 'mask' to indicate the areas of the original image and the added padding, which helps guide the outpainting algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types used in ImagePadForOutpaint?",
        "answer": "In ImagePadForOutpaint, the Python data types used include 'torch.Tensor' for 'image', 'INT' for padding parameters, and 'float' for 'feathering'."
