        "question": "What does the CR Color Gradient node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The CR Color Gradient node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a color gradient between two specified colors over a given canvas, allowing for customization of the gradient's orientation, transition style, and distance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'width' input in the CR Color Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in the CR Color Gradient node specifies the width of the canvas on which the gradient will be applied, impacting the horizontal dimension of the gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Color Gradient node determine the starting color of the gradient?",
        "answer": "The start color of the gradient in the CR Color Gradient node is determined by the 'start_color' input, which can be a predefined color name or 'custom' to use a specific hex color code provided by the 'start_color_hex' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'gradient_distance' input in the CR Color Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_distance' input in the CR Color Gradient node specifies the distance over which the gradient transition occurs, with a value between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of the canvas covered by the gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the direction of the color transition in the CR Color Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The orientation of the gradient (horizontal or vertical) in the CR Color Gradient node is determined by the 'orientation' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the image generated by the CR Color Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The output format of the image generated by the CR Color Gradient node is a numpy.ndarray, represented as 'IMAGE' in ComfyUI's node system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can be used to specify the hex color code for the ending color in the CR Color Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'end_color_hex' input is an optional input in the CR Color Gradient node that allows users to specify the exact hex color code for the ending color of the gradient."
