        "question": "What is AMT VFI?",
        "answer": "AMT VFI is a node in ComfyUI specialized in video frame interpolation using deep learning techniques to generate intermediate frames, enhancing video smoothness and frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the AMT VFI node do?",
        "answer": "The AMT VFI node inserts intermediate frames between existing video frames to improve the video playback quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AMT VFI node enhance video playback?",
        "answer": "The AMT VFI node employs advanced models to predict and insert frames between existing ones, which enhances video smoothness and increases the frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the AMT VFI node?",
        "answer": "The AMT VFI node requires inputs such as 'ckpt_name' for specifying the model checkpoint, 'frames' as input video frames, 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' to control memory usage, and 'multiplier' to determine the number of intermediate frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'ckpt_name' influence the AMT VFI node's operation?",
        "answer": "'ckpt_name' specifies the checkpoint name for the model used in frame interpolation, configuring the specific deep learning model utilized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'frames' in the AMT VFI node?",
        "answer": "'frames' are the input video frames processed by the AMT VFI node for generating interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' affect the AMT VFI node?",
        "answer": "'clear_cache_after_n_frames' controls the frequency of cache clearing during interpolation to manage memory effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'multiplier' in the AMT VFI node?",
        "answer": "'multiplier' determines the number of intermediate frames generated between each pair of original frames, influencing the final frame rate of the output video."
