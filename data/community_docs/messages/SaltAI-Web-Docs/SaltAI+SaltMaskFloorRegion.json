        "question": "What is the SaltMaskFloorRegion node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node in ComfyUI is designed to identify and isolate floor regions within given masks, converting the floor area into a tensor that represents the floor region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is required for the SaltMaskFloorRegion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node requires the input of masks for which floor regions need to be identified. These masks are of dtype MASK in Comfy and dtype torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SaltMaskFloorRegion node in ComfyUI produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node outputs a tensor representing the isolated floor regions within the input masks, with dtype MASK in Comfy and dtype torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the SaltMaskFloorRegion class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the SaltMaskFloorRegion class is floor_region, which processes the input masks to extract and return the floor regions as a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltMaskFloorRegion node process each mask?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node processes each mask by converting it into a PIL image, extracting the floor region using the MaskFilters.floor_region function, then converting it back into a tensor using the pil2mask function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required for the SaltMaskFloorRegion node to function in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node requires an infrastructure type of GPU to function in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SaltMaskFloorRegion node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFloorRegion node falls under the category of SALT/Masking/Filter in ComfyUI."
