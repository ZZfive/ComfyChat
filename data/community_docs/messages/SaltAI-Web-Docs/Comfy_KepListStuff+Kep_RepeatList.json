    {
        "question": "What is the `In` input used for in the Kep_RepeatList node?",
        "answer": "The `In` input serves as the base list whose elements will be replicated according to the specified count in the Kep_RepeatList node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the number of repetitions of the input list in the Kep_RepeatList node?",
        "answer": "The `Count` input specifies the number of times the input list should be repeated in the Kep_RepeatList node."

    {
        "question": "What does the `Extended` output in the Kep_RepeatList node represent?",
        "answer": "The `Extended` output in the Kep_RepeatList node represents the output list resulting from repeating the input list elements a specified number of times, effectively extending the original list."

    {
        "question": "How does the Kep_RepeatList node handle the `Count` input when it has multiple values?",
        "answer": "The Kep_RepeatList node does not support multiple values in the `Count` input; if `Count` contains more than one value, a ValueError is raised."
