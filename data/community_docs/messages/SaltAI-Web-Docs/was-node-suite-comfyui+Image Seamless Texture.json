        "question": "What is the 'Image Seamless Texture' node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Seamless Texture' node in ComfyUI is designed to transform an input image into a seamless texture, enabling it to be repeated across larger surfaces without visible seams."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the expected input types for the 'blending' parameter in the 'Image Seamless Texture' node?",
        "answer": "The 'blending' parameter in the 'Image Seamless Texture' node accepts a float value, which determines the degree of blending at the edges of the texture. A higher value results in more seamless edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific class is associated with the 'Image Seamless Texture' functionality in ComfyUI's WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The specific class associated with the 'Image Seamless Texture' functionality in ComfyUI's WAS Suite is `WAS_Image_Make_Seamless`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Image Seamless Texture' node handle the input image to create a seamless texture?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Seamless Texture' node transforms the input image by optionally tiling it across a specified number of tiles and blending the edges to ensure the texture can be repeated without visible seams."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'tiled' parameter in the 'Image Seamless Texture' node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'tiled' parameter in the 'Image Seamless Texture' node is a boolean that determines whether the texture should be tiled. If true, the texture is repeated across the specified number of tiles, enhancing the seamless effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and format of the 'Image Seamless Texture' node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'Image Seamless Texture' node is 'images', which is in the format of torch.Tensor. This represents the resulting seamless texture that can be tiled across surfaces without visible seams."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the 'Image Seamless Texture' node, what is the purpose of the 'tiles' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'tiles' parameter in the 'Image Seamless Texture' node specifies the number of tiles the texture is divided into, both horizontally and vertically. This parameter is essential when tiling is enabled, as it directly affects the texture's repetitiveness and seamless nature."
