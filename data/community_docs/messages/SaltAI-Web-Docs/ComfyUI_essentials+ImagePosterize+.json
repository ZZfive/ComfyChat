        "question": "What is the ImagePosterize+ node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImagePosterize+ node in ComfyUI is used to apply a posterization effect to images, reducing the color depth to a specified threshold, which simplifies the color palette and creates a graphic effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImagePosterize+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImagePosterize+ node are `image` (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and `threshold` (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `threshold` parameter influence the output of the ImagePosterize+ node?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` parameter in the ImagePosterize+ node defines how much the color depth of the image is reduced, controlling the extent of the posterization effect and thus determining the final appearance of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImagePosterize+ node output?",
        "answer": "The ImagePosterize+ node outputs the posterized image after applying the effect, with reduced color depth as defined by the `threshold` input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with the ImagePosterize+ node and what is its category?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the ImagePosterize+ node is `ImagePosterize+` and its category is `essentials`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between `Required` and `Output` types in the context of the ImagePosterize+ node?",
        "answer": "The `Required` types in ImagePosterize+ refer to the inputs needed for the node to function, such as the `image` and `threshold`, whereas the `Output` type (`image`) describes the format and properties of the node's output after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the ImagePosterize+ node be executed on a GPU or CPU?",
        "answer": "The ImagePosterize+ node can be executed on a GPU as its infrastructure type is specified as `GPU`."
