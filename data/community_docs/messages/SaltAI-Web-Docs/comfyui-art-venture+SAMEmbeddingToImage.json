    {
        "question": "What category does the SAMEmbeddingToImage node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAMEmbeddingToImage node falls under the 'Art Venture/Segmentation' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SAMEmbeddingToImage node is the 'embedding', which represents the SAM embedding to be transformed into an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'embedding' input in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'embedding' input in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node expects data of type SAM_EMBEDDING, which is a np.ndarray in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output represent in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node represents an image generated from the SAM embedding, allowing for the visualization and further processing of the encoded information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'image' output in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output in the SAMEmbeddingToImage node is of type IMAGE in ComfyUI and a Tuple[torch.Tensor] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SAMEmbeddingToImage node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for the SAMEmbeddingToImage node is CPU."
