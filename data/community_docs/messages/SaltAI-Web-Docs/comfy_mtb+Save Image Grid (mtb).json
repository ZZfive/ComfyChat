        "question": "What is the Save Image Grid (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Save Image Grid (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used to compile a collection of images into a single, cohesive grid layout, which is particularly useful for visualizing multiple images in a structured format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Save Image Grid (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Save Image Grid (mtb) node include a batch of images (`images`), a filename prefix (`filename_prefix`), and a boolean flag (`save_intermediate`) indicating whether intermediate images should be saved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` input type of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node represent?",
        "answer": "The `images` input type of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node represents a batch of images to be compiled into a grid. It is of Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `List[PIL.Image]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `filename_prefix` input of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The `filename_prefix` input of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node is used as a prefix for the filename under which the grid image will be saved, allowing for customizable naming of the output file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `save_intermediate` input of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node do?",
        "answer": "The `save_intermediate` input of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node is a boolean flag indicating whether intermediate images should be saved during the grid compilation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `create_image_grid` method in the Save Image Grid (mtb) node class?",
        "answer": "The `create_image_grid` method in the Save Image Grid (mtb) node class is used to create a new blank image to hold the grid and then paste the individual images onto the grid based on the calculated grid size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the grid size calculated in the `create_image_grid` method of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The grid size in the `create_image_grid` method of the Save Image Grid (mtb) node is calculated based on the square root of the total number of images, which then determines the number of rows and columns for the grid layout."
