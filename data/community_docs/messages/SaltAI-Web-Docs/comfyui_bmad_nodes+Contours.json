        "question": "What is the purpose of the Contours node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Contours node in ComfyUI is designed to identify and extract contours from an image based on specified retrieval and approximation modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Contours node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Contours node belongs to the category 'Bmad/CV/Contour' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for the Contours node to function?",
        "answer": "The input image, represented as 'IMAGE', is crucial for the Contours node to function as it serves as the basis for contour detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'retrieval_mode' input control in the Contours node?",
        "answer": "The 'retrieval_mode' input in the Contours node controls the contour retrieval mode, which determines how the contours are organized or retrieved, impacting the structure of the output contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used by ComfyUI for the 'image', 'cv_contours', and 'cv_contour' nodes?",
        "answer": "The 'image' node uses the 'IMAGE' data type, 'cv_contours' uses 'CV_CONTOURS', and 'cv_contour' uses 'CV_CONTOUR' in the ComfyUI environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cv_contours_hierarchy' output from the Contours node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'cv_contours_hierarchy' output from the Contours node represents the hierarchical relationship between contours, providing insight into their nesting and organization within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the approximation modes available for the Contours node to extract contours?",
        "answer": "The approximation modes available for the Contours node include 'CHAIN_APPROX_NONE', 'CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE', 'CHAIN_APPROX_TC89_L1', and 'CHAIN_APPROX_TC89_KCOS'."
