        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor node is designed to analyze and process images to detect and adjust their color palette."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which algorithm does Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor use for color detection?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor uses a color detection algorithm to enhance or modify the image's color properties based on the specified resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The required input for Inference_Core_ColorPreprocessor is the `image` input, which represents the input image to be processed for color detection and adjustment."
