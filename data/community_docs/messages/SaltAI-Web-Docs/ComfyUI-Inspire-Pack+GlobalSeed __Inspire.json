        "question": "What is the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "`GlobalSeed __Inspire` is a node in the Inspire pack that manages and manipulates the global seed value across various nodes in a workflow, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and variation in generative process outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node belong to?",
        "answer": "The `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node belongs to the `InspirePack/Prompt` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible actions that can be performed on the seed value in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node?",
        "answer": "The possible actions that can be performed on the seed value in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node include `fixed`, `increment`, `decrement`, `randomize`, `increment for each node`, `decrement for each node`, and `randomize for each node`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the `mode` input of the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node influence the workflow?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input of the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node determines whether the seed manipulation occurs before or after the generation process, affecting how and when the seed value influences the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `value` input in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node?",
        "answer": "The `value` input in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node has a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`, specifying the initial seed value for the manipulation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `last_seed` input in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node?",
        "answer": "The `last_seed` input in the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node holds the last seed value used, enabling tracking and potentially reverting to a previous state."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are best used in conjunction with the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node?",
        "answer": "Common nodes best used in conjunction with the `GlobalSeed __Inspire` node are not specified, but nodes that utilize or are affected by the global seed value would be suitable partners."
