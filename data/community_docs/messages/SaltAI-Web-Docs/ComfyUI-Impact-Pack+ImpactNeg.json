        "question": "What is the ImpactNeg node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNeg node in ComfyUI is designed to invert the truth value of a given boolean input, serving as a logical NOT operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImpactNeg node belong?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNeg node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Logic' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactNeg node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactNeg node is a boolean value which is the negation of the input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'value' input in the ImpactNeg node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input in the ImpactNeg node represents the boolean input to be negated, facilitating the execution of conditional logic based on the negated result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'value' input and the output of the ImpactNeg node?",
        "answer": "The data type of both the 'value' input and the output of the ImpactNeg node is BOOLEAN, both in Comfy dtype and Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactNeg node enable in a node network?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNeg node enables conditional logic flows within a node network by inverting boolean inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the ImpactNeg node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNeg node requires a 'CPU' infrastructure type for its operation."
