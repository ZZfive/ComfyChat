    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IterativeImageUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IterativeImageUpscale node include 'pixels' in 'IMAGE' format, 'upscale_factor' as 'FLOAT', 'steps' as 'INT', 'temp_prefix' as 'STRING', 'upscaler' as 'UPSCALER', 'vae' as 'VAE', and 'step_mode' as a 'COMBO[STRING]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pixels' parameter represent in IterativeImageUpscale?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' parameter in IterativeImageUpscale represents the input image data in pixel format, serving as the foundation for the upscaling process in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the number of iterations in the upscaling process for the IterativeImageUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter controls the number of iterations or steps the upscaling process will undergo in IterativeImageUpscale. This affects the gradual improvement in image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IterativeImageUpscale generate a higher-resolution image?",
        "answer": "IterativeImageUpscale generates a higher-resolution image through iterative upscaling techniques, resulting in an output image that is a higher-resolution version of the input image, suitable for detailed and high-resolution applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the operational mode for each upscaling step in IterativeImageUpscale?",
        "answer": "The 'step_mode' parameter in IterativeImageUpscale defines the mode of operation for each upscaling step, such as 'simple' or other advanced methods, which affects the approach to image enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does 'upscaler' play in the IterativeImageUpscale process?",
        "answer": "The 'upscaler' parameter in IterativeImageUpscale indicates the upscaling model or technique to be used, which is crucial for the method of resolution enhancement that takes place."
