        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node is designed for advanced cropping operations on batches of images based on their associated masks. It calculates the optimal bounding box for each mask, applies smoothing to the bounding box sizes, and adjusts the crop size dynamically to ensure consistency and precision across the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required by the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs are `original_images`, `masks`, `crop_size_mult`, and `bbox_smooth_alpha`. The `original_images` and `masks` are lists of original images and associated masks, respectively, while `crop_size_mult` and `bbox_smooth_alpha` are parameters for adjusting the crop size and smoothing bounding box sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node return?",
        "answer": "The node returns several outputs including `original_images`, `cropped_images`, `cropped_masks`, `combined_crop_image`, `combined_crop_masks`, `bboxes`, `combined_bounding_box`, `bbox_width`, and `bbox_height` to detail the results of the cropping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the bounding boxes for cropping calculated by BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced?",
        "answer": "BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced calculates the bounding boxes by identifying the areas of interest within each mask. It determines non-zero regions that signify relevant content for cropping the corresponding images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `combined_crop_image` output from BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced represent?",
        "answer": "The `combined_crop_image` output is a single image created by combining the cropped areas from the original images, based on the combined bounding box calculated from all masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node classified under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node is classified under the 'KJNodes/masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `crop_size_mult` parameter in the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_size_mult` parameter adjusts the size of the crop dynamically, allowing for flexibility in the final crop dimensions when used with the BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced node."
