        "question": "What is the category of the TSC_Noise_Control_Script node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TSC_Noise_Control_Script node falls under the category of 'Efficiency Nodes/Scripts' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with the TSC_Noise_Control_Script in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TSC_Noise_Control_Script is commonly used with nodes such as KSampler Adv. (Efficient) and KSampler SDXL (Eff.)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rng_source' input parameter in TSC_Noise_Control_Script node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'rng_source' parameter specifies the source of randomness for noise generation, allowing selection from CPU, GPU, or NV options."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'cfg_denoiser' input affect the output of TSC_Noise_Control_Script in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg_denoiser' input is a boolean flag that enables or disables the configuration denoiser, affecting the noise filtering process during generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'add_seed_noise' parameter in TSC_Noise_Control_Script?",
        "answer": "The 'add_seed_noise' parameter determines whether additional noise based on a seed value should be introduced, adding another layer of variability to the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "In TSC_Noise_Control_Script, what does the 'weight' parameter control?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter defines the intensity of the noise effect on the output by adjusting the weight of the seed noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the TSC_Noise_Control_Script node calculated?",
        "answer": "The output of the TSC_Noise_Control_Script node is a modified or extended script with noise settings applied, facilitating customized noise control within the generation process."
