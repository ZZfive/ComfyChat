        "question": "What is the purpose of the LatentBatchSplitter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchSplitter node is designed to split a batch of latent representations into smaller batches or individual samples based on a specified count, which is useful for managing and manipulating batches of data where operations need to be performed on smaller subsets or items within a larger batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'latent' input parameter for in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' input parameter represents the batch of latent representations to be split, which is crucial for determining the structure and content of the output batches."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'split_count' input parameter influence the operation of the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The 'split_count' parameter specifies the number of splits or individual samples to extract from the input batch, affecting the granularity of the splitting operation and allowing for flexible adjustments of batch sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the input 'latent' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the input 'latent' parameter in the LatentBatchSplitter node is a dictionary of strings to PyTorch tensors, represented as `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the LatentBatchSplitter node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentBatchSplitter node is a tuple of smaller batches or individual latent representations derived from the original input batch according to the specified split count."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can split a large batch into smaller batches?",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchSplitter node, found in the InspirePack/Util category of ComfyUI, is capable of splitting a large batch of latent representations into smaller batches or individual samples based on a specified count."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what type of processor does the LatentBatchSplitter node operate'",
        "answer": "The LatentBatchSplitter node operates on a CPU."
