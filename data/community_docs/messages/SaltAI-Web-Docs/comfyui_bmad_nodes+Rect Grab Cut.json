        "question": "What is the purpose of the Rect Grab Cut node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Rect Grab Cut node in ComfyUI is designed for image segmentation using the GrabCut algorithm with a predefined rectangular area, aiming to separate the foreground from the background within the specified rectangle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input in the Rect Grab Cut node represent?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in the Rect Grab Cut node represents the input image to be segmented. This image is processed to separate the foreground from the background within a specified rectangular area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `output_format` parameter in the Rect Grab Cut node determine?",
        "answer": "The `output_format` parameter in the Rect Grab Cut node determines the format in which the segmented image should be outputted, affecting how the image is processed and displayed post-segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used for image segmentation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the Rect Grab Cut node can be used for image segmentation purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the segmented image outputted by the Rect Grab Cut node?",
        "answer": "The segmented image outputted by the Rect Grab Cut node is processed to have the foreground separated from the background within the specified rectangular area and is of type `IMAGE` (torch.Tensor in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input does the Rect Grab Cut node require?",
        "answer": "The Rect Grab Cut node requires the input image to be segmented (`image`), coordinates of the top left (`x1`, `y1`) and bottom right (`x2`, `y2`) corners of the rectangle, the number of iterations (`iterations`), and the output format (`output_format`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is processed and enhanced by the Rect Grab Cut node in an image?",
        "answer": "The Rect Grab Cut node processes an image to separate the foreground from the background within a specified rectangular area, enhancing the focus on the desired object or area in the image."
