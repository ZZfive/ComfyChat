        "question": "What is CM_Vec3UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryOperation is a custom node in ComfyUI that performs unary operations on 3-dimensional vectors, transforming a single vector based on a specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec3UnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec3' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_Vec3UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec3UnaryOperation specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector, influencing the transformation outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' input represent in CM_Vec3UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in CM_Vec3UnaryOperation represents the 3-dimensional vector to be transformed, serving as the base vector for the unary operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does CM_Vec3UnaryOperation produce?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryOperation produces a 'VEC3' output, which is the result of applying the specified unary operation to the input vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec3UnaryOperation simplify vector manipulation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryOperation simplifies vector manipulation by abstracting the complexity of unary operations on 3-dimensional vectors, making vector transformations more efficient and straightforward."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of 'op' in ComfyUI for CM_Vec3UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the dtype of 'op' for CM_Vec3UnaryOperation is 'COMBO[STRING]', representing a choice of unary operations as a string."
