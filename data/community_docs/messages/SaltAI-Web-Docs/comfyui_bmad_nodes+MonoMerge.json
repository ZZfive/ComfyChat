        "question": "What is the class name of the node used for merging two images into a monochromatic image based on a target color scheme in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node used for merging two images into a monochromatic image based on a target color scheme in ComfyUI is `MonoMerge`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'image1' input play in the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI, 'image1' input is the first image to be merged, playing a crucial role by comparing its pixels with the second image to determine the final monochromatic image based on the target color scheme."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines if the merge should emphasize lighter or darker aspects of the images in the MonoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The 'target' input in the MonoMerge node determines whether the merge should emphasize lighter or darker aspects of the images, with the options being 'white' or 'black'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What format is the monochromatic image output from the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The monochromatic image output from the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI is in the `IMAGE` format, which can be a `torch.Tensor` in Python, allowing for flexibility in how the result is utilized or displayed based on the 'output_format' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the MonoMerge node found in ComfyUI, and what is its function?",
        "answer": "The MonoMerge node is found in the 'Bmad/image' category in ComfyUI, designed to merge two images into a monochromatic image by selecting pixels based on a target color scheme, either towards white or black."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI allows for the merging of images to either emphasize lighter or darker aspects, and what is its source code class name?",
        "answer": "The node that allows for the merging of images in ComfyUI to either emphasize lighter or darker aspects is called `MonoMerge`, which is the source code class name for this functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the infrastructure type needed for running the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type needed for running the MonoMerge node in ComfyUI is determined to be 'GPU', as specified in the usage tips."
