        "question": "What is ImageFromBatch?",
        "answer": "ImageFromBatch is a class in ComfyUI designed to extract a specific segment of images from a larger batch based on a given index and length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageFromBatch do?",
        "answer": "ImageFromBatch allows for the extraction of a subset of images from a batch, specified by a starting index and length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageFromBatch include 'image', 'batch_index', and 'length'. 'image' represents the batch of images, 'batch_index' specifies the starting index within the batch, and 'length' determines the number of images to extract."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageFromBatch handle the 'image' parameter?",
        "answer": "ImageFromBatch handles the 'image' parameter as a batch of images from which a subset will be extracted. It is crucial for specifying the source batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ImageFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageFromBatch is an 'IMAGE' Comfy dtype, which is a subset of images extracted from the original batch based on the specified 'batch_index' and 'length'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'batch_index' parameter in ImageFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'batch_index' parameter in ImageFromBatch is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageFromBatch ensure precise selection of images?",
        "answer": "ImageFromBatch ensures precise selection of images by using the 'batch_index' parameter to specify the starting index within the batch and the 'length' parameter to determine how many images are extracted."
