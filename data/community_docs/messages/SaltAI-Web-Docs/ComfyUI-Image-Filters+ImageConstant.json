        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageConstant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageConstant node is designed to generate images of a constant color, allowing for the specification of the color in RGB format along with the image dimensions and batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which categories does the ImageConstant node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageConstant node is categorized under 'image/filters' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageConstant node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageConstant node include 'width', 'height', 'batch_size', 'red', 'green', 'blue', specifying the dimensions, number of images, and color in RGB format respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what format are the output images from the ImageConstant node returned?",
        "answer": "The output from the ImageConstant node is an image or a batch of images with the specified constant color in RGB format, returned as a 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' input in the ImageConstant node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in the ImageConstant node specifies the width of the generated images, affecting the horizontal dimension of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the ImageConstant node be used to generate multiple images in one batch?",
        "answer": "The ImageConstant node can be used to generate multiple images in one batch by setting the 'batch_size' input to the desired number of images to be created at once."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' inputs in the ImageConstant node?",
        "answer": "The 'red', 'green', and 'blue' inputs in the ImageConstant node set the respective color components of the constant color for the generated images."
