        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageReceiver node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageReceiver node in ComfyUI is designed to process and transform image data received in various formats, including base64-encoded strings, to ensure images are in a consistent and usable state for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageReceiver node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageReceiver node include 'image', 'link_id', 'save_to_workflow', 'image_data', and 'trigger_always'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What functions does the 'save_to_workflow' parameter in ImageReceiver node control?",
        "answer": "The 'save_to_workflow' parameter in ImageReceiver node controls whether the processed image should be saved to the workflow, triggering the image processing and transformation steps when enabled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the ImageReceiver node provide?",
        "answer": "The ImageReceiver node provides the processed image as 'IMAGE' and an optional mask as 'MASK', standardized for further use."

    {
        "question": "Which nodes does ImageReceiver work in conjunction with in ComfyUI for further image processing?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes that ImageReceiver works with, but it can be integrated into any ComfyUI workflow for tasks requiring image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'link_id' parameter in ImageReceiver node help with?",
        "answer": "The 'link_id' parameter in ImageReceiver node is used to identify the specific processing task or workflow instance, aiding in tracking and managing the processed images within a larger system or application."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageReceiver node handle images with transparency data?",
        "answer": "The ImageReceiver node can generate an optional mask based on the image's transparency data for selective processing or analysis."
