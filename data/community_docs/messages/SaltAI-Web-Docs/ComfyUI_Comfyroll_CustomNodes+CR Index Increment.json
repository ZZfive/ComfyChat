        "question": "What is the CR Index Increment node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Index Increment node in ComfyUI is designed to modify an index value by incrementing it with a specified interval, providing a simple yet effective way to iterate through sequences or collections."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of parameters does the 'index' in CR Index Increment node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter in the CR Index Increment node represents the current position in a sequence or collection, and it is the base value that will be incremented to move to the next position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'interval' parameter in the CR Index Increment node?",
        "answer": "The 'interval' parameter in the CR Index Increment node specifies the amount by which the 'index' should be incremented to allow for flexible stepping through a sequence or collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CR Index Increment node return?",
        "answer": "The CR Index Increment node returns the updated 'index' after being incremented by the specified interval, the unchanged 'interval' parameter, and a 'show_help' URL providing additional help and information about the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the 'index' input and output on the CR Index Increment node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the 'index' input and output on the CR Index Increment node is 'INT'."

    {
        "question": "How is the 'interval' parameter used by the CR Index Increment node?",
        "answer": "The 'interval' parameter is used by the CR Index Increment node to specify the amount by which the 'index' should be incremented."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find more information about the CR Index Increment node?",
        "answer": "You can find more information about the CR Index Increment node by following the help URL provided by the 'show_help' output parameter, which links to the node's documentation."
