        "question": "What is ttN pipeLoader in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "ttN pipeLoader in ComfyUI is designed to initialize and manage the loading process for various data pipelines within the tinyterraNodes framework, ensuring seamless integration and efficient handling of data across different stages of the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'ckpt_name' in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "'ckpt_name' is a required input type in the ttN pipeLoader node used to specify the checkpoint name for the model to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which ComfyUI node is used for initializing and managing pipelines?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipeLoader node is used in ComfyUI for initializing and managing pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'positive' input affect the ttN pipeLoader pipeline?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input in ttN pipeLoader defines the positive conditioning for the pipeline, influencing the direction and nature of the data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'negative' input in ttN pipeLoader represent?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' input in ttN pipeLoader sets the negative conditioning input, which provides a counterbalance to the positive conditioning and further refines the pipeline's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ttN pipeLoader node include `pipe` (configured pipeline), `model`, `positive` (positive conditioning), `negative` (negative conditioning), `latent`, `vae`, `clip`, and `seed` for the pipeline's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the function of the 'empty_latent_width' and 'empty_latent_height' parameters in the ttN pipeLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'empty_latent_width' and 'empty_latent_height' parameters in the ttN pipeLoader node define the width and height of the empty latent space representation used in the pipeline."
