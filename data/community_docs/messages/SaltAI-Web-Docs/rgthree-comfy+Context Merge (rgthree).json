        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Merge (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Context Merge (rgthree) node in ComfyUI is to integrate multiple context inputs into a single, unified context output, enabling dynamic context management and updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs can the Context Merge (rgthree) node accept?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node can accept optional inputs of type `RGTHREE_CONTEXT`, which are various context types used throughout ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Context Merge (rgthree) node include `CONTEXT` (RGTHREE_CONTEXT), which is the unified context output, and additional outputs like `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, `LATENT`, `IMAGE`, and `SEED`, all representing different aspects of the merged context."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Merge (rgthree) node handle potential conflicts between different input contexts?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node handles potential conflicts between different input contexts by allowing later contexts to override the values of earlier ones, thereby ensuring the latest input context takes precedence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the inferred Python data type for `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, and other outputs from the Context Merge (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The inferred Python data type for `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, and other outputs from the Context Merge (rgthree) node is `dict`, which allows for a structured and accessible representation of the context components."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what computational environment is the Context Merge (rgthree) node typically set to execute?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge (rgthree) node is typically set to execute in a CPU environment, as indicated by its infrastructure type declaration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `merge` function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node do?",
        "answer": "The `merge` function in the Context Merge (rgthree) node merges any non-null passed contexts, with later contexts potentially overriding earlier ones, and returns the merged context as a tuple with additional context components."
