        "question": "What is the purpose of the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BitwiseAndMaskForEach node is designed to perform a bitwise AND operation on each mask within a collection, effectively combining multiple masks into a single mask that represents the intersection of all input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BitwiseAndMaskForEach node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Operation' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The BitwiseAndMaskForEach node requires two input types: 'base_segs' and 'mask_segs', both of which are 'SEGS' type data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node handle the intersection of input masks?",
        "answer": "The BitwiseAndMaskForEach node computes the intersection of input masks by performing a bitwise AND operation. It identifies overlapping areas between masks, producing a single mask that highlights these intersections."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BitwiseAndMaskForEach node is 'SEGS', representing the resulting mask after performing the bitwise AND operation on the input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which masks contribute to the final output in the BitwiseAndMaskForEach operation?",
        "answer": "The 'base_segs' and 'mask_segs' input masks contribute to the final output in the BitwiseAndMaskForEach operation by intersecting with each other, influencing the node's execution and the characteristics of the resulting mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the resulting data type of 'mask_segs' in the context of BitwiseAndMaskForEach?",
        "answer": "The resulting data type of 'mask_segs' in the context of BitwiseAndMaskForEach is 'torch.Tensor', which is compatible with the Comfy dtype 'SEGS'."
