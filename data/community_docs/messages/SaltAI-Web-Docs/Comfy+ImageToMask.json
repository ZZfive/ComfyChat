        "question": "What is ImageToMask in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImageToMask is a node in ComfyUI designed to convert an image into a mask based on a specified color channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageToMask node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node converts an image into a mask, extracting mask layers corresponding to the red, green, blue, or alpha channels of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node requires inputs of type 'image' and 'channel'. The 'image' parameter is of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor. The 'channel' parameter specifies which color channel (red, green, blue, or alpha) to use."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageToMask node handle the 'image' input?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter in the ImageToMask node is crucial as it determines the content and characteristics of the resulting mask. It represents the input image from which the mask will be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageToMask node?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node outputs a mask of Comfy dtype MASK, which is a binary or grayscale representation of the specified color channel from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with ImageToMask in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes used with ImageToMask in ComfyUI include MaskComposite, GrowMask, and IPAdapterApplyFaceID."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageToMask node facilitate masking operations?",
        "answer": "The ImageToMask node facilitates masking operations by converting specific color channels (red, green, blue, or alpha) of an input image into corresponding mask layers, which can be further used for image processing or masking tasks."
