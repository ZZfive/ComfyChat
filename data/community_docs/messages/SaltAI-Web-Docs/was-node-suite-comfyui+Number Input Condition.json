    {
        "question": "What types of data does the 'number_a' input in the Number Input Condition node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'number_a' input in the Number Input Condition node expects data of type NUMBER, which is compatible with Python's int or float types."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Number Input Condition node determine if an input number is an odd number?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Number Input Condition node can determine if an input number is odd by using the 'if A odd' option for the 'comparison' input."

    {
        "question": "What output does the Number Input Condition node provide when 'return_boolean' is set to 'true'?",
        "answer": "When 'return_boolean' is set to 'true', the Number Input Condition node returns a boolean result of the comparison between 'number_a' and 'number_b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Number Input Condition node handle the 'greater-than or equals' comparison?",
        "answer": "The Number Input Condition node handles the 'greater-than or equals' comparison by returning 1 if 'number_a' is greater than or equal to 'number_b', otherwise it returns 0 when 'return_boolean' is 'true'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output data types provided by the Number Input Condition node?",
        "answer": "The Number Input Condition node provides output data types of NUMBER, FLOAT, and INT, which correspond to Python's int, float, and bool types respectively."
