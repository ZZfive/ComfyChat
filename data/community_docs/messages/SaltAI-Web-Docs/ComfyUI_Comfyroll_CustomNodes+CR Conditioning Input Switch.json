        "question": "What is the CR Conditioning Input Switch node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Conditioning Input Switch is a node in ComfyUI that facilitates conditional logic in data flow, allowing dynamic selection between two conditioning inputs based on a specified integer input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines which conditioning input is passed through by the CR Conditioning Input Switch?",
        "answer": "The conditioning input passed through by the CR Conditioning Input Switch is determined by the integer input `Input`. An input of 1 selects the first conditioning option, and an input of 2 selects the second."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types of the CR Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The CR Conditioning Input Switch node has one required input `Input` of dtype `INT` in Comfy, and two optional inputs `conditioning1` and `conditioning2` of dtype `CONDITIONING` in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The CR Conditioning Input Switch node outputs a conditioning input `CONDITIONING` of dtype `CONDITIONING` in Comfy, and a help URL `show_help` of dtype `STRING` in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `show_help` output of the CR Conditioning Input Switch node provide?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output of the CR Conditioning Input Switch node provides a URL to the help documentation for this node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python dtypes of the input `Input` and the outputs `CONDITIONING` and `show_help`?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the input `Input` is `int`, and the Python dtypes of the outputs `CONDITIONING` and `show_help` are `CONDITIONING` and `str`, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `switch` method in the CR Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The `switch` method in the CR Conditioning Input Switch node is used to switch between the two conditioning inputs based on the integer input `Input`."
