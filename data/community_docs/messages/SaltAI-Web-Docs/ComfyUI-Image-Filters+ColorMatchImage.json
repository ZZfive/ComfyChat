        "question": "What is the ColorMatchImage node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ColorMatchImage node in ComfyUI is used to adjust the colors of an image to match or harmonize with a target color scheme or another image, ensuring color consistency across different elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ColorMatchImage node are 'images', which refers to the source images that need color adjustment; 'reference', specifying the target image or color scheme for matching; 'blur', controlling the level of blur applied to the reference image; and 'factor', determining the intensity of the color matching effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'blur' input in the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' input in the ColorMatchImage node controls the level of blur applied to the reference image, affecting the softness of the color matching effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'factor' input influence the output of the ColorMatchImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the ColorMatchImage node determines the intensity of the color matching effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the final appearance of the image color adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ColorMatchImage node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorMatchImage node belongs to the 'image/filters' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ColorMatchImage node and in what format is it provided?",
        "answer": "The output of the ColorMatchImage node is the 'image', which provides the resulting images after color adjustment. The 'image' output is provided in the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE', which corresponds to the Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can ColorMatchImage handle images with different numbers of frames when matching colors?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ColorMatchImage node can handle images with different numbers of frames by repeating the reference image frame to match the number of frames in the source images, ensuring that color matching is applied uniformly across all frames."
