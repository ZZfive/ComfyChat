        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image fDOF Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image fDOF Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a field of depth effect to images, simulating the depth-of-field effect seen in photography where parts of the image are blurred to emphasize the subject's focus distance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input parameter do in the Image fDOF Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter in the Image fDOF Filter node is crucial for determining the areas of focus and blur within the image by specifying the input image to which the field of depth effect will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the blur effect adjusted in the Image fDOF Filter node?",
        "answer": "The blur effect in the Image fDOF Filter node is adjusted using the 'radius' input parameter, which controls the extent of the area that appears out of focus, and the 'samples' input parameter, which defines the number of samples used in the blur effect, influencing the quality and intensity of the depth-of-field simulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'depth' parameter influence in the Image fDOF Filter node?",
        "answer": "The 'depth' parameter in the Image fDOF Filter node specifies the depth information for each part of the image, utilized to calculate the blur intensity in relation to the subject's focus distance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of blur can be applied by the Image fDOF Filter node and how are they selected?",
        "answer": "The type of blur in the Image fDOF Filter node can be selected through the 'mode' input parameter, offering options such as 'mock', 'gaussian', and 'box' to simulate different depth-of-field effects based on the blur algorithm used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image fDOF Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image fDOF Filter node is the image with the field of depth effect applied, showcasing areas of focus and blur based on the specified parameters, output as a `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the Image fDOF Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Image fDOF Filter node is recommended to be run on an 'GPU' infrastructure type for optimal performance."
