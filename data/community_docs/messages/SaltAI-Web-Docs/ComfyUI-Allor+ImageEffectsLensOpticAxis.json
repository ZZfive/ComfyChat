        "question": "What is ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis is a class in ComfyUI that applies a lens optic axis effect to images, altering their appearance based on parameters like lens shape, edge behavior, curvature, zoom level, aperture size, and blur intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis belongs to the category image/effects/lens in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis include images (of type IMAGE), lens_shape (a combination of strings like circle, square, rectangle, and corners), lens_edge (a combination of strings like around and symmetric), lens_curvy (a float value), lens_zoom (a float value), lens_aperture (a float value), and blur_intensity (an integer)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis manipulate images?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis manipulates images by creating a mask that selectively applies transformations based on lens parameters such as shape, edge behavior, curvature, zoom level, aperture size, and blur intensity. It simulates the optical axis effect of a lens on the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the lens_curvy parameter do in ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis?",
        "answer": "The lens_curvy parameter in ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis adjusts the curvature of the lens effect, allowing customization of the intensity and shape of the optic axis effect applied to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is blur intensity controlled in ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis?",
        "answer": "Blur intensity in ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis is controlled using the blur_intensity parameter, which sets the intensity of the blur effect applied alongside the lens optic axis effect, contributing to the overall visual simulation of a camera lens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis?",
        "answer": "The output types of ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis include image (of type IMAGE) and mask (of type MASK). These represent the transformed images after applying the lens optic axis effect and the mask used to apply the effect selectively."
