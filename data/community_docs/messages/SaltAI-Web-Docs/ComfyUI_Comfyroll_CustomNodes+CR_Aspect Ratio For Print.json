        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node is designed to adjust the aspect ratio of images specifically for print purposes, ensuring that the output is optimized for standard print sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class name is associated with the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node is CR_AspectRatioForPrint."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the initial width of an image specified in the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node?",
        "answer": "The initial width of the image in the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node is specified by the 'width' parameter, which is of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters allow for scaling adjustments in the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node?",
        "answer": "The CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node includes the 'upscale_factor' and 'prescale_factor' parameters which allow for scaling adjustments. The 'upscale_factor' scales the image's dimensions up and is of Comfy dtype FLOAT and Python dtype 'float'. The 'prescale_factor' scales the image's dimensions before aspect ratio adjustments and is also of Comfy dtype FLOAT and Python dtype 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the node is responsible for swapping width and height dimensions?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_dimensions' parameter, which is of Comfy dtype COMBO[STRING] and Python dtype 'str', is responsible for swapping width and height dimensions in the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of outputs does the CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node generate?",
        "answer": "The CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node generates outputs including 'width', 'height', 'upscale_factor', 'prescale_factor', 'batch_size', 'empty_latent', and 'show_help'. These outputs reflect the processed image dimensions and related scaling factors, as well as a placeholder tensor for the images and a help link."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can additional help and documentation regarding aspect ratio adjustments for print be found according to CR_Aspect Ratio For Print node?",
        "answer": "Additional help and documentation regarding aspect ratio adjustments for print can be found at the link provided in the 'show_help' output, which is \"https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/Aspect-Ratio-Nodes#cr-aspect-ratio-scial-media\"."
