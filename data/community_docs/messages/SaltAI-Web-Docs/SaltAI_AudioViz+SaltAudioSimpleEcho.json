        "question": "What is the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleEcho node in ComfyUI is used to apply an echo effect to an audio input, allowing customization of the number of echoes, the delay between them, and the decay factor for each subsequent echo."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node include `audio` (Comfy dtype: `AUDIO`, Python dtype: `bytes`), `times` (Comfy dtype: `INT`, Python dtype: `int`), `delay_ms` (Comfy dtype: `INT`, Python dtype: `int`), and `decay_factor` (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `audio` input represent in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The `audio` input in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node represents the primary audio input to which the echo effect will be applied, serving as the base for generating echoes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `times` input affect the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node's output?",
        "answer": "The `times` input in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node specifies the number of times the echo effect is applied, influencing the richness and complexity of the resulting audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `delay_ms` input in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The `delay_ms` input in the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node sets the delay in milliseconds between each echo, determining the temporal spacing of the echoes."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node, what role does the `decay_factor` play?",
        "answer": "In the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node, the `decay_factor` input controls the reduction in volume of each subsequent echo, affecting the fade-out effect over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioSimpleEcho node is modified audio with the applied echo effect, showcasing depth and spatial enhancements, and its Comfy dtype is `AUDIO` with Python dtype `bytes`."
