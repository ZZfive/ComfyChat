        "question": "What is the FaceDetailer node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceDetailer node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the details of faces in images, focusing on improving visual quality and clarity of facial features and expressions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the FaceDetailer node is the `image` input, which is the input image to be enhanced, focusing on facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FaceDetailer node determine the size for guiding the enhancement process?",
        "answer": "The FaceDetailer node determines the size for guiding the enhancement process through the `guide_size` input, which specifies the size for guiding the enhancement, influencing the level of detail achievable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the focus area of the enhancement in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The focus area of the enhancement in the FaceDetailer node is determined by `guide_size_for`, which specifies the size for bounding box guidance, affecting the focus area of the enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the cropping factor for bounding boxes in the FaceDetailer node?",
        "answer": "The `bbox_crop_factor` input controls the cropping factor for bounding boxes in the FaceDetailer node, affecting the area of the image focused on for enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes can be used for further processing in conjunction with the output of FaceDetailer?",
        "answer": "Nodes such as PreviewImage, FaceDetailerPipe, MaskToImage, Reroute, SaveImage, PlaySound|pysssss, InvertMask, ImageInvert, ImageCompositeMasked, and ImageBlend can be used for further processing in conjunction with the output of FaceDetailer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of FaceDetailer node is used for setting the dilation amount for bounding boxes?",
        "answer": "The `bbox_dilation` input of the FaceDetailer node is used for setting the dilation amount for bounding boxes, influencing the focus area of enhancement."
