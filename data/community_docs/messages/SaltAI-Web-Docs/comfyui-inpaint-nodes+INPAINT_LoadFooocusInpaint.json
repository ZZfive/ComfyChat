        "question": "What is the purpose of the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node is designed to load specific inpainting models, focusing on initializing and preparing the models for the inpainting process in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models are loaded by the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node and what are their roles?",
        "answer": "The INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node loads the head model specified by the 'head' parameter and the patch model specified by the 'patch' parameter. The head model is crucial for initializing the inpainting head model with the correct weights for the inpainting process, while the patch model is essential for applying localized adjustments or enhancements during the inpainting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint return?",
        "answer": "INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint returns a tuple containing the initialized inpainting head model and the loaded patch model, ready for use in the inpainting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which attribute do you specify the filename of the head model to be loaded in the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node?",
        "answer": "In the 'head' attribute, you specify the filename of the head model to be loaded in the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you access the filename list of models for the 'head' and 'patch' parameters in the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node?",
        "answer": "You access the filename list of models for the 'head' and 'patch' parameters in the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node using folder_paths.get_filename_list('inpaint')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node is optimized for CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which library is used to load the models in the source code of the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node?",
        "answer": "The source code of the INPAINT_LoadFooocusInpaint node uses the torch library to load the models."
