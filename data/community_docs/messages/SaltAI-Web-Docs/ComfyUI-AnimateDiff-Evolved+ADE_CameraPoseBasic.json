        "question": "What is ADE_CameraPoseBasic?",
        "answer": "ADE_CameraPoseBasic is a node in ComfyUI designed to create basic camera control poses for animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_CameraPoseBasic output?",
        "answer": "ADE_CameraPoseBasic outputs generated camera control poses in the form of CAMERACTRL_POSES."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ADE_CameraPoseBasic?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_CameraPoseBasic include motion_type (string), speed (float), and frame_length (integer)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_CameraPoseBasic determine the duration of camera movement?",
        "answer": "ADE_CameraPoseBasic determines the duration of camera movement based on the frame_length input, which specifies the number of frames over which the camera motion is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for ADE_CameraPoseBasic?",
        "answer": "The optional input for ADE_CameraPoseBasic is prev_poses, which provides previous camera poses to be combined with the newly generated ones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of motion does ADE_CameraPoseBasic apply to the camera?",
        "answer": "ADE_CameraPoseBasic applies motion to the camera specified by the motion_type input, influencing the direction and nature of the camera's movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_CameraPoseBasic facilitate seamless transitions between animations?",
        "answer": "ADE_CameraPoseBasic facilitates seamless transitions between animations by combining previous camera poses provided via the prev_poses input with the newly generated poses."
