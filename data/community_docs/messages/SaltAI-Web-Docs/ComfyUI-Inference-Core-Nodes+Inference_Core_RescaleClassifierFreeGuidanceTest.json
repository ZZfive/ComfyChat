        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest is a custom node in ComfyUI that patches a given model to enhance its inference capabilities by rescaling the classifier-free guidance process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RescaleClassifierFreeGuidance node enhance the model's output quality?",
        "answer": "The RescaleClassifierFreeGuidance node adjusts the balance between conditioned and unconditioned generation through a specified multiplier, which improves the output quality of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node are `model` and `multiplier`. The `model` input is the model to be patched, and the `multiplier` input is a scalar value that adjusts the balance between conditioned and unconditioned generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `multiplier` in the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node?",
        "answer": "The `multiplier` in the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node is a scalar value that adjusts the balance between conditioned and unconditioned generation, influencing the final output quality of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` input represent in the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node?",
        "answer": "The `model` input in the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node represents the model to be patched, which will have its classifier-free guidance process rescaled for improved inference performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest node is a patched model with an adjusted classifier-free guidance process for enhanced inference performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `patch` method do in the RescaleClassifierFreeGuidance class?",
        "answer": "The `patch` method in the RescaleClassifierFreeGuidance class modifies the model's sampler configuration function to apply the rescaling of the classifier-free guidance based on the multiplier provided."
