        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR LoRA List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR LoRA List node in ComfyUI is designed to compile and manage lists of LoRA (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) configurations, facilitating the organization and application of multiple LoRA settings in animation projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR LoRA List node support for the management of LoRA configurations?",
        "answer": "The CR LoRA List node supports the dynamic addition of LoRA configurations to an existing list, enabling users to efficiently manage and apply various LoRA effects based on specific animation requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the first LoRA configuration name in the CR LoRA List?",
        "answer": "The input `lora_name1` specifies the first LoRA configuration name to be added to the list, playing a crucial role in defining the initial set of LoRA settings for the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `alias1` input in the CR LoRA List node?",
        "answer": "The `alias1` input provides an alias for the first LoRA configuration, offering a simplified reference to this specific set of LoRA settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `model_strength_1` input affect the LoRA settings?",
        "answer": "The `model_strength_1` input determines the strength of the model's influence for the first LoRA configuration, affecting the overall impact of this LoRA setting on the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `lora_list` optional input in the CR LoRA List node?",
        "answer": "The `lora_list` optional input is an existing list of LoRA configurations to which new settings can be added, enabling the dynamic management and application of multiple LoRA effects in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the datatype for the `LORA_LIST` output in the CR LoRA List node?",
        "answer": "The datatype for the `LORA_LIST` output in the CR LoRA List node is `LORA_LIST`, which is a list compiled of LoRA configurations, including any newly added settings, ready for application in animation projects."
