        "question": "What is the class name for video frame interpolation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for video frame interpolation in ComfyUI is `FLAVR VFI`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FLAVR_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FLAVR_VFI node are `ckpt_name`, `frames`, `clear_cache_after_n_frames`, `multiplier`, and `duplicate_first_last_frames`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI specializes in video frame interpolation?",
        "answer": "The FLAVR_VFI node specializes in video frame interpolation in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `multiplier` input in the FLAVR_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `multiplier` input in the FLAVR_VFI node specifies the interpolation rate, with a strong recommendation for a 2x rate for optimal performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `frames` input in the FLAVR_VFI node represent?",
        "answer": "The `frames` input in the FLAVR_VFI node represents the input video frames to be interpolated by the FLAVR model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the FLAVR_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the FLAVR_VFI node is `image`, which represents the interpolated frames produced by the FLAVR model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of using the FLAVR_VFI node?",
        "answer": "The benefit of using the FLAVR_VFI node is that it enhances video quality by interpolating frames to achieve smoother motion at a 2x rate, ensuring more fluid and visually appealing playback."
