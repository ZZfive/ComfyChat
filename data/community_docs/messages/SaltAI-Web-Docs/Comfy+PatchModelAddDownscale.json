        "question": "What is PatchModelAddDownscale?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale is a node in ComfyUI designed to modify a given model by introducing downscaling and upscaling operations at specified points within the model's architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of PatchModelAddDownscale?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale aims to adjust the internal representations of a model by altering the resolution of feature maps through downscaling and upscaling operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does PatchModelAddDownscale require?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale requires parameters such as 'model' (torch.nn.Module), 'block_number' (int), 'downscale_factor' (float), 'start_percent' (float), 'end_percent' (float), 'downscale_after_skip' (bool), 'downscale_method' (str), and 'upscale_method' (str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PatchModelAddDownscale modify the model?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale modifies the model by applying downscaling and upscaling operations at specified blocks of the model, adjusting the feature map resolution based on parameters such as downscale_factor and methods like downscale_method and upscale_method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by PatchModelAddDownscale?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale requires inputs like 'model' (torch.nn.Module), 'block_number' (int), 'downscale_factor' (float), 'start_percent' (float), 'end_percent' (float), 'downscale_after_skip' (bool), 'downscale_method' (str), and 'upscale_method' (str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of PatchModelAddDownscale?",
        "answer": "The output of PatchModelAddDownscale is a modified model (torch.nn.Module) with downscaling and upscaling operations applied at specified points within its architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PatchModelAddDownscale handle downscaling after skip connections?",
        "answer": "PatchModelAddDownscale handles downscaling after skip connections by optionally applying the downscaling operation after such connections within the model, influencing the flow of information."
    },
