        "question": "What is the SaltParallaxMotion node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltParallaxMotion node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a schedule of parameters for parallax motion effects in audio-visual presentations, dynamically adjusting the motion and depth of elements to create a more immersive experience."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SaltParallaxMotion node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltParallaxMotion node belongs to the category `SALT/Scheduling/Parallax Motion` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output status of the SaltParallaxMotion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltParallaxMotion node is not an output node; its output status is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infra does the SaltParallaxMotion node use?",
        "answer": "The SaltParallaxMotion node uses the infra type `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the front and back `z_min` and `z_max` output parameters represent in SaltParallaxMotion?",
        "answer": "The front and back `z_min` and `z_max` output parameters in SaltParallaxMotion represent the minimum and maximum Z-axis values for the front and back layers' motion range, respectively, contributing to the depth effect in the parallax motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltParallaxMotion node adjust motion ranges based on parallax intensity?",
        "answer": "The SaltParallaxMotion node adjusts the motion ranges based on parallax intensity by calculating the back layer's values, such as `back_x_min`, `back_x_max`, `back_y_min`, and `back_y_max`, by dividing the corresponding front layer values by the parallax intensity. Z values are not adjusted by parallax intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the front layer's zoom adjusted based on zoom_intensity in SaltParallaxMotion?",
        "answer": "The front layer's zoom in SaltParallaxMotion is adjusted based on zoom_intensity by applying a formula that enhances the front zoom relative to the back with higher intensity values, with the adjusted values being `adjusted_front_z_min` and `adjusted_front_z_max`."
