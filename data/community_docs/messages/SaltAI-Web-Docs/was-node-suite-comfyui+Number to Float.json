        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a given number into its floating-point representation, abstracting the process of type conversion and ensuring numerical inputs are seamlessly transformed into floats for operations that require floating-point precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the 'Number to Float' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Float' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Number/Operations' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'number' input used for in the 'Number to Float' node?",
        "answer": "The 'number' input in the 'Number to Float' node is the numerical value that is to be converted into a floating-point representation. This input directly influences the output by determining the exact floating-point value that will be produced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'number' input in the 'Number to Float' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'number' input in the 'Number to Float' node is 'Union[int, float, str]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype for the 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output dtype for the 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI, represented as 'float', corresponds to the floating-point representation of the input number, significant for operations or calculations that require floating-point precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Number to Float' node return in Python dtype?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Float' node returns a value of type 'float' in Python dtype, which represents the floating-point conversion of the input number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type supports the 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Float' node in ComfyUI is supported by the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
