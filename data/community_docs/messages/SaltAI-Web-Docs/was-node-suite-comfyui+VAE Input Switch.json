        "question": "What is the purpose of the VAE Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAE Input Switch node is used to dynamically select between two VAE (Variational Autoencoder) models based on a boolean condition, facilitating conditional logic in workflow operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the selection of VAE models in the VAE Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The selection of VAE models in the VAE Input Switch node is determined by a boolean condition; if true, `vae_a` is selected, and if false, `vae_b` is chosen."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the VAE Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The VAE Input Switch node requires three inputs: `vae_a`, which is the first VAE model option; `vae_b`, the second VAE model option; and `boolean`, the condition determining the model selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model does the VAE Input Switch node output, and what can it be used for subsequently?",
        "answer": "The VAE Input Switch node outputs the selected VAE model based on the boolean condition. This output can then be used in subsequent nodes that require a VAE model for operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used in ComfyUI to enable conditional selection of Variational Autoencoder models?",
        "answer": "The `VAE Input Switch` node can be used in ComfyUI to enable conditional selection of Variational Autoencoder models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name for the VAE Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Python class name for the VAE Input Switch node is `WAS_VAE_Input_Switch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, what is the category that the VAE Input Switch node falls under?",
        "answer": "The VAE Input Switch node falls under the category of `WAS Suite/Logic` in ComfyUI."
