        "question": "What is the function of the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node in ComfyUI serves as a simplified reference implementation within the Inference Core framework, demonstrating basic node structure and inference practices without full node complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple specifies the model to be used for inference?",
        "answer": "The input type `model` specifies the model to be used for inference in the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node. It is stated as a required input with a Comfy dtype of `MODEL`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the reference input influence the inference process in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple?",
        "answer": "The `reference` input in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple provides context for the inference process, contributing to the generation or transformation of the output. It is a required input with a Comfy dtype of `LATENT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the batch_size input determine in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` input in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple determines the number of items to be processed in a single batch, impacting the throughput and performance of the inference. It is a required input of type `INT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python and Comfy dtypes do output 'latent' correspond to in Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple?",
        "answer": "In the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node, the output 'latent' corresponds to 'LATENT' dtype in Comfy, with Python dtype as `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`. It contains latent representations from the inference process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple function best on according to its usage tips?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple node, according to its usage tips, operates best on CPU infrastructure as indicated by the Infra type mentioned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'model' provided by Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple represent?",
        "answer": "The 'model' output provided by Inference_Core_ReferenceOnlySimple represents the processed model data after inference, structured in a format that encapsulates the results of the node's processing. It has the Comfy dtype `MODEL`."
