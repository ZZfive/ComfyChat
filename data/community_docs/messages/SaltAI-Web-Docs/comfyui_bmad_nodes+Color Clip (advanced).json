        "answer": "The 'Color Clip (advanced)' node in ComfyUI is used for adjusting the colors within an image based on a set of advanced criteria, including the ability to target specific colors for transformation or to apply complementary color adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Color Clip (advanced)' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'Color Clip (advanced)' node include 'image' (which is the image to be processed), 'target' (specifies the desired color transformation), 'complement' (determines the color transformation for areas not matching the reference color), and 'color' (the reference color guiding the clipping operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'target' parameter in 'Color Clip (advanced)' specify?",
        "answer": "The 'target' parameter in 'Color Clip (advanced)' specifies the desired color transformation for the targeted areas of the image, defining how the reference color areas should be altered."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Color Clip (advanced)' node in ComfyUI handle color transformations differently from basic color clipping?",
