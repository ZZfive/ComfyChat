        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node in ComfyUI is designed to determine the dimensions of an image, specifically its width and height, by analyzing the image's shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node requires an `image` input, which is the image whose size is to be determined. This input is crucial for calculating the image's dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the `image` input in the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `image` input in the GetImageSize node is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the GetImageSize node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node belongs to the `stability/image` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the GetImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node outputs two types: `width` and `height`. These represent the width and height of the input image, respectively, and are derived from its shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that the GetImageSize node uses to determine the image's size?",
        "answer": "The GetImageSize node uses the `get_size` function to determine the image's size. This function extracts the width and height from the shape of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly associated with the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The nodes commonly associated with the GetImageSize node in ComfyUI include the EmptyLatentImage node and the Reroute node."
