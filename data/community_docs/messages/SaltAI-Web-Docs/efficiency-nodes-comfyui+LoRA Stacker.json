        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoRA Stacker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoRA Stacker node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate and configure LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) parameters into a structured format, facilitating the manipulation and application of LoRA adjustments across different model components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `LORA_STACK` output type represent?",
        "answer": "The `LORA_STACK` output type represents a structured representation of LoRA parameters, ready for further processing or application within model components."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does `input_mode` influence the configuration of LoRA parameters?",
        "answer": "`input_mode` specifies the mode of input processing, which determines how LoRA parameters are aggregated and structured. It affects the configuration and representation of LoRA parameters in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `lora_count` define in the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "`lora_count` defines the number of LoRA adjustments to be considered, dictating the scale of aggregation and the number of parameters to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `lora_stack` in the input types of the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "`lora_stack` is an optional stack of pre-configured LoRA parameters that can be extended or modified with the current configuration, enhancing flexibility in LoRA parameter management."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The nodes commonly used with the LoRA Stacker node include the Efficient Loader, Eff. Loader SDXL, CR Apply LoRA Stack, and Reroute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python datatypes for the input `lora_wt_i` in the LoRA Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The Python datatype for the input `lora_wt_i` in the LoRA Stacker node is `float`."
