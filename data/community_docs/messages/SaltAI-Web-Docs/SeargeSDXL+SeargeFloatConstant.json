        "question": "What is the role of the SeargeFloatConstant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFloatConstant node in ComfyUI is designed to provide a constant floating-point value as specified by the user, serving as a simple utility to inject fixed numerical values into a data flow or computation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the input and output of the SeargeFloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for both the input and output of the SeargeFloatConstant node is FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'value' input and output of the SeargeFloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'value' input and output of the SeargeFloatConstant node is float."
