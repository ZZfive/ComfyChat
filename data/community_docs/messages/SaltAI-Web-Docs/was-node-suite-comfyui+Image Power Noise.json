        "question": "What is the 'Image Power Noise' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Power Noise' node in ComfyUI is used for generating a power noise image based on specified parameters such as width, height, frequency, attenuation, noise type, and a seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Image Power Noise' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Power Noise' node belongs to the category 'WAS Suite/Image/Generate/Noise' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the width of the generated noise image using the 'Image Power Noise' node?",
        "answer": "The width of the generated noise image can be specified by setting the 'width' parameter in the 'Image Power Noise' node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frequency' parameter in the 'Image Power Noise' node?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' parameter in the 'Image Power Noise' node controls the frequency of the noise pattern. Higher values result in more frequent changes in the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the 'width' and 'height' inputs in the 'Image Power Noise' node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the 'width' and 'height' inputs in the 'Image Power Noise' node is 'INT' in Comfy dtype and 'int' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can generate images with versatile noise patterns?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Power Noise' node in ComfyUI can generate images with versatile noise patterns by manipulating parameters such as width, height, frequency, attenuation, and noise type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'seed' parameter serve in the 'Image Power Noise' node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the 'Image Power Noise' node is a value that ensures reproducibility of the noise pattern during the generation process."
