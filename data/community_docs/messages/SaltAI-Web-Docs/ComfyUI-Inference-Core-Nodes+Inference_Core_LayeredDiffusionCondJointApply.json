        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node is used to apply conditional and joint layered diffusion processes for generating or manipulating images based on specific conditions and configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node are `model`, which is the model patcher used for the diffusion process, `image`, the target image for transformations, and `config`, a string that dictates the specific diffusion model and settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the configuration string determine in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The configuration string in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node determines the specific layered diffusion model and settings to use for image synthesis or transformation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node are `cond`, optional conditional inputs for targeted image manipulation, and `blended_cond`, optional blended conditional inputs for more complex image synthesis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` output represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The `model` output in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node represents the model after applying the layered diffusion process, equipped with modifications for image synthesis or transformation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LayeredDiffusionCondJoint class in the node's source code do?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionCondJoint class in the node's source code is designed to generate foreground and background images based on given inputs, applying layered diffusion to create blended images from foreground and background pieces."
