        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIP Vision Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Vision Input Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically select between two CLIP vision models based on a boolean condition, facilitating conditional processing of visual data within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `clip_vision_a` represent as an input type for the CLIP Vision Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "`clip_vision_a` represents the first CLIP vision model input type for the CLIP Vision Input Switch node, which acts as a potential input for the switch operation, and is selected when the boolean condition is True."
    },
    {
        "question": "What condition determines the output of the CLIP Vision Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the CLIP Vision Input Switch node in ComfyUI is determined by the boolean condition input. If the boolean value is True, 'clip_vision_a' is selected; otherwise, 'clip_vision_b' is selected for the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type is responsible for alternately selecting between two CLIP vision models in the CLIP Vision Input Switch node found in which category?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI's 'WAS Suite/Logic' category, the input type responsible for alternately selecting between two CLIP vision models is the boolean condition input that triggers the selection between 'clip_vision_a' and 'clip_vision_b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `clip_vision` output type of the CLIP Vision Input Switch node signify?",
        "answer": "The `clip_vision` output type of the CLIP Vision Input Switch node signifies the selected CLIP vision model based on the boolean condition, which facilitates conditional routing of visual model processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenario would you use the CLIP Vision Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Vision Input Switch node can be used in scenarios where conditional logic is needed for processing visual data, such as choosing between different vision models based on certain conditions or requirements in a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type for the CLIP Vision Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type for the CLIP Vision Input Switch node is specified as 'CPU', indicating that it is designed to operate efficiently on central processing units."
