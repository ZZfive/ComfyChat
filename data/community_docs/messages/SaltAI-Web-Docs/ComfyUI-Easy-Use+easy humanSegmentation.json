        "question": "What is the class name for the human segmentation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the human segmentation node in ComfyUI is `easy humanSegmentation`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the `easy humanSegmentation` node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy humanSegmentation` node belongs in the `EasyUse/Segmentation` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` parameter in the `easy humanSegmentation` node represent?",
        "answer": "The `image` parameter in the `easy humanSegmentation` node represents the input image that the node will process to segment human figures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `method` parameter in the `easy humanSegmentation` node, and what dtype is it in Comfy?",
        "answer": "The `method` parameter in the `easy humanSegmentation` node specifies the segmentation technique or model to be used, and it is of dtype `COMBO[STRING]` in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `confidence` parameter influence the output of the `easy humanSegmentation` node?",
        "answer": "The `confidence` parameter in the `easy humanSegmentation` node allows setting a threshold for the segmentation confidence level, filtering out less certain segments to ensure higher accuracy in the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the `easy humanSegmentation` node provide, and which dtype is associated with it?",
        "answer": "The `easy humanSegmentation` node provides `image` and `mask` outputs. The `image` output is of dtype `IMAGE`, and the `mask` output is of dtype `MASK` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `mask` output from the `easy humanSegmentation` node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` output from the `easy humanSegmentation` node offers a binary mask indicating the areas of the image corresponding to human figures, useful for various image editing and processing tasks."
