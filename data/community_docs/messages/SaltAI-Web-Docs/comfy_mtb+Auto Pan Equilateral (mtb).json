        "question": "What is the purpose of the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a 360-degree panning video from an equilateral image by transforming it based on field of view (FOV) parameters, elevation, and frame count, creating a seamless panoramic experience."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node require for transformation?",
        "answer": "The Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node requires an equilateral image (`equilateral_image`), which serves as the base for generating the panoramic frames, and fields of view (FOV) parameters (`fovX` and `fovY`), elevation (`elevation`), frame count (`frame_count`), width (`width`), and height (`height`) to specify the transformation details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs can the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node accept for dynamic effects?",
        "answer": "The Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node can accept optional lists of FOVX (`floats_fovX`), FOVY (`floats_fovY`), and elevation (`floats_elevation`) values to specify varying fields of view and elevation across frames, enabling dynamic panning effects in the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node in ComfyUI is an `IMAGE`, represented as a sequence of frames after applying the 360-degree panning transformation, with the dtype being `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can generate a 360 panning video?",
        "answer": "The Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node in ComfyUI can generate a 360 panning video from an equilateral image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node handle varying FOV parameters across different frames?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Auto Pan Equilateral (mtb) node can handle varying FOV parameters across different frames with the use of the optional `floats_fovX` and `floats_fovY` inputs."
