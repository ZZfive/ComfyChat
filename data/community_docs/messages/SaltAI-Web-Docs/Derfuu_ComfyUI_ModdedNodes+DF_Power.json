        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Power node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Power node in ComfyUI performs exponentiation, which raises a base value to the power of a specified exponent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Power node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DF_Power node are 'Value', which is the base value for the exponentiation operation, and 'Exponent', which specifies the power to which the base value is raised."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the base value in the context of the DF_Power node?",
        "answer": "In the context of the DF_Power node, the base value is the number being raised to the power of the exponent, determined by the 'Value' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the exponent value in the DF_Power node?",
        "answer": "The exponent value in the DF_Power node specifies the power to which the base value is raised, determined by the 'Exponent' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Power node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Power node is 'float', representing the result of raising the base value to the power of the exponent as a floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the DF_Power node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Power node is implemented by the 'PowNode' class in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find the source code for the DF_Power node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the DF_Power node can be found in the class definition of 'PowNode', which is used to perform the exponentiation operation in ComfyUI."
