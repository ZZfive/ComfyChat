        "question": "What category does CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation belongs to the category 'math/vec3'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation output?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation outputs a scalar value of type 'float' after performing the specified unary operation on the input 3-dimensional vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation require?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ToScalarUnaryOperation requires inputs of type 'op' and 'a'. 'op' specifies the unary operation to be applied, and 'a' is the 3-dimensional vector."
