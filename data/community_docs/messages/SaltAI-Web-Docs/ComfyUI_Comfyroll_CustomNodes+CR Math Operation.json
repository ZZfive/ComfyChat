        "question": "What is the CR Math Operation node?",
        "answer": "The CR Math Operation node is a custom node in ComfyUI that performs various mathematical operations on a given input value, including trigonometric functions, square root, exponentiation, logarithm, negation, and absolute value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can the CR Math Operation node perform?",
        "answer": "The CR Math Operation node can perform a variety of mathematical operations such as sin, cos, tan, sqrt (square root), exp (exponentiation), log (logarithm), neg (negation), and abs (absolute value)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the precision of the output from CR Math Operation be controlled?",
        "answer": "The precision of the output from the CR Math Operation node can be controlled by specifying the number of decimal places for the result, allowing for adjustments to the output's precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the mathematical operation in CR Math Operation?",
        "answer": "The mathematical operation performed by the CR Math Operation node is determined by the `operation` input, which specifies the mathematical transformation that the input value will undergo."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CR Math Operation handle the number of decimal places for the result?",
        "answer": "CR Math Operation handles the number of decimal places for the result through the `decimal_places` input, which specifies how many decimal places the output should be rounded to."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the CR Math Operation node?",
        "answer": "The CR Math Operation node outputs the result of the specified mathematical operation on the input value, rounded to the specified number of decimal places, and a help URL providing detailed information about supported operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find detailed information about CR Math Operation?",
        "answer": "Detailed information about the mathematical operations supported by the CR Math Operation node can be found at the URL https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/Other-Nodes#cr-math-operation."
