        "question": "What is the MotionDataVisualizer node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MotionDataVisualizer node is designed to transform motion data into a visual representation, allowing for the visualization of motion through various parameters such as distance, elevation, and rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the MotionDataVisualizer node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MotionDataVisualizer node belongs to the MotionDiff category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the crucial input that directly influences the visual output of the MotionDataVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The crucial input that directly influences the visual output of the MotionDataVisualizer node is the motion_data input, which can include joints information or require conversion from motion format to joints."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'visualization' input of the MotionDataVisualizer node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'visualization' input of the MotionDataVisualizer node affects the output by specifying the style of visualization to be applied to the motion data, which impacts the visual appearance and interpretability of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'distance' input on the output of the MotionDataVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The 'distance' input on the MotionDataVisualizer node controls the camera distance from the motion in the visualization, which impacts the scale and perspective of the visualized motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter adjusts the camera elevation angle in the MotionDataVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The 'elevation' parameter adjusts the camera elevation angle in the MotionDataVisualizer node, influencing the vertical angle and overall view of the motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rotation' parameter set in the MotionDataVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The 'rotation' parameter in the MotionDataVisualizer node sets the camera rotation angle around the motion in the visualization, affecting the orientation and angle of the visualized motion."
