        "question": "What is the purpose of the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a sequence of samples by gradually increasing the denoising strength applied to a latent image, allowing for controlled and incremental refinement of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node return?",
        "answer": "The KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node returns various outputs including the unchanged neural network model, positive conditioning information, negative conditioning information, the final latent representation of the image after the denoising process, and an optional VAE model if used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node include the model, positive and negative conditioning information, the latent image, seed, steps, cfg, sampler name, scheduler, start denoise, denoise increment, and denoise increment steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class name is related to the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name related to the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node in ComfyUI is `KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The category of the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node is `ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/others`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `denoise_increment` parameter in the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node?",
        "answer": "The `denoise_increment` parameter in the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node specifies the amount by which the denoising strength is increased at each step, controlling the pace of the denoising progression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs produced by the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The outputs produced by the KSampler Gradually Adding More Denoise (efficient) node include the unchanged model, positive conditioning (`CONDITIONING+`), negative conditioning (`CONDITIONING-`), the final latent representation of the image (`LATENT`), and an optional VAE (`VAE`) if used."
