        "question": "What is the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is designed to remove control networks from regional prompts within a given dataset, making it suitable for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node iterate over?",
        "answer": "The RemoveControlNet __Inspire node iterates over each regional prompt, extracting positive and negative conditioning texts to remove control networks from these texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the conditioning data input in the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the conditioning data input in the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is to provide the conditioning from which control network influences are to be removed, aiming to purify the conditioning for subsequent use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemoveControlNet __Inspire node is conditioning data with control networks removed, which is purified and ready for further processing."
