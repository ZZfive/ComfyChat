        "question": "What is the class name of the node that applies the Fooocus method for inpainting in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for applying Fooocus inpainting in ComfyUI is `INPAINT_ApplyFooocusInpaint`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Apply Fooocus Inpaint node falls under the category `inpaint` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node is to apply a specialized inpainting technique using the Fooocus method to enhance or modify images by integrating specific patches into the model's processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for the 'model' input in the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node requires the model to be patched with inpainting capabilities, allowing for the integration of Fooocus patches into its processing pipeline. Its Comfy dtype is `MODEL` and Python dtype is `ModelPatcher`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of outputs does the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Apply Fooocus Inpaint node generates the output of type `MODEL`, which is the model after applying the Fooocus inpainting patches, ready for further processing or generating inpainted images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which hardware type is required for the usage of the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Apply Fooocus Inpaint node requires the use of hardware type `GPU` for its operations in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node use the 'latent' input in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' input in the Apply Fooocus Inpaint node contains the latent representations and noise masks used to guide the inpainting process, influencing where and how inpainting is applied in the images in ComfyUI."
