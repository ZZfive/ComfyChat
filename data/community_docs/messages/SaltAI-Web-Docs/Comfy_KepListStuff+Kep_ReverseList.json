        "question": "What is the purpose of the Kep_ReverseList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Kep_ReverseList node is designed for reversing the order of elements in a list. It takes a list as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order, maintaining the original data types of the elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Kep_ReverseList node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Kep_ReverseList node is 'ReverseList'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Kep_ReverseList node accept as input?",
        "answer": "The Kep_ReverseList node accepts any type of list as input, which is represented by 'In'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'In' parameter represent in the Kep_ReverseList node?",
        "answer": "The 'In' parameter of the Kep_ReverseList node represents the input list to be reversed. This parameter is essential for the operation as it determines the sequence of elements that will be reversed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Kep_ReverseList node and what type of data is it?",
        "answer": "The output of the Kep_ReverseList node is a new list ('Reversed') with its elements in reverse order compared to the input list. It maintains the original data types of the elements and is represented in Python as `Tuple[List[Any]]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can the Kep_ReverseList node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Kep_ReverseList node can be found in the 'List Stuff' category of ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required to run the Kep_ReverseList node?",
        "answer": "The Kep_ReverseList node requires a CPU infrastructure type to run."
