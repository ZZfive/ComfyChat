        "question": "What is the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI is used to scale the bounding box of a segmentation element by a specified factor, adjusting the segmentation mask accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, what does the node ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT do to maintain the integrity of the segmentation element?",
        "answer": "The ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node ensures that the scaled bounding box and its corresponding mask are correctly aligned and sized, maintaining the integrity of the segmentation element."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required for the `seg` input of the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `seg` input of the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI requires a segmentation element whose bounding box is to be scaled, serving as the area of interest within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node scale the bounding box in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node scales the bounding box by using the `scale_by` input, which directly influences the size of the resulting bounding box and its associated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the `seg_elt` output in the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the `seg_elt` output in the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node of ComfyUI is SEG_ELT, representing the scaled segmentation element, including the adjusted bounding box and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `fill_zero_outside_bbox` function in the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `fill_zero_outside_bbox` function in the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node of ComfyUI is used to filling zero outside the bounding box on the mask, ensuring that the mask is correctly aligned with the bounding box."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImpactScaleBy_BBOX_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI is CPU."
