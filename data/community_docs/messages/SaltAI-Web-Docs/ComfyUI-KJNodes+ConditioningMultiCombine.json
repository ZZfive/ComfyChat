        "question": "What is the ConditioningMultiCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ConditioningMultiCombine is a node in ComfyUI designed to aggregate multiple conditioning inputs into a single, unified conditioning output. It facilitates complex conditioning scenarios by sequentially combining data from other conditioning nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ConditioningMultiCombine node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningMultiCombine node belongs to the 'KJNodes/masking/conditioning' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'inputcount' parameter play in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputcount' parameter in the ConditioningMultiCombine node specifies the number of conditioning inputs to be combined. It determines the execution flow by dictating how many conditioning inputs will be processed and merged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of data that 'conditioning_i' inputs accept in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning_i' inputs in the ConditioningMultiCombine node accept 'CONDITIONING' data types. They represent a series of conditioning inputs that start from 'conditioning_1' to 'conditioning_{inputcount}'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'combined' output represent in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'combined' output in the ConditioningMultiCombine node represents the result of combining the specified conditioning inputs into a single conditioning output, with the data type of 'CONDITIONING'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputcount' output return in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputcount' output in the ConditioningMultiCombine node returns the number of conditioning inputs that were combined, with the data type of 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the number of conditioning inputs in the ConditioningMultiCombine node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the number of conditioning inputs in the ConditioningMultiCombine node is 'int'."
