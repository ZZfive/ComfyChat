        "question": "What is the primary function of the StabilityAPI_SD3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StabilityAPI_SD3 node is designed to interface with the StabilityAI API, allowing for the generation of images or the application of transformations to existing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which API does the StabilityAPI_SD3 node interact with?",
        "answer": "The StabilityAPI_SD3 node interacts with the StabilityAI API, enabling users to generate or transform images without dealing with the complexities of the API directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required to guide the image generation process in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "A textual description or prompt is required to guide the image generation process, influencing the visual output based on the provided text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `n_prompt` input parameter specify in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "The `n_prompt` input parameter in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node specifies the number of prompts to be used, allowing for multiple prompts to influence the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the StabilityAPI_SD3 node control the randomness of image generation?",
        "answer": "The StabilityAPI_SD3 node includes a `seed` input, which is a seed value for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the format of the output image in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node?",
        "answer": "The format of the output image in the StabilityAPI_SD3 node is determined by the `output_format` input parameter, allowing users to choose between JPEG or PNG according to their preference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input does the StabilityAPI_SD3 node have that is crucial for authorized access to the StabilityAI API?",
        "answer": "The StabilityAPI_SD3 node has an optional input parameter `api_key`, which is the API key required for accessing the StabilityAI API, ensuring authorized use of the API for image generation and transformations."
