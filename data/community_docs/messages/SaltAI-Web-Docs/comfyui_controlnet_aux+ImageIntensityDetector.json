        "question": "What is the ImageIntensityDetector node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node is used for preprocessing images by adjusting their intensity levels through gamma correction to enhance the image's overall visibility and contrast before further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class is associated with the ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI is `ImageIntensityDetector`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does the ImageIntensityDetector node require as input?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node requires an input image (`image`), an optional gamma correction factor (`gamma_correction`), and an optional resolution (`resolution`) as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageIntensityDetector node adjust images?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node adjusts images by applying gamma correction to the input image, changing its intensity levels for improved visibility and contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What impact does the gamma_correction input have on an image?",
        "answer": "The gamma_correction input specifies the gamma correction factor to adjust the image's intensity. A higher gamma value brightens the image, while a lower value darkens it, significantly impacting the visual quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What resolution does the ImageIntensityDetector node default to if the `resolution` parameter is not specified?",
        "answer": "If the `resolution` parameter is not specified, the ImageIntensityDetector node defaults to a resolution of 512."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type produced by the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The output type produced by the ImageIntensityDetector node is an image with adjusted intensity levels (`IMAGE`), suitable for visual analysis or further image processing tasks."
