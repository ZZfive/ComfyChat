        "question": "What is the CR Image Output node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The CR Image Output node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the output of images within a computational graph, providing a streamlined way to export, display, or further process images generated or modified by preceding nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'images' parameter in the CR Image Output node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the CR Image Output node represents the image data to be outputted, playing a crucial role in determining the content and format of the output, affecting how images are processed and presented."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type does the 'images' input use in the CR Image Output node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the CR Image Output node uses the Python data type 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Image Output node handle the output operation, such as saving an image to disk?",
        "answer": "The CR Image Output node handles the output operation through the 'output_type' parameter, which specifies actions like saving an image to disk or displaying it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'filename_prefix' parameter in the CR Image Output node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter in the CR Image Output node is used to add a prefix to the filenames of saved images, aiding in organization and identification."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to save images in different formats when using ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Image Output node can be used to save images in formats like PNG or JPEG by using the 'file_format' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality triggered by the 'trigger' parameter in the CR Image Output node?",
        "answer": "The 'trigger' parameter in the CR Image Output node acts as a control signal that triggers the output operation, ensuring that images are processed and saved or displayed at the correct time."
