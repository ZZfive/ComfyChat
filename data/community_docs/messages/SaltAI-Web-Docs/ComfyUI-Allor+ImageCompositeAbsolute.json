    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageCompositeAbsolute handle?",
        "answer": "ImageCompositeAbsolute handles the precise placement and blending of two input images based on given coordinates, dimensions of the container, and a specified compositing method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageCompositeAbsolute?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageCompositeAbsolute include images_a, images_b, images_a_x, images_a_y, images_b_x, images_b_y, container_width, container_height, background, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageCompositeAbsolute handle the compositing of images?",
        "answer": "ImageCompositeAbsolute composites images by positioning them with respect to specified coordinates (images_a_x, images_a_y, images_b_x, images_b_y) within a container of specified dimensions (container_width, container_height), blending them based on the chosen compositing method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ImageCompositeAbsolute?",
