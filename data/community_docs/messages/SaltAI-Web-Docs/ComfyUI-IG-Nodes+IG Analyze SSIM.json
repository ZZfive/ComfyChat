        "question": "What is IG Analyze SSIM?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM is a custom node in ComfyUI that calculates the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) between consecutive images in a specified folder and visualizes these values through a plotted graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does IG Analyze SSIM output?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM outputs an image tensor that represents the plotted SSIM data between consecutive images. This output provides a visual summary of the similarity trends across the sequence of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IG Analyze SSIM determine the images to analyze?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM analyzes images located in a specified directory or folder provided as an input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for IG Analyze SSIM?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM requires a 'folder' parameter, which specifies the directory containing the images to be analyzed. This parameter is crucial for determining the set of images on which SSIM calculations are performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IG Analyze SSIM handle optional parameters ymin and ymax?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM allows customization of the SSIM plot by optionally setting ymin and ymax parameters, which adjust the vertical scale of the plotted SSIM data for better visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the plot generated by IG Analyze SSIM depict?",
        "answer": "The plot generated by IG Analyze SSIM shows the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) values between consecutive images, illustrating changes or variations in visual content across the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IG Analyze SSIM save SSIM data?",
        "answer": "IG Analyze SSIM saves calculated SSIM values to a JSON file located in the specified folder for future reference and analysis."
