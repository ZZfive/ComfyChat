        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Analyze SSIM node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node is designed to assess the similarity between consecutive images in a given folder using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'folder' parameter specify in the IG Analyze SSIM node?",
        "answer": "The 'folder' parameter specifies the directory containing the images to be analyzed for SSIM calculations and comparisons."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional parameters in the IG Analyze SSIM node and how are they used?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters 'ymin' and 'ymax' set the minimum and maximum values on the y-axis of the SSIM plot, allowing for customization of the plot's vertical scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does IG Analyze SSIM node produce?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node produces an 'IMAGE' output type, represented as a torch.Tensor, containing a graphical visualization of the SSIM values between consecutive images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the IG Analyze SSIM node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node belongs to the 'IG Nodes/Explorer' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What steps are involved in the process of assessing similarity between consecutive images using IG Analyze SSIM?",
        "answer": "The process involves calculating SSIM values for consecutive images, storing them, and then plotting these values using matplotlib to visualize similarity trends."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the IG Analyze SSIM node's function be extended to other types of analyses?",
        "answer": "The IG Analyze SSIM node's source code indicates it is specifically designed for SSIM analysis of consecutive images, but modifications to the source code could potentially extend its functionality."
