        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Cycle Images Simple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Images Simple node in ComfyUI is designed to cycle through a simple list of images in a sequential manner, based on the current frame and a specified frame interval, allowing for the creation of simple animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does CR Cycle Images Simple belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Cycle Images Simple belongs to the 'ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/ðŸŽ¥ Animation/ðŸ’€ Legacy' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of animation is supported by the CR Cycle Images Simple node?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Images Simple node supports simple animations by iterating over a collection of images a specified number of times (loops)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_interval' input type control in CR Cycle Images Simple?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' input type in CR Cycle Images Simple defines the number of frames to wait before transitioning to the next image in the sequence, allowing control over the animation speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' input affect the animation created by CR Cycle Images Simple?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' input in CR Cycle Images Simple determines how many times the list of images will be cycled through, enabling repeated animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'image_list_simple' input in CR Cycle Images Simple?",
        "answer": "The 'image_list_simple' input in CR Cycle Images Simple provides an alternative or additional set of images for the animation, allowing for more complex sequences beyond the fixed five image inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output of the CR Cycle Images Simple node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output of the CR Cycle Images Simple node provides a URL to additional help and information about the node for further assistance."
