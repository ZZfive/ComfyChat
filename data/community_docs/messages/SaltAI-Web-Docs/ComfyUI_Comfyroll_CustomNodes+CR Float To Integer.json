        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Float To Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Float To Integer node is designed to convert floating-point numbers to integers, providing a straightforward way to perform numerical type conversion within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the CR Float To Integer node require?",
        "answer": "The CR Float To Integer node requires a floating-point number (`_float`) as input, which is then converted to an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Float To Integer node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR Float To Integer node are `INT` for the converted integer result and `STRING` for a URL string pointing to additional documentation or help related to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `show_help` output in the CR Float To Integer node?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output in the CR Float To Integer node provides a link to additional documentation or help related to the node's functionality, which can be accessed as a URL string."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the conversion process from float to integer executed within the CR Float To Integer node?",
        "answer": "The conversion process from float to integer within the CR Float To Integer node is executed by simply converting the input `_float` using the built-in `int()` function in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is suitable for running the CR Float To Integer node?",
        "answer": "The CR Float To Integer node is suitable for running on CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide the source code for the CR Float To Integer node?",
        "answer": "The source code for the CR Float To Integer node includes a class `CR_FloatToInteger` with a method `convert` that performs the conversion from float to integer."
