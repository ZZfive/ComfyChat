        "question": "What is the CR Binary Pattern node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Binary Pattern node in ComfyUI is designed to generate complex binary patterns, offering a creative tool for generating intricate designs and textures based on binary logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the visual structure of the generated image by the CR Binary Pattern node?",
        "answer": "The visual structure of the generated image by the CR Binary Pattern node is determined by the binary pattern specified as a multiline string, where each line represents a row in the pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Binary Pattern node adjust the probability of a square being colored with 'color_1' over 'color_0'?",
        "answer": "The CR Binary Pattern node adjusts the probability of a square being colored with 'color_1' over 'color_0' using the 'bias' parameter, which allows for more control over the patternâ€™s appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input provides an alternative to the 'background_color' input for the CR Binary Pattern node?",
        "answer": "An optional hexadecimal value specified by 'bg_color_hex' provides an alternative to the 'background_color' input for the CR Binary Pattern node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the CR Binary Pattern node determines the outline color around each square in the pattern?",
        "answer": "The input 'outline_color' determines the color of the outline around each square in the pattern in the CR Binary Pattern node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'jitter_distance' input control in the CR Binary Pattern node?",
        "answer": "The 'jitter_distance' input in the CR Binary Pattern node controls the maximum distance that squares in the pattern can be randomly displaced to create a jitter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output does the CR Binary Pattern node provide that includes a URL to a help page?",
        "answer": "The CR Binary Pattern node provides a 'STRING' type output called 'show_help' that includes a URL to a help page providing additional information and guidance on using the binary pattern node."
