    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input for the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node in ComfyUI is the image to be normalized with the pixel values adjusted to fall within the -1 to 1 range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type of the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node is `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node normalize the images?",
        "answer": "The ImageNormalize_Neg1_To_1 node normalizes the images by multiplying the images by 2.0 and then subtracting 1.0 to adjust the pixel values to fall within the -1 to 1 range."
