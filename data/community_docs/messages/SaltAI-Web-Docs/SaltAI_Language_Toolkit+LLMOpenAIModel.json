        "question": "What is the `LLMOpenAIModel` class used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `LLMOpenAIModel` class in ComfyUI is used for integrating and utilizing OpenAI's language models, providing a streamlined interface for model loading and embedding. It simplifies the interaction with OpenAI's API for various applications like text generation and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `LLMOpenAIModel` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `LLMOpenAIModel` node include `model` specifying the OpenAI model to be loaded, `api_key` for authenticating requests, and `embedding_model` to define the specific embedding model to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `api_key` input in the `LLMOpenAIModel` node?",
        "answer": "The `api_key` input in the `LLMOpenAIModel` node is required for authenticating requests to OpenAI's services, ensuring secure access to the model loading functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input can expand the input types beyond text in the `LLMOpenAIModel` node?",
        "answer": "The optional `multimodal` input in the `LLMOpenAIModel` node is a boolean flag that, if set to True, indicates the model should support multimodal inputs, allowing for a broader range of input types beyond text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the `LLMOpenAIModel` node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the `LLMOpenAIModel` node include `llm_model` which returns the primary loaded language model with its configuration, and `embed_model_only` which provides the loaded embedding model separately, detailing its specific features."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can simplify the interaction with OpenAI's API for text-related applications?",
        "answer": "The `LLMOpenAIModel` node in ComfyUI can simplify the interaction with OpenAI's API for text-related applications by providing a streamlined interface for model loading and embedding, making it suitable for text generation and analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, how can you specify that the language model should support a range of input types beyond text?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, you can specify that the language model should support a range of input types beyond text by setting the optional `multimodal` input to True in the `LLMOpenAIModel` node."
