        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchAverageImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageImage node in ComfyUI is designed to apply statistical averaging operations, such as mean or median, across a batch of images to create a single representative image from a collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BatchAverageImage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BatchAverageImage node include a collection of images (`images`), which are represented as `torch.Tensor`s in Python, and an operation (`operation`), which specifies the type of averaging operation such as 'mean' or 'median'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchAverageImage node process a batch of images?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageImage node processes a batch of images by applying either the mean or median operation across the batch to calculate aggregate pixel values and produce a single representative image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `operation` parameter in BatchAverageImage control?",
        "answer": "The `operation` parameter in BatchAverageImage controls the type of averaging operation applied to the batch of images; it can be set to either 'mean' for calculating the average across pixel values or 'median' for finding the middle value in the sorted image batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BatchAverageImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BatchAverageImage node is an image (`IMAGE`), which is a `torch.Tensor` in Python, representing the average image that summarizes the statistics of the input image batch after applying the specified averaging operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for using the BatchAverageImage node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the BatchAverageImage node is GPU, enhancing the processing speed for averaging operations across a batch of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the BatchAverageImage node within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageImage node can be found in the 'image/filters' category within ComfyUI, indicating it is intended for image processing tasks."
