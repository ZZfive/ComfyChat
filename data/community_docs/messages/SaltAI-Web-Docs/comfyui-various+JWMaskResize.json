        "question": "What is the JWMaskResize node?",
        "answer": "JWMaskResize is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for resizing masks to specified dimensions, offering various interpolation modes to best suit the resizing needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the JWMaskResize node belong to?",
        "answer": "JWMaskResize belongs to the 'jamesWalker55' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' input represent in the JWMaskResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the JWMaskResize node is the input mask to be resized, which determines the content that will be resized and must be of type `MASK` or `torch.Tensor` according to the ComfyUI and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'height' input in the JWMaskResize node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'height' input in the JWMaskResize node directly influences the height of the output mask to the specified size, which must be of type `INT` or `int` according to the ComfyUI and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'width' input in the JWMaskResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in the JWMaskResize node directly influences the width of the output mask to the specified size, which must be of type `INT` or `int` according to the ComfyUI and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'interpolation_mode' input allow in the JWMaskResize node?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation_mode' input in the JWMaskResize node allows for flexibility in specifying the method of interpolation to be used during resizing, which must be of type `COMBO[STRING]` or `str` according to the ComfyUI and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the JWMaskResize node output?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskResize node outputs a resized mask, which is adjusted to the specified dimensions and uses the chosen interpolation method, and this output must be of type `MASK` or `torch.Tensor` according to the ComfyUI and Python data types."
