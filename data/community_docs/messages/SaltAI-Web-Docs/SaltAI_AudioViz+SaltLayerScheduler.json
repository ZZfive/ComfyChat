        "question": "What is the SaltLayerScheduler node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltLayerScheduler node is designed for scheduling parallax motion effects in audio-visual presentations, enabling dynamic camera movements that enhance the depth and immersion of the visual experience."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the speed of zooming in or out in the SaltLayerScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The `zoom_speed` input controls the speed of zooming in or out, affecting the perceived depth of the parallax effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `pan_speed` input specify in the SaltLayerScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The `pan_speed` input specifies the speed of panning, influencing the lateral movement in the parallax motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the frames at which the direction of panning changes defined in the SaltLayerScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The frames at which the direction of panning changes are defined by the `direction_change_frames` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input sets the scale of the 'tremor' effect in the SaltLayerScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The `tremor_scale` input sets the scale of the 'tremor' effect, adding a subtle shake to the parallax motion for realism."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the SaltLayerScheduler node determines the number of octaves for the tremor effect?",
        "answer": "The `tremor_octaves` input determines the number of octaves for the tremor effect, influencing its complexity and texture."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the scale of the initial horizontal placement of the camera set in the SaltLayerScheduler node?",
        "answer": "The initial horizontal placement of the camera, or starting X position, is set by the `start_x` input."
