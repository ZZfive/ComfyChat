        "question": "What is the purpose of the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node is to configure and apply a set of image preparation settings, including resizing, cropping, padding, interpolation, sharpening, and flipping, ensuring images are optimally prepared for further operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters does the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node use to control resizing?",
        "answer": "The Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node uses `target_w` and `target_h` parameters to specify the target width and height for the image after resizing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you adjust the alignment of an image using the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "You can adjust the alignment of an image using the `offset_w` and `offset_h` parameters in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node, which determine the horizontal and vertical offset applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, which node can be used for detailed cropping of images, specifying the amount from all sides?",
        "answer": "The Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node can be used for detailed cropping, as it provides parameters for specifying the crop amounts from the top, bottom, left, and right sides of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of padding can be added to an image using the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node, and how is it controlled?",
        "answer": "Padding can be added to the top, bottom, left, and right sides of an image using the `padding_top`, `padding_bottom`, `padding_left`, and `padding_right` parameters in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which specific dtype is associated with the `interpolation` setting in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `interpolation` setting in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node is associated with the `COMBO[STRING]` dtype, which defines the method used for resizing the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sharpening` parameter control in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `sharpening` parameter in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node controls the level of sharpening applied to the image, impacting edge definition and detail by enhancing them."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node handle image resizing methods, and which parameter is responsible for it?",
        "answer": "The Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node determines the method of resizing applied to the image through the `resize_type` parameter, which can be set to either 'Stretch' or 'Crop'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of image orientation adjustment, what does the 'flip' parameter in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node allow?",
        "answer": "The 'flip' parameter in the Prepare Image Plus (JPS) node allows the image to be flipped horizontally, vertically, or not at all, controlling the image's orientation."
