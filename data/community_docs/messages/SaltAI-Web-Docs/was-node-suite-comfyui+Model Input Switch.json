        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Model_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically select between two model inputs based on a boolean condition, providing flexible control flow within a pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Model Input Switch fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Input Switch falls under the category of `WAS Suite/Logic` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `boolean` input play in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node?",
        "answer": "The `boolean` input in the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node determines which model input (model_a or model_b) to pass through as the output, serving as a flag for the switch behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output `model` of the Model Input Switch represent?",
        "answer": "The output `model` of the Model Input Switch represents the selected model input based on the boolean condition, facilitating conditional model selection within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used for conditional model selection in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Input Switch node (WAS_Model_Input_Switch) is used for conditional model selection in ComfyUI, enabling the dynamic selection of models based on a boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, which node offers functionality for dynamically choosing between two model inputs?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the WAS_Model_Input_Switch node offers functionality for dynamically choosing between two model inputs based on a boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Model Input Switch choose between `model_a` and `model_b` in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Input Switch chooses between `model_a` and `model_b` in ComfyUI by evaluating the provided boolean condition; if the condition is true, it selects `model_a`; otherwise, it selects `model_b`."
