        "question": "What is LoraLoaderModelOnly?",
        "answer": "LoraLoaderModelOnly is a custom node in ComfyUI that specializes in loading LoRA models without requiring a CLIP model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does LoraLoaderModelOnly focus on?",
        "answer": "LoraLoaderModelOnly focuses on enhancing or modifying a given model based on LoRA parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for LoraLoaderModelOnly?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LoraLoaderModelOnly include: model (torch.nn.Module), lora_name (str), and strength_model (float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength_model' input determine?",
        "answer": "The 'strength_model' input determines the intensity of the LoRA adjustments applied to the model. A higher value indicates stronger modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of LoraLoaderModelOnly?",
        "answer": "The output type of LoraLoaderModelOnly is a modified model with LoRA adjustments applied, represented as a torch.nn.Module."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LoraLoaderModelOnly facilitate fine-tuned control over the model's behavior?",
        "answer": "LoraLoaderModelOnly facilitates fine-tuned control over the model's behavior by dynamically adjusting the model's strength through LoRA parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes related to LoraLoaderModelOnly?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes related to LoraLoaderModelOnly include: IPAdapterApplyFaceID, KSampler, FreeU_V2, and UltimateSDUpscale."
