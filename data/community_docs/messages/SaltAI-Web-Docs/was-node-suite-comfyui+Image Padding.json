        "question": "What is the Image Padding node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Padding node in ComfyUI is designed to modify the spatial dimensions of an image by adding padding around its edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the Image Padding node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Image Padding node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Transform` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `feathering` input in the Image Padding node?",
        "answer": "The `feathering` input determines the radius of the feathering effect applied at the edges of the padding, creating a smooth transition between the image and the padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `feather_second_pass` input control in the Image Padding node?",
        "answer": "The `feather_second_pass` input is a boolean flag indicating whether a second pass of padding adjustments should be applied, potentially refining the padding process for better visual results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the width of the padding to be added to the left side of the image using the Image Padding node?",
        "answer": "You can specify the width of the padding to be added to the left side of the image by setting the `left_padding` input parameter in the Image Padding node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the `image` input for the Image Padding node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input for the Image Padding node has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `PIL.Image.Image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Image Padding node generate?",
        "answer": "The Image Padding node generates an output of dtype `IMAGE`, which is the resulting image after padding has been applied, potentially including a feathered edge for smoother transitions."
