        "question": "What is GrowMask?",
        "answer": "GrowMask is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for modifying the size of a given mask, either expanding or contracting it, with optional tapered effects on the corners."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the GrowMask node modify?",
        "answer": "The GrowMask node modifies the size of a given mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the GrowMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GrowMask node include a mask (`MASK` type), an expand parameter (`INT` type), and a tapered_corners flag (`BOOLEAN` type)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the expand parameter affect the GrowMask node?",
        "answer": "The expand parameter in GrowMask determines whether the mask should be expanded (positive values) or contracted (negative values)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the tapered_corners flag do in the GrowMask node?",
        "answer": "The tapered_corners flag, when set to True, applies a tapered effect to the corners of the mask during modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the GrowMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the GrowMask node is a modified mask (`MASK` type) after applying the specified modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the FUNCTION attribute of the GrowMask class used for?",
        "answer": "The FUNCTION attribute 'expand_mask' in the GrowMask class defines the method responsible for expanding or contracting the input mask based on the parameters."
