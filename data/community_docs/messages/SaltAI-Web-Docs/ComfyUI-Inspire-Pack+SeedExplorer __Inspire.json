        "question": "What is the SeedExplorer __Inspire node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeedExplorer __Inspire node is used for exploring and manipulating seed values within a generative workflow in ComfyUI, allowing dynamic adjustment and application of seeds to influence the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SeedExplorer __Inspire node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeedExplorer __Inspire node belongs to the category 'InspirePack/Prompt' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input that represents the initial latent space or image data in SeedExplorer __Inspire?",
        "answer": "The primary input that represents the initial latent space or image data in SeedExplorer __Inspire is 'latent', and its Comfy dtype is 'LATENT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In SeedExplorer __Inspire, what is the purpose of the 'seed_prompt' input?",
        "answer": "The 'seed_prompt' input in SeedExplorer __Inspire is a string containing seed values and possibly other directives for generating variations. It is used to guide the generation process by specifying seed values and their intended effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the role of the 'enable_additional' input in SeedExplorer __Inspire.",
        "answer": "The 'enable_additional' input is a boolean flag in SeedExplorer __Inspire that enables or disables the application of additional seed and strength parameters for further manipulation of the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens in SeedExplorer __Inspire when 'additional_seed' and 'additional_strength' are set?",
        "answer": "In SeedExplorer __Inspire, setting 'additional_seed' and 'additional_strength' applies an additional seed value alongside the main seed prompt for enhanced control over the generation outcomes, allowing for further manipulation with a specified strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter determines the mode of seed application for the initial batch in SeedExplorer __Inspire?",
        "answer": "The 'initial_batch_seed_mode' parameter in SeedExplorer __Inspire determines the mode of seed application for the initial batch, influencing how seeds are applied and varied across multiple generations."
