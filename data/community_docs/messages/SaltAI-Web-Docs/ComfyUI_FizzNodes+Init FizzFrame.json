        "question": "What is the purpose of the Init FizzFrame node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Init FizzFrame node is designed to initialize the frame environment for further operations, setting up a foundational structure for managing and manipulating frame data within the FizzNodes framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in Init FizzFrame serves as the primary identifier for the frame being initialized?",
        "answer": "The 'frame' parameter serves as the primary identifier for the frame being initialized in Init FizzFrame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive_text' input parameter contribute to in Init FizzFrame?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_text' input parameter in Init FizzFrame contributes to the frame's overall positive context by allowing specification of positive aspects or attributes associated with the frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the positive and negative attributes applied across frames in the Init FizzFrame node?",
        "answer": "In Init FizzFrame, the 'general_positive' and 'general_negative' parameters allow for positive and negative contexts to be applied across frames, enhancing or negating aspects of the frame environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the Init FizzFrame node and its data type?",
        "answer": "The Init FizzFrame node returns a FizzFrame object, representing the initialized frame with its specified attributes and contexts. The data type for the output is `FIZZFRAME`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'previous_frame' parameter in Init FizzFrame?",
        "answer": "The 'previous_frame' parameter in Init FizzFrame is used to reference a prior frame, allowing for the continuation or modification of its context in the current frame initialization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of information does the 'clip' parameter in Init FizzFrame include?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter in Init FizzFrame is intended for including CLIP model information, which can be utilized for further processing or conditioning of the frame data."
