    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` input of the ttN KSampler_v2 node specify?",
        "answer": "The `model` input of the ttN KSampler_v2 node specifies the generative model to be used for sampling, which is crucial as it determines the underlying mechanism and the quality of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `lora_strength` parameter control in ttN KSampler_v2?",
        "answer": "The `lora_strength` parameter in ttN KSampler_v2 determines the strength of the LoRA adjustments applied during the sampling process, influencing the sampling modifications according to the specified LoRA model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `upscale_method` input in ttN KSampler_v2?",
        "answer": "The `upscale_method` input in ttN KSampler_v2 specifies the method used for upscaling images in the sampling process, allowing for various interpolation techniques to adjust the size of images as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `rescale` input affect the images in ttN KSampler_v2?",
        "answer": "The `rescale` input in ttN KSampler_v2 determines whether and how images are rescaled during the sampling process, offering options such as rescaling by percentage, to a specified width and height, or to the longer side while maintaining aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ttN KSampler_v2, what is returned by the `image` output type?",
        "answer": "The `image` output type in ttN KSampler_v2 returns the generated image or images from the sampling process, providing the visual output of the generative modeling task."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific sampling algorithm is selected by the `sampler_name` input in ttN KSampler_v2?",
        "answer": "The `sampler_name` input in ttN KSampler_v2 determines the specific sampling algorithm to be used, impacting the efficiency and characteristics of the sampling process, selected from a list of available sampling methods provided by ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `cfg` input in ttN KSampler_v2?",
        "answer": "The `cfg` input in ttN KSampler_v2 controls the conditioning factor, influencing the direction and space of the sampling process by adjusting the guidance scale."
