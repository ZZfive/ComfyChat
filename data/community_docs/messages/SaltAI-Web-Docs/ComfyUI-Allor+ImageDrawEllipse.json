        "question": "What is ImageDrawEllipse?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawEllipse is a class in ComfyUI designed for drawing ellipses on images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageDrawEllipse belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawEllipse belongs to the category 'image/draw' within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageDrawEllipse node allow you to customize?",
        "answer": "The ImageDrawEllipse node allows customization of the ellipse's outline and fill colors, size, position, and anti-aliasing for higher quality rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageDrawEllipse node?",
        "answer": "The input types required by the ImageDrawEllipse node include width, height, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, outline_size, outline_red, outline_green, outline_blue, outline_alpha, fill_red, fill_green, fill_blue, fill_alpha, SSAA, and method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SSAA affect the output of the ImageDrawEllipse node?",
        "answer": "SSAA (supersampling anti-aliasing) enhances the quality of the ellipse's rendering by smoothing edges and reducing aliasing artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SSAA parameter specify in ImageDrawEllipse?",
        "answer": "The SSAA parameter specifies the level of supersampling anti-aliasing applied, influencing the rendering quality of the ellipse."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageDrawEllipse node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageDrawEllipse node is an image tensor (torch.Tensor) containing the drawn ellipse."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the method parameter affect the resizing of the image in ImageDrawEllipse?",
        "answer": "The method parameter in ImageDrawEllipse defines the method used for resizing the image after drawing the ellipse, impacting the final image quality."
