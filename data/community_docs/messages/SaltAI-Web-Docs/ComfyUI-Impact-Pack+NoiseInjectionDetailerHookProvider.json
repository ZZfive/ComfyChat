        "question": "What is the purpose of the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node in ComfyUI is designed to inject noise into the detailer process, enhancing control over the noise characteristics throughout the cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node produce?",
        "answer": "The NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node produces a detailer hook of type DETAILER_HOOK, configured for noise injection, ready to be integrated into the detailer process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node are schedule_for_cycle (COMBO[STRING]), source (COMBO[STRING]), seed (INT), start_strength (FLOAT), and end_strength (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the schedule_for_cycle input used in the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider?",
        "answer": "The schedule_for_cycle input specifies the schedule to be used for the noise injection cycle in the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider, influencing how noise characteristics are adjusted over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the seed input in the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The seed input in the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node is a seed value for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node dynamically adjust the noise strength?",
        "answer": "The NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node can dynamically adjust the noise strength by using start_strength (the initial strength of the noise) and end_strength (the final strength of the noise) inputs, allowing for progressive changes based on the cycle's progress."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for the NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider node operates optimally on the CPU infrastructure type."
