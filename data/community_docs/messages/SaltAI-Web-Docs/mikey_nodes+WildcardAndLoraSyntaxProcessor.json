        "question": "What is the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to process text inputs by identifying and handling both wildcard and Lora syntax patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node include `model`, `clip`, `text`, and `seed`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' parameter represent in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter represents the model that may be adjusted based on Lora syntax within the input text, allowing for dynamic model manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'clip' parameter in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter represents the clip model that may be adjusted alongside the main model in response to Lora syntax within the input text, facilitating coordinated model adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'unprocessed_text' output provide in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'unprocessed_text' output in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node provides the original input text before any processing of wildcard or Lora syntax patterns, preserving the initial state for reference or further use."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which methods does the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node use to process Lora syntax within the text?",
        "answer": "The WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node uses methods such as `extract_and_load_loras`, `process`, `search_and_replace`, `process_random_syntax`, `find_and_replace_wildcards`, to process Lora syntax within the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'text' parameter in the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter is the primary input text that the WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node processes. It is crucial for the operation as it contains the wildcard and Lora syntax patterns that need to be identified and handled."
