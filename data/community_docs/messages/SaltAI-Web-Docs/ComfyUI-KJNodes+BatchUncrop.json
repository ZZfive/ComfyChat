        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchUncrop node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchUncrop node in ComfyUI is designed to reverse the cropping process on a batch of images, taking original images and their cropped versions along with cropping metadata to reconstruct the images with the cropped areas seamlessly integrated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the BatchUncrop node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the BatchUncrop node are original_images, cropped_images, bboxes, border_blending, crop_rescale, border_top, border_bottom, border_left, and border_right."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the border_blending input control in BatchUncrop?",
        "answer": "The border_blending input controls the blending of borders during the uncropping process in the BatchUncrop node to ensure seamless integration of the borders."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_rescale input do in BatchUncrop?",
        "answer": "The crop_rescale input in the BatchUncrop node indicates whether the cropped images should be rescaled to their original size before uncropping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the border_top input specify in BatchUncrop?",
        "answer": "The border_top input specifies whether to apply a top border during the uncropping process in the BatchUncrop node, with the data type being BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node in ComfyUI can be used to reverse cropping on images?",
        "answer": "The BatchUncrop node in ComfyUI can be used to reverse the cropping process on images, adjusting for borders and scaling as necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BatchUncrop node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BatchUncrop node is the original images with the cropped areas seamlessly integrated, provided in the Comfy dtype IMAGE, and the Python dtype List[torch.Tensor]."
