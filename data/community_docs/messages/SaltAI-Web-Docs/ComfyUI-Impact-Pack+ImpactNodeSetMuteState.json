        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNodeSetMuteState node in ComfyUI is designed to control the mute state of other nodes within a workflow, allowing for enhanced flexibility and control over the workflow's execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node belong to in ComfyUI's ImpactPack?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNodeSetMuteState node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test' category in ComfyUI's ImpactPack."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node receive the signal to initiate the mute or activation process?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNodeSetMuteState node receives the signal to initiate the mute or activation process through its generic signal input, which is essential for triggering the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the target node for the mute or activation command in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node?",
        "answer": "The target node for the mute or activation command in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node is determined by the 'node_id' input, which specifies the unique identifier of the node whose mute state is to be controlled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'set_state' input in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'set_state' input in the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node is a boolean value that indicates the desired mute state; when true, the target node is activated; when false, it is muted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node return after execution?",
        "answer": "After execution, the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node returns the original signal input, which allows for seamless integration into the workflow without altering the data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactNodeSetMuteState node in ComfyUI's ImpactPack use?",
        "answer": "The ImpactNodeSetMuteState node in ComfyUI's ImpactPack uses the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
