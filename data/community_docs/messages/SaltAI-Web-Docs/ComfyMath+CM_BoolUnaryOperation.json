        "question": "What is `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "`CM_BoolUnaryOperation` is a node in ComfyUI used for performing unary boolean operations on a given boolean value, such as logical NOT, in a mathematical or logical context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines how the input boolean value is manipulated in the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node?",
        "answer": "The input boolean value is manipulated based on the operation specified by the `op` input, which can be 'Not', determining how the boolean input is operated on."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node include `op`, which specifies the unary boolean operation, and `a`, the boolean value to be operated on."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can the `op` input of the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node specify?",
        "answer": "The `op` input of the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node can specify operations such as 'Not' for performing logical negation on the boolean input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node output?",
        "answer": "The `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node outputs a boolean result of the unary boolean operation performed on the input value, with the Comfy dtype `BOOL` and the Python dtype `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the `BoolUnaryOperation` class?",
        "answer": "The `BoolUnaryOperation` class falls under the category `math/bool` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of inputs `op` and `a` in the `CM_BoolUnaryOperation` node and their Python data types?",
        "answer": "The input `op` is of Comfy dtype `COMBO[STRING]` and Python dtype `List[str]`, while the input `a` is of Comfy dtype `BOOL` and Python dtype `bool`."
