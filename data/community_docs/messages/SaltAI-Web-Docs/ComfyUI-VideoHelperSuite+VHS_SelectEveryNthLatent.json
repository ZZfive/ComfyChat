        "question": "What is the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent is designed to filter through a batch of latents, selecting every Nth latent according to a specified interval for more efficient processing or targeted analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent to determine which latents will be selected?",
        "answer": "The input latents (`latents`) are crucial for VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent as they determine which latents will be processed and ultimately selected based on the interval."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node influence the output latent batch density?",
        "answer": "VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent influences the output latent batch density by thinning it out based on the interval specified by the `select_every_nth` input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `select_every_nth` input do in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node?",
        "answer": "The `select_every_nth` input in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node specifies the interval at which latents are selected, directly influencing the density of the output latent batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of dtype does ComfyUI expect for the `latents` input in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI expects the dtype `LATENT` for the `latents` input in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional output does VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent provide besides the filtered set of latents?",
        "answer": "In addition to the filtered set of latents, VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent provides the total count of latents selected after applying the specified interval, which is returned as a separate output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the `latents` input in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `latents` input in the VHS_SelectEveryNthLatent node is `dict`."
