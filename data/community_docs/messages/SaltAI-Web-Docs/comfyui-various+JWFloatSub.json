        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatSub node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatSub node is designed to perform subtraction between two floating-point numbers, providing a straightforward way to calculate the difference between values in a computational graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Float Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Float Subtract node is `JWFloatSub`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does JWFloatSub belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "JWFloatSub belongs to the category `jamesWalker55` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `a` input represent in the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The `a` input in the JWFloatSub node represents the minuend in the subtraction operation, essentially the number from which another number (the subtrahend) is to be subtracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `b` input in the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `b` input in the JWFloatSub node is `FLOAT`. In Python, this corresponds to the `float` data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWFloatSub node is the result of the subtraction operation between two floating-point numbers, with a Comfy dtype of `FLOAT` and Python dtype of `tuple[float]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is recommended for the operation of the JWFloatSub node?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatSub node is recommended to be operated on an `CPU` infrastructure."
