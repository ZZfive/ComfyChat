        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Image_Blank node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Image_Blank node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a blank image with specified dimensions and color. It enables the creation of simple, solid-colored images by defining their width, height, and RGB color values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the WAS_Image_Blank node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the WAS_Image_Blank node include `width`, `height`, `red`, `green`, and `blue`. These inputs specify the dimensions and color of the generated image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `width` input type determine when using the WAS Image Blank node?",
        "answer": "The `width` input type specifies the width of the generated image in the WAS Image Blank node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `red` input contribute to in the WAS Image Blank node?",
        "answer": "The `red` input in the WAS Image Blank node determines the red component of the image's color, contributing to the customization of its appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the WAS Image Blank node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the WAS Image Blank node is `IMAGE`, which represents a blank image with the specified dimensions and color. The output image is compatible with the `IMAGE` data type in Comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the output of the WAS Image Blank node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the output of the WAS Image Blank node is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WAS Image Blank node adjust the width and height inputs to ensure they are multiples of 8?",
        "answer": "The WAS Image Blank node adjusts the width and height inputs by rounding the dimensions down to the nearest multiple of 8 to ensure they are compatible with further processing in ComfyUI."
