        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is designed to select a specific preprocessor for use in ControlNet operations, allowing for dynamic adaptation of preprocessing strategies based on user input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node requires the 'preprocessor' input, which specifies the preprocessor to be selected for the operation, enabling dynamic adaptation to various preprocessing needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is 'preprocessor', which returns the selected preprocessor, facilitating its application in subsequent ControlNet operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node designed for CPU or GPU operation?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node is designed to operate on the CPU as it is classified under the Infra type 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class in ComfyUI is responsible for selecting a preprocessing method for ControlNet?",
        "answer": "The class responsible for selecting a preprocessing method for ControlNet in ComfyUI is the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node belong to in the ComfyUI category system?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node belongs to the category 'ControlNet Preprocessors' in the ComfyUI category system."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node facilitate preprocessing in ControlNet?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetPreprocessorSelector node facilitates preprocessing in ControlNet by dynamically selecting a specific preprocessor based on user input, which can then be applied in ControlNet operations to adapt to various preprocessing needs."
