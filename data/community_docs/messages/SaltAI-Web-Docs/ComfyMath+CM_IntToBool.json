        "question": "What is CM_IntToBool?",
        "answer": "CM_IntToBool is a custom node in ComfyUI that converts an integer input into a boolean output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_IntToBool do?",
        "answer": "CM_IntToBool converts numerical values into binary conditions based on their equivalence to zero, outputting a boolean result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_IntToBool handle its input?",
        "answer": "CM_IntToBool takes an integer input 'a'. If 'a' is non-zero, the output is True; otherwise, it is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CM_IntToBool?",
        "answer": "CM_IntToBool outputs a boolean (BOOL) result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_IntToBool belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_IntToBool belongs to the category 'math/conversion' in ComfyUI."

        "answer": "Common nodes associated with CM_IntToBool are currently unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide an example of how CM_IntToBool operates?",
        "answer": "For example, if the input integer 'a' is 0, CM_IntToBool would output False; if 'a' is any non-zero value, it would output True."
