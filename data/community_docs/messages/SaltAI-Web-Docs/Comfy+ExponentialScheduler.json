        "question": "What is ExponentialScheduler?",
        "answer": "ExponentialScheduler is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for generating a sequence of sigma values following an exponential schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ExponentialScheduler belong to?",
        "answer": "ExponentialScheduler belongs to the 'sampling/custom_sampling/schedulers' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ExponentialScheduler output?",
        "answer": "ExponentialScheduler outputs a sequence of sigma values (sigmas) calculated based on an exponential schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ExponentialScheduler?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ExponentialScheduler are: 'steps' (INT), 'sigma_max' (FLOAT), and 'sigma_min' (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ExponentialScheduler determine the length of the sigma sequence?",
        "answer": "ExponentialScheduler determines the length of the sigma sequence based on the 'steps' input, which specifies the total number of steps for the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigma_max' input represent in ExponentialScheduler?",
        "answer": "'sigma_max' in ExponentialScheduler defines the maximum sigma value, setting the upper limit of noise introduced at the beginning of the diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ExponentialScheduler calculate the sigma values?",
        "answer": "ExponentialScheduler calculates sigma values using an exponential schedule function provided by k_diffusion_sampling.get_sigmas_exponential, based on the inputs 'steps', 'sigma_max', and 'sigma_min'."
