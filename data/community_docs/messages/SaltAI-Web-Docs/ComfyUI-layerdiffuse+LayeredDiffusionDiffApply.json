        "question": "What is the purpose of the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node is used to apply a layered diffusion process to an input, utilizing a specific configuration and weight to modify the diffusion behavior in a controlled and customizable manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node falls under the category of layer_diffuse."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'model' input in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'model' input in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node is MODEL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'weight' input in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'weight' input in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'config' input specify in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'config' input in the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node specifies the string identifier for the layered diffusion configuration to be applied, dictating the specific diffusion process and parameters to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node produce?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDiffApply node produces outputs of type MODEL and CONDITIONING. The 'model' output is the modified model after the layered diffusion process has been applied, and the 'conditioning' output includes the modified or additional context used during the diffusion process."
