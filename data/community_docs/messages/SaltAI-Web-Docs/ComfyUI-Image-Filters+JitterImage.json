        "question": "What is the JitterImage node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JitterImage node in ComfyUI is used to apply a jitter effect to images, transforming them through a series of affine transformations to simulate camera or object movement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the JitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The JitterImage node requires two inputs: `images`, which are the input images to be transformed, and `jitter_scale`, which defines the scale of the jitter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the JitterImage node described in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the JitterImage node is an `IMAGE` type, representing the images after the jitter effect has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific parameter is adjustable by the user to control the jitter effect?",
        "answer": "The `jitter_scale` parameter is adjustable by the user and is used to define the scale of the jitter effect, adjusting the intensity of the transformations applied to the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What visual simulations can the JitterImage node create?",
        "answer": "The JitterImage node can simulate camera or object movement by applying a jitter effect that transforms the images through a series of affine transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category of nodes is JitterImage found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "JitterImage is categorized under `image/filters/jitter` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of transformations does the JitterImage node apply to the images?",
        "answer": "The JitterImage node applies a series of affine transformations to the images, which helps in simulating camera or object movement as well as enhancing the robustness of models to variations in input data or for data augmentation."
