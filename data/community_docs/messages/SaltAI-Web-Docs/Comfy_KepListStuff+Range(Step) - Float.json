        "question": "What is the Range(Step) - Float node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Float node in ComfyUI generates a sequence of floating-point numbers within a specified range, allowing for precise control over the start, stop, and step values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Range(Step) - Float node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Float node belongs to the 'List Stuff' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' input represent in the Range(Step) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'start' input in the Range(Step) - Float node specifies the starting value of the range, setting the lower bound for the sequence of generated numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'stop' input utilized by the Range(Step) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'stop' input in the Range(Step) - Float node defines the ending value of the range, setting the upper limit for the sequence of generated numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'step' input play in the Range(Step) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input in the Range(Step) - Float node determines the increment between each number in the range, controlling the spacing between consecutive numbers in the generated sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'end_mode' input control in the Range(Step) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'end_mode' input in the Range(Step) - Float node indicates whether the stop value is inclusive or exclusive in the range, affecting whether the final number in the sequence reaches or excludes the stop value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Range(Step) - Float node provide and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Float node outputs a 'range', which is the generated sequence of floating-point numbers within the specified range, and 'range_sizes', indicating the number of elements in each sequence."
