        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactCompare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node is designed to perform a variety of comparison operations between two input values, enabling dynamic decision-making processes within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImpactCompare node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node belongs to the category 'ImpactPack/Logic'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the 'cmp' parameter in the ImpactCompare node require?",
        "answer": "The 'cmp' parameter requires a Comfy dtype of `COMBO[STRING]` and a Python dtype of `List[str]`, specifying the type of comparison to perform such as equality, inequality, or greater than."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactCompare node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node outputs a boolean value with a Comfy dtype of `BOOLEAN`, representing the result of the comparison operation between two input values."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype is associated with the 'a' and 'b' input parameters in the ImpactCompare node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' and 'b' input parameters in the ImpactCompare node have a Python dtype of `impact.utils.any_typ`, indicating they can accept any type of value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactCompare node handle comparisons if 'cmp' is set to 'tt' or 'ff'?",
        "answer": "When 'cmp' is set to 'tt', the ImpactCompare node returns True directly, and when 'cmp' is set to 'ff', it returns False, bypassing the comparison of input values 'a' and 'b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the ImpactCompare node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The ImpactCompare node is optimized for 'CPU' infrastructure, making it suitable for logical operations that do not require intense CPU processing."
