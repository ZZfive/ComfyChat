    {
        "question": "What input type is required by the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is the 'image' input, which represents the input image to be processed for depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'environment' optional input in the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'environment' input in the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node determines the choice of pretrained model for depth estimation, selecting between indoor and outdoor environments to optimize depth map accuracy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'resolution' input have on the output of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the depth estimation should be performed, directly affecting the output depth map's resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is 'image', representing a depth map of the input image, providing a pixel-wise estimation of depth values."
