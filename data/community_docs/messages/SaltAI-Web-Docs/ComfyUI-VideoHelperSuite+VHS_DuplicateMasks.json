        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_DuplicateMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_DuplicateMasks node in ComfyUI is designed to replicate a given mask tensor a specified number of times, creating a batch of identical masks for operations such as batch processing or data augmentation in video and image editing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the VHS_DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the VHS_DuplicateMasks node are `mask`, which is a tensor (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), and `multiply_by`, an integer that specifies the number of times the mask should be duplicated (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the central parameter to the operation of the VHS_DuplicateMasks node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The central parameter is `mask`, which represents the input tensor to be duplicated. It defines the mask that will be replicated across the new batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `multiply_by` parameter do in the VHS_DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The `multiply_by` parameter in the VHS_DuplicateMasks node specifies the number of times the input mask should be duplicated, allowing for dynamic batch size adjustment based on workflow needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the VHS_DuplicateMasks node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the VHS_DuplicateMasks node are `MASK`, which is the duplicated mask batch consisting of multiple copies of the input mask (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), and `count`, the total number of masks in the duplicated batch (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can be used for creating a batch of identical masks?",
        "answer": "The VHS_DuplicateMasks node can be used in ComfyUI for creating a batch of identical masks by duplicating the input mask tensor a specified number of times."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the VHS_DuplicateMasks node in ComfyUI's node categories?",
        "answer": "The VHS_DuplicateMasks node belongs to the 'Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/mask' category in ComfyUI."
