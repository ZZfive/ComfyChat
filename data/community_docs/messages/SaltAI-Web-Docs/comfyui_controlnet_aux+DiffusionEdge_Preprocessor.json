        "question": "What is the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is used for preprocessing images to extract edge maps using a diffusion-based edge detection model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node belongs to the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input image's data type in the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The input image's data type for the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node is IMAGE in ComfyUI and PIL.Image in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the environment for the model used by the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The environment for the model used by the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node can be specified using the 'environment' optional input, which supports 'indoor', 'urban', or 'natrual'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does adjusting the patch_batch_size have on the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the patch_batch_size affects the speed and VRAM usage of the edge detection operation in the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the resolution input in the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node control?",
        "answer": "The resolution input in the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node controls the resolution to which the input image is resized before edge detection, affecting the detail level of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node produce?",
        "answer": "The DiffusionEdge_Preprocessor node produces an IMAGE type output in ComfyUI, which is the edge-detected image suitable for further processing or visualization."
