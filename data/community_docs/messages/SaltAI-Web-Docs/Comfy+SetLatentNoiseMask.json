        "question": "What is SetLatentNoiseMask?",
        "answer": "SetLatentNoiseMask is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to apply a noise mask to a set of latent samples, modifying their noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SetLatentNoiseMask modify?",
        "answer": "SetLatentNoiseMask modifies latent samples by integrating a specified noise mask, which alters their noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by SetLatentNoiseMask?",
        "answer": "SetLatentNoiseMask requires 'samples' as latent samples to which the noise mask will be applied, and 'mask' which defines the areas and intensity of noise alteration within the samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of SetLatentNoiseMask?",
        "answer": "The output type of SetLatentNoiseMask is 'latent', which provides modified latent samples with the applied noise mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does SetLatentNoiseMask belong to?",
        "answer": "SetLatentNoiseMask belongs to the category 'latent/inpaint' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SetLatentNoiseMask integrate the noise mask?",
        "answer": "SetLatentNoiseMask integrates the noise mask by applying it to the latent samples, adjusting their noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes associated with SetLatentNoiseMask?",
        "answer": "Common nodes associated with SetLatentNoiseMask include KSampler and KSampler (Efficient), which are used in similar contexts within ComfyUI."
