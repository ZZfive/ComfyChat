        "question": "What is the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ControlNetHadamard (manual) is a custom node in ComfyUI that applies a control network to a set of images based on provided conditions and a specified strength. It modifies the images' conditioning for further processing using the Hadamard product concept."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node is `ControlNetHadamard (manual)`, and it belongs to the category `Bmad/conditioning`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conds' input in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'conds' input in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node represents the conditions to apply to each image, determining how the control network modifies the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'control_net' input in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'control_net' input in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node is `CONTROL_NET`, which is a PyTorch Module that dictates the nature of the modifications applied to the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'strength' parameter used in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node is a scalar value that determines the intensity of the control network's effect on the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node in ComfyUI is `conditioning`, which represents the modified conditions after applying the control network to the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' input represent in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' input in the ControlNetHadamard (manual) node specifies the number of images to be processed and allows for dynamic adjustment based on input."
