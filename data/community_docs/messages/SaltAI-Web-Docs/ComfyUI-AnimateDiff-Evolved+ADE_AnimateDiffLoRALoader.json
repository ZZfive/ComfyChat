        "question": "What is ADE_AnimateDiffLoRALoader?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffLoRALoader is a node in ComfyUI designed to load motion LoRA configurations for animation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ADE_AnimateDiffLoRALoader belong to?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffLoRALoader belongs to the category 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_name' input specify?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' input specifies the name of the motion LoRA to be loaded, crucial for identifying the specific LoRA configuration to apply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' input determine?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input determines the intensity of the motion LoRA effect, allowing fine-tuning of the animation's dynamics."
    },
    {

        "answer": "The output type of ADE_AnimateDiffLoRALoader is 'MOTION_LORA'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prev_motion_lora' input enable?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_motion_lora' input enables the chaining or layering of motion LoRA effects for more complex animations, though it is optional."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'load_motion_lora' function?",
        "answer": "The 'load_motion_lora' function loads a motion LoRA configuration identified by 'lora_name' with a specified 'strength', incorporating it into a provided or new MotionLoraList."
