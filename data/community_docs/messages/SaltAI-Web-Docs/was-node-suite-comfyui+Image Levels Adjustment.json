        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI is designed to modify the tonal range of an image by adjusting its black, mid, and white levels, enhancing the visual quality of the image by altering its contrast and brightness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Levels Adjustment node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Levels Adjustment node are `image`, which is the input image to be adjusted (torch.Tensor), `black_level` (FLOAT) specifying the minimum intensity value of pixels, `mid_level` (FLOAT) defining the midpoint intensity value, and `white_level` (FLOAT) setting the maximum intensity value for pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which common nodes can be used with the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that can be used with the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI include CR Image Output, PreviewImage, and Image To Mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of adjusting the `black_level` input on an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the `black_level` input on an image in ComfyUI affects the overall darkness of the image, enhancing details in darker regions by specifying the minimum intensity value that pixels should have."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI alter the image's contrast?",
        "answer": "The Image Levels Adjustment node alters the image's contrast by adjusting the `mid_level`, which significantly affects the image's tonal range and thus its contrast and overall visual appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI is the adjusted image with modified black, mid, and white levels (torch.Tensor), reflecting the changes made to the image's tonal range and enhanced visual quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype corresponds to the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` for the input and output of the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype that corresponds to the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` for the input and output of the Image Levels Adjustment node in ComfyUI is `torch.Tensor`."
