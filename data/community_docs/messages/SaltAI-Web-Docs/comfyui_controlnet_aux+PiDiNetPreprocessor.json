        "question": "What class in ComfyUI is designed for extracting soft-edge lines from images?",
        "answer": "The PiDiNetPreprocessor class is designed for extracting soft-edge lines from images in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a PiDiNetPreprocessor used for in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "A PiDiNetPreprocessor is used for preprocessing images to extract soft-edge lines, utilizing the PiDiNet model, in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is required for the PiDiNetPreprocessor to function?",
        "answer": "The required node for the PiDiNetPreprocessor to function is the `image` node, which represents the input image to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input nodes for the PiDiNetPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The optional input nodes for the PiDiNetPreprocessor are `safe` and `resolution`. The `safe` node is a mode selector and the `resolution` node specifies the processing resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `resolution` node control in the PiDiNetPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` node in the PiDiNetPreprocessor controls the resolution at which the image should be processed, impacting the detail of soft-edge line extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does enabling the 'safe' mode for the PiDiNetPreprocessor do?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'safe' mode for the PiDiNetPreprocessor ensures that the preprocessing adheres to safety constraints, potentially affecting the output's fidelity and detail in favor of reducing risks during processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the PiDiNetPreprocessor generate?",
        "answer": "The PiDiNetPreprocessor generates a `image` output, which is the processed image with extracted soft-edge lines, ready for further analysis or processing in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of nodes are the PiDiNetPreprocessor node and the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node categorized under?",
        "answer": "Both the PiDiNetPreprocessor node and the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node are categorized under the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
