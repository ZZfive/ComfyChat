        "question": "What is the ttN_imageREMBG node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN_imageREMBG node in ComfyUI is designed to remove the background from images, using the REMBG library to abstract the complexity of background removal into a simple interface for easy integration into image processing pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ttN_imageREMBG node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ttN_imageREMBG node include `image` (the input image from which the background is to be removed), `image_output` (specifying the mode of output for the processed image), and `save_prefix` (a prefix for the filename when saving the processed image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the background removal process in the ttN_imageREMBG node?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the background removal process in the ttN_imageREMBG node is the `image`, which is the input image from which the background will be removed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different modes of output for the processed image in the ttN_imageREMBG node?",
        "answer": "The different modes of output for the processed image in the ttN_imageREMBG node include 'Hide', 'Preview', 'Save', and 'Hide/Save', allowing for flexible handling of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node would you use to save a processed image with a prefix from ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You would use the ttN_imageREMBG node to save a processed image with a prefix in ComfyUI, by setting the `save_prefix` input to the desired filename prefix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the ttN_imageREMBG node provide?",
        "answer": "The ttN_imageREMBG node provides two outputs: `image` (the processed image with the background removed) and `mask` (a mask indicating the areas of the image where the background was removed)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the computation type specified for the ttN_imageREMBG node?",
        "answer": "The computation type specified for the ttN_imageREMBG node is `CPU`, indicating that the background removal process is performed on the CPU infrastructure."
