        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleSplit node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSplit node is designed to divide a given schedule list into two parts based on a specified index, making it easier to manage or analyze smaller sections of schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltScheduleSplit node are `schedule_list`, which is a list of scheduled items to be split, and `split_index`, the index at which the schedule list is split."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of data does ComfyUI recognize for the `schedule_list` input in the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI recognizes `LIST` dtype for the `schedule_list` input in the SaltScheduleSplit node, which is Python's `List[Any]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality of the `split_index` input in the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The `split_index` input in the SaltScheduleSplit node determines the point in the list where the division occurs, affecting how the list is segmented into two parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs generated by the SaltScheduleSplit node?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSplit node generates two outputs: `schedule_list_a`, which is the first part of the list containing items before the split index, and `schedule_list_b`, which contains items from the split index onwards."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltScheduleSplit node handle invalid `split_index` values?",
        "answer": "If the `split_index` is greater than or equal to the length of the `schedule_list` or less than zero, the SaltScheduleSplit node raises a ValueError, indicating that the `split_index` must be within the range of the `schedule_list`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltScheduleSplit node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSplit node is classified under the category `SALT/Scheduling` within ComfyUI."
