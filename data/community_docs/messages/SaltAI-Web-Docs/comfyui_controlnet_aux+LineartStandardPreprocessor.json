        "question": "What is the purpose of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LineartStandardPreprocessor node is designed for extracting line art from images using a standard approach, making it suitable for applications requiring clear line delineation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the LineartStandardPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "LineartStandardPreprocessor belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the LineartStandardPreprocessor node produce?",
        "answer": "The LineartStandardPreprocessor node produces an image with enhanced and refined line art, suitable for further processing or direct use in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node influences the smoothness of the extracted lines?",
        "answer": "The 'guassian_sigma' input parameter of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node influences the smoothness of the extracted lines by specifying the sigma value for the Gaussian blur applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LineartStandardPreprocessor node determine the distinction between line art and the background?",
        "answer": "The LineartStandardPreprocessor node determines the distinction between line art and the background using the 'intensity_threshold' input parameter, which influences the threshold for intensity differentiation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'resolution' parameter on the output of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter affects the detail level of the extracted line art by resizing the input image to the specified resolution before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'guassian_sigma' input of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'guassian_sigma' input of the LineartStandardPreprocessor node is 6.0."
