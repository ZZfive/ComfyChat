        "question": "What is ImageDesaturate+?",
        "answer": "ImageDesaturate+ is a node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the saturation level of an image, effectively desaturating it to varying degrees based on a specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does ImageDesaturate+ belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageDesaturate+ belongs to the 'essentials' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image' parameter in ImageDesaturate+?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in ImageDesaturate+ represents the input image to be desaturated. It defines the visual content that will undergo the desaturation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' parameter control in ImageDesaturate+?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter in ImageDesaturate+ controls the degree of desaturation applied to the image, ranging from 0 (no change) to 1 (full grayscale)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output image of ImageDesaturate+ determined?",
        "answer": "The output of ImageDesaturate+ is the desaturated version of the input image, with its saturation level adjusted according to the specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is ImageDesaturate+ compatible with?",
        "answer": "ImageDesaturate+ is compatible with 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the 'factor' parameter in ImageDesaturate+?",
        "answer": "The default value of the 'factor' parameter in ImageDesaturate+ is 1.00, which corresponds to full desaturation to grayscale."
