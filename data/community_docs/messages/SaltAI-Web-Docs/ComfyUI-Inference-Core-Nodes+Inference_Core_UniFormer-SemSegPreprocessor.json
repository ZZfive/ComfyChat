        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is designed for semantic segmentation tasks, using the UniFormer model to process images and generate semantic segmentation maps. It simplifies model loading, image preprocessing, and inference into a single operation for efficient and accurate segmentation of images."

    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node belongs to the category 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor class?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor class has an input type 'image' which is required (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and an optional input 'resolution' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int) that specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node outputs the semantic segmentation map of the input image, represented as a 'IMAGE' tensor in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node has an infra type of 'GPU', indicating that it requires a GPU for efficient processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the resolution parameter used in the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution parameter in the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, affecting the granularity and quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function called in the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor source code for generating semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "The function 'semantic_segmentate' is called in the Inference_Core_UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor source code which processes the input image and generates the semantic segmentation output."
