        "question": "What is the SaltAudioInversion node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioInversion node in ComfyUI is designed to invert the waveform of an audio file, effectively flipping its phase. This process can create unique sound effects or serve audio testing purposes where phase inversion is necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the SaltAudioInversion node require?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioInversion node requires an audio file as input, specifically in the form of an AUDIO data type in ComfyUI, which represents an audio file as bytes in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioInversion node is an inverted audio file, where the phase of the original audio has been flipped. This output is also of the AUDIO data type, represented as bytes in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the functionality of the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The functionality of the SaltAudioInversion node is implemented by the `SaltAudioInversion` class in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a common usage scenario for the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "A common usage scenario for the SaltAudioInversion node is in audio production to create effects by flipping the phase of an audio file, or for audio testing where phase inversion is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioInversion node process the input audio?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioInversion node processes the input audio by inverting the phase of the waveform, essentially multiplying each sample of the audio file by -1 to create an inverted audio segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the SaltAudioInversion node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type required for the SaltAudioInversion node is CPU, indicating that the processing is done on the central processing unit."
