        "question": "What is LatentFlip?",
        "answer": "LatentFlip is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for manipulating latent representations by flipping them either vertically or horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does LatentFlip manipulate?",
        "answer": "LatentFlip manipulates latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentFlip transform data?",
        "answer": "LatentFlip transforms data in the latent space by flipping latent representations either vertically or horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of LatentFlip?",
        "answer": "The output of LatentFlip is a modified version of the input latent representations, flipped according to the specified method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for LatentFlip?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentFlip include 'samples', which are latent representations, and 'flip_method', specifying the axis along which the samples will be flipped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the flip_method parameter in LatentFlip?",
        "answer": "The flip_method parameter in LatentFlip specifies the axis (either 'x-axis: vertically' or 'y-axis: horizontally') along which the latent samples will be flipped, determining the direction of the flip."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of transformation does LatentFlip introduce?",
        "answer": "LatentFlip introduces transformations within the latent space, potentially uncovering new variations or perspectives within the data."
