        "question": "What is the Mikey Sampler node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler node is designed for sampling operations within the Mikey framework, focusing on generating or manipulating data samples, providing a streamlined interface for various sampling techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'base_model' parameter in the Mikey Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_model' parameter in the Mikey Sampler node specifies the primary model used for sampling, serving as the foundation for generating or refining samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Mikey Sampler node is used to refine the samples?",
        "answer": "The 'refiner_model' parameter is used to refine the samples generated by the base model, enhancing their quality or characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'samples' parameter play in the Mikey Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter represents the initial data samples that are to be processed or generated by the sampling operation in the Mikey Sampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'vae' parameter contribute to the sampling process in the Mikey Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter in the Mikey Sampler node specifies the variational autoencoder used in the sampling process, often for encoding or decoding operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'positive_cond_base' and 'negative_cond_base' parameters?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_cond_base' and 'negative_cond_base' parameters in the Mikey Sampler node define the positive and negative conditioning applied to the base model, guiding and steering the sampling towards or away from desired characteristics, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Mikey Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Mikey Sampler node is 'GPU' for optimal performance."
