        "question": "What is the VidDirIterator node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VidDirIterator node in ComfyUI is designed to navigate through directories containing video files, allowing for the retrieval of video file paths based on their index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'directory_path' input do in the VidDirIterator node?",
        "answer": "The 'directory_path' input specifies the path to the directory containing video files, which is crucial for the node to locate and list the video files for further operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'video_index' input used in the VidDirIterator node?",
        "answer": "The 'video_index' input determines the index of the video file to retrieve from the sorted list of video files in the directory, enabling targeted access to a specific video file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is associated with the 'directory_path' input in the VidDirIterator node?",
        "answer": "The 'directory_path' input in the VidDirIterator node is of the Comfy dtype 'STRING' and the Python dtype 'str', specifying the path to the directory containing video files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VidDirIterator node return?",
        "answer": "The VidDirIterator node returns the path to the video file at the specified index within the directory, facilitating direct access to the selected video file for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which video file formats are recognized by the VidDirIterator node?",
        "answer": "The VidDirIterator node recognizes video files with the extensions '.mov' and '.mp4' in the specified directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VidDirIterator node handle the 'video_index' if it exceeds the number of video files in the directory?",
        "answer": "The VidDirIterator node wraps the 'video_index' around using modulo, meaning that if the index exceeds the number of video files, it will cycle back to the beginning of the list."
