        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactIfNone node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactIfNone node in ComfyUI is designed to evaluate if a given input is None and conditionally execute logic based on that evaluation, serving as a decision-making node within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the flow of execution within the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The presence or absence of the 'signal' parameter determines the flow of execution within the ImpactIfNone node, influencing subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'any_input' parameter used for in the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The 'any_input' parameter in the ImpactIfNone node is required to accommodate any type of input, ensuring flexibility in the node's application across different scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'signal_opt' output represent in the ImpactIfNone node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal_opt' output either passes through the 'signal' value if it is not None, or it returns a fallback value, effectively allowing the node to conditionally substitute a value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bool' output of the ImpactIfNone node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'bool' output of the ImpactIfNone node indicates the result of the None check, providing a boolean value that represents whether the 'signal' was None or not."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes serve as a decision-making component in ComfyUI's workflow?",
        "answer": "The ImpactIfNone node serves as a decision-making component in ComfyUI's workflow by evaluating if a given input is None and conditionally executing logic based on that evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactIfNone node return if 'any_input' is not None?",
        "answer": "If 'any_input' is not None, the ImpactIfNone node returns the 'signal' and a boolean True, indicating that the input was present."
