        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSUpscaler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSUpscaler node is designed to upscale images by segmenting them into smaller sections, enhancing each segment individually, and then reassembling them into a single, enhanced image, allowing for more detailed and controlled upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SEGSUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SEGSUpscaler node is `SEGSUpscaler`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SEGSUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SEGSUpscaler node include `image`, `segs`, `model`, `clip`, `vae`, `rescale_factor`, `resampling_method`, `supersample`, `rounding_modulus`, `seed`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, `positive`, `negative`, `denoise`, `feather`, `inpaint_model`, and `noise_mask_feather`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which python data type does the 'image' input in SEGSUpscaler represent?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in SEGSUpscaler represents a `torch.Tensor` data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name that performs the upscaling in SEGSUpscaler?",
        "answer": "The function name that performs the upscaling in SEGSUpscaler is `doit`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' input in the SEGSUpscaler node refer to?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' input in the SEGSUpscaler node refers to a collection of image segments, each with its own characteristics and metadata, used for targeted upscaling and enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSUpscaler node reassemble an image after upscaling?",
        "answer": "The SEGSUpscaler node reassembles an image by combining all the processed segments into a single, high-quality output image."
