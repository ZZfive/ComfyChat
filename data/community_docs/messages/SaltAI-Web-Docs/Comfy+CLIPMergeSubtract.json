        "question": "What is CLIPMergeSubtract?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeSubtract is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for advanced model merging operations, specifically to subtract one CLIP model from another."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of CLIPMergeSubtract?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeSubtract belongs to the category 'advanced/model_merging'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CLIPMergeSubtract node do?",
        "answer": "The CLIPMergeSubtract node subtracts features or weights from one CLIP model (clip2) based on another CLIP model (clip1), adjusted by a multiplier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for CLIPMergeSubtract?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeSubtract requires 'clip1', 'clip2', and 'multiplier' as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the multiplier parameter affect CLIPMergeSubtract?",
        "answer": "The multiplier adjusts the scale of subtraction, fine-tuning how much features from 'clip2' are subtracted from 'clip1'. It ranges from -10.0 to 10.0 with a step of 0.01."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CLIPMergeSubtract?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeSubtract outputs a CLIP model ('clip') after subtracting features from 'clip1' based on 'clip2', adjusted by the multiplier."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CLIPMergeSubtract facilitate model customization?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeSubtract facilitates model customization by selectively subtracting features or weights from one CLIP model to create new, modified CLIP models."
