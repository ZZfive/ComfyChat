        "question": "What is the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node is designed to apply a set of masks to conditioning data, potentially modifying the conditioning area based on specified parameters, and then combine these conditioned elements into a single output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to alter the conditioning process by applying multiple masks with varying strengths and areas?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node can be used to alter the conditioning process by applying multiple masks with varying strengths and areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the `positive_i` input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the `positive_i` input in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node is `CONDITIONING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node treat the negative conditioning elements?",
        "answer": "The ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node specifies a set of negative conditioning elements to be masked and combined, similar to positive inputs. The mask's strength and area settings influence the conditioning outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mask_i_strength` parameter in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node control?",
        "answer": "The `mask_i_strength` parameter defines the strength of the mask applied to the conditioning elements, affecting the intensity of the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `set_cond_area` parameter in the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node control?",
        "answer": "The `set_cond_area` parameter determines whether to set the conditioning area to the bounds of the mask or use a default setting, influencing how the mask is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine3 node includes `combined_positive` and `combined_negative`, the combined results of positive and negative conditioning elements after mask application and processing."
