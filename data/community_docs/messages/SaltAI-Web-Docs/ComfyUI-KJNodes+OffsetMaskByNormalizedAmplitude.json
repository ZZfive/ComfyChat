        "question": "What is the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node in ComfyUI is used to apply transformations to a mask based on the normalized amplitude of an audio signal, adjusting the mask's orientation and position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mask` input represent in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node represents a visual element whose modifications are driven by audio amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `normalized_amp` input affect the transformation in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The `normalized_amp` input, an array of normalized amplitude values from an audio signal, determines the extent of transformation in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude dictates the mask's horizontal movement?",
        "answer": "The `x` input in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node dictates the mask's horizontal movement in response to amplitude changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `angle_multiplier` play in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The `angle_multiplier` in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node is a multiplier for the rotation angle, scaling the effect of the normalized amplitude on the mask's rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `rotate` input parameter do in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node?",
        "answer": "The `rotate` input parameter in the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node is a boolean indicating whether the mask should be rotated based on the normalized amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node produce?",
        "answer": "The OffsetMaskByNormalizedAmplitude node produces a `mask` output after applying rotation and shift adjustments based on the audio's normalized amplitude."
