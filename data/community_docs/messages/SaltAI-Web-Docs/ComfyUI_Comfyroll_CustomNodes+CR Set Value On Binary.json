        "question": "What is the CR Set Value On Binary node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Set Value On Binary node is designed to conditionally assign a value based on a binary input, facilitating decision-making processes within a workflow by allowing users to specify different outcomes depending on whether the binary input is 1 or 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the 'binary' input is 1 or 0 in the CR Set Value On Binary node?",
        "answer": "When the 'binary' input is 1, the CR Set Value On Binary node returns the 'value_if_1'; if the 'binary' input is 0, it returns the 'value_if_0'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value_if_1' input do in the CR Set Value On Binary node?",
        "answer": "The 'value_if_1' input in the CR Set Value On Binary node specifies the value to return if the binary input is 1, enabling conditional logic based on binary input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the outcome in the CR Set Value On Binary node?",
        "answer": "The 'binary' input determines the outcome in the CR Set Value On Binary node; if 1, 'value_if_1' is returned; if 0, 'value_if_0' is returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the CR Set Value On Binary node have?",
        "answer": "The CR Set Value On Binary node outputs an integer ('INT'), a floating-point ('FLOAT'), and a string ('show_help'). The integer and floating-point outputs represent the selected value based on the binary input, and the string output is a URL to the help documentation for the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the decision between 'value_if_1' and 'value_if_0' made in the CR Set Value On Binary node?",
        "answer": "The decision between 'value_if_1' and 'value_if_0' in the CR Set Value On Binary node is made based on the binary input: if the input is 1, 'value_if_1' is selected; if 0, 'value_if_0' is selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'show_help' output in the CR Set Value On Binary node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR Set Value On Binary node is a URL to the help documentation for the node, providing users with a link to additional information and support."
