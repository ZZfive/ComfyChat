        "question": "What is the Range(Num Steps) - Int node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI is used to generate a range of integer values based on specified start and stop points, a number of steps, and an end mode, allowing for evenly or unevenly spaced sequences of integers."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI generates sequences of integers based on a start and stop point and the number of steps?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node generates sequences of integers based on a start and stop point, the number of steps, and end mode in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI belongs to the 'List Stuff' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' input represent in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the Range(Num Steps) - Int node of ComfyUI, the 'start' input defines the starting point of the range from which the integer sequence generation begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Range(Num Steps) - Int node determine whether to include the 'stop' value in the generated range?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI determines whether to include the 'stop' value based on the 'end_mode' input, which can be set to 'Inclusive' or 'Exclusive' to include or exclude the stop value, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'range' output represent in the Range(Num Steps) - Int node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the Range(Num Steps) - Int node of ComfyUI, the 'range' output represents the generated sequence of integers within the specified range, which has a Comfy dtype of 'INT' and a Python dtype of 'List[int]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'range_sizes' output of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node indicate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'range_sizes' output of the Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI indicates the size of each generated range, which is the number of integers in each sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under what conditions does the Range(Num Steps) - Int node throw an error regarding uneven steps?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Int node in ComfyUI throws an error regarding uneven steps when the 'allow_uneven_steps' input is set to 'False', and the difference between the 'start' and 'stop' points divided by the 'num_steps' is not an integer."
