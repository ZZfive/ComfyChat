        "question": "What is ImageDrawPolygon?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawPolygon is a class in ComfyUI designed for drawing regular polygons on an image canvas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ImageDrawPolygon?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageDrawPolygon include size, sides, rotation, outline size, outline color components (red, green, blue, alpha), fill color components (red, green, blue, alpha), supersampling anti-aliasing factor (SSAA), and method for resizing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageDrawPolygon handle rotation?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawPolygon handles rotation by allowing users to set the rotation angle of the polygon in degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SSAA parameter in ImageDrawPolygon?",
        "answer": "The SSAA parameter in ImageDrawPolygon sets the supersampling anti-aliasing factor, which enhances the quality of rendering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fill_alpha parameter control in ImageDrawPolygon?",
        "answer": "The fill_alpha parameter in ImageDrawPolygon controls the alpha transparency of the fill color, enabling semi-transparent effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the method parameter used for in ImageDrawPolygon?",
        "answer": "The method parameter in ImageDrawPolygon selects the method for resizing the image after drawing the polygon, influencing the final image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageDrawPolygon ensure high-quality rendering?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawPolygon ensures high-quality rendering through supersampling (SSAA) and supports different resizing methods."
