        "question": "What is the SaltAudioMixer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioMixer is a node designed to blend two audio inputs into a single output by overlaying one audio segment onto another at a specified mix time, essential for creating composite audio tracks from multiple sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SaltAudioMixer node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SaltAudioMixer node is `SaltAudioMixer`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does SaltAudioMixer belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioMixer belongs to the `SALT/Audio/Process` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the SaltAudioMixer node require to serve as the base layer?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioMixer node requires `audio_a` as the first audio input, which serves as the base layer onto which the second audio input will be overlaid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `mix_time_seconds` input in SaltAudioMixer?",
        "answer": "The `mix_time_seconds` input in SaltAudioMixer specifies the time offset in seconds at which the second audio input (`audio_b`) will be overlaid onto the first (`audio_a`), providing precise control over the timing of the audio mix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioMixer node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioMixer node is `mixed_audio`, which is the resulting audio after mixing the two inputs. It is a single audio track that combines elements of both input tracks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the SaltAudioMixer node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the SaltAudioMixer node is `CPU`."
