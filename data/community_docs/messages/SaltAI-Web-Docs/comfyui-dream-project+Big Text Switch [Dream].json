        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Big Text Switch [Dream] node dynamically selects one of several text inputs based on a specified condition, facilitating conditional logic within a flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The required input types include `select`, which specifies the index of the text input to be selected, and `on_missing`, which defines the fallback behavior when the selected text input does not meet the condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `select` input in the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The `select` input determines which text input is chosen based on the condition provided, playing a crucial role in the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Big Text Switch [Dream] handle missing text inputs?",
        "answer": "The Big Text Switch [Dream] node handles missing text inputs through the `on_missing` parameter, which allows for a fallback mechanism to either the previous or next valid input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output `selected` represent in the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The `selected` output represents the text value chosen based on the specified condition and inputs, serving as the outcome of the conditional logic applied by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The category of the Big Text Switch [Dream] node is `âœ¨ Dream/ðŸ›  utils/â­† switches`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the Big Text Switch [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The infra type recommended for the Big Text Switch [Dream] node is `CPU`."
