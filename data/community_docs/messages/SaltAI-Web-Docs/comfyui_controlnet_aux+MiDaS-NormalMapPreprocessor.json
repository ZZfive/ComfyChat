        "question": "What is the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node is used for generating normal maps from images in ComfyUI. It utilizes the MiDaS model to preprocess images for enhanced depth estimation, aiding in the creation of detailed normal maps suitable for applications like 3D modeling and augmented reality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node responsible for?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node serves as the input image for which the normal map will be generated. It is the basis for depth estimation and normal map creation, and its data type is `numpy.ndarray` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the intensity of depth estimation be adjusted in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The intensity of depth estimation can be adjusted using the 'a' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor. This parameter influences the contrast and detail in the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'bg_threshold' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'bg_threshold' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node sets the threshold for background separation, helping to isolate the subject from the background during the depth estimation process. Its data type is a floating point number (`float` in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' parameter affect the output of the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the depth estimation and normal map generation are performed. This setting affects the detail level of the output normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node output and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node outputs an image representing the normal map generated from the input image. The output data type is `IMAGE` in ComfyUI, corresponding to `numpy.ndarray` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for utilizing the MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The MiDaS-NormalMapPreprocessor node is recommended to be used on GPU infrastructure for optimal performance."
