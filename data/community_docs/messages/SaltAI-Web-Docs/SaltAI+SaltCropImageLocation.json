        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltCropImageLocation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltCropImageLocation node in ComfyUI is designed to crop images based on specified locations, allowing for precise adjustments and modifications to image datasets."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SaltCropImageLocation node belong to in the SALT/Image/Process category?",
        "answer": "The SaltCropImageLocation node belongs to the 'SALT/Image/Process' category in ComfyUI, specifically under class name `SaltCropImageLocation`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' input of the SaltCropImageLocation node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input of the SaltCropImageLocation node is the collection of images to be cropped. It is the central parameter that determines which images undergo cropping based on provided dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'top' input in the SaltCropImageLocation node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'top' input in the SaltCropImageLocation node specifies the top boundary of the crop area. Adjusting this value alters the vertical starting point of the crop, enabling fine-tuned control over the cropped region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'crop_data_batch' input in the SaltCropImageLocation node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_data_batch' input in the SaltCropImageLocation node is an optional batch of crop data used to specify multiple crop regions for a set of images, enabling batch processing with varying crop specifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is returned by the 'crop_data_batch' output of the SaltCropImageLocation node?",
        "answer": "The 'crop_data_batch' output of the SaltCropImageLocation node provides detailed information about the crop regions applied to each image in the form of a list of tuples, with each tuple containing four integers representing the top, left, right, and bottom boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the cropped image data represented in the 'images' output of the SaltCropImageLocation node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' output of the SaltCropImageLocation node represents the resulting images after the cropping operation as a list of PIL images, suitable for further processing or analysis."
