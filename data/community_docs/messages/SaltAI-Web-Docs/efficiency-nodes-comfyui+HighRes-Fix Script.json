        "question": "What is the HighRes-Fix Script node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HighRes-Fix Script node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image resolution and quality in a customizable manner, leveraging various upscaling techniques, control nets, and preprocessing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the method of upscaling used by the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The `upscale_type` input determines the method of upscaling used by the HighRes-Fix Script node, affecting the quality and approach of the high-resolution output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `hires_ckpt_name` input specify in the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The `hires_ckpt_name` input in the HighRes-Fix Script node specifies the checkpoint name for the high-resolution model, indicating the specific model version or configuration to use for upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `latent_upscaler` input play in the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "The `latent_upscaler` input in the HighRes-Fix Script node identifies the latent space upscaling method, which enhances image detail at a foundational level before pixel-level adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the scaling factor for the upscaling process determined?",
        "answer": "The scaling factor for the upscaling process is determined by the `upscale_by` input, which directly influences the final image size and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does setting `use_same_seed` to true have in the HighRes-Fix Script node?",
        "answer": "Setting `use_same_seed` to true in the HighRes-Fix Script node controls whether the same seed is used throughout the upscaling process, ensuring consistency in random elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way does the `control_net_name` input influence the upscaling process?",
        "answer": "The `control_net_name` input in the HighRes-Fix Script node influences the upscaling process by specifying the control net to be used for guided upscaling, directing the quality and direction of enhancements."
