        "question": "What is the purpose of WAV Curve [Dream] in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "WAV Curve [Dream] dynamically generates animation curves based on the amplitude of audio data from a WAV file, allowing animations to synchronize with audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the frame_counter input do in WAV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The frame_counter input determines the current point in the animation timeline, affecting which part of the WAV file's amplitude is used to generate the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does WAV Curve [Dream] scale the amplitude value?",
        "answer": "WAV Curve [Dream] scales the amplitude value extracted from the WAV file using the scale input, which adjusts the intensity of the animation curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of WAV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "WAV Curve [Dream] outputs both FLOAT and INT types. FLOAT provides the scaled amplitude value as a floating-point number, while INT rounds the scaled value to the nearest integer for discrete animation steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ComfyUI dtype for the wav_path input in WAV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The ComfyUI dtype for the wav_path input in WAV Curve [Dream] is STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does WAV Curve [Dream] utilize?",
        "answer": "WAV Curve [Dream] utilizes the CPU for its infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is used for the scale input in WAV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype used for the scale input in WAV Curve [Dream] is float."
