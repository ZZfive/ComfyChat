        "question": "What is SeedSelector?",
        "answer": "SeedSelector is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for procedural generation tasks, allowing users to select seed values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does SeedSelector belong to?",
        "answer": "SeedSelector belongs to the 'Art Venture/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SeedSelector output?",
        "answer": "SeedSelector outputs a selected seed value, which can be either fixed or randomly determined based on the mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for SeedSelector?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for SeedSelector are 'mode', 'seed', and 'fixed_seed'. 'mode' determines whether the seed selection is random or fixed, 'seed' is the seed value used in random mode, and 'fixed_seed' is the seed used in fixed mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SeedSelector ensure reproducibility?",
        "answer": "SeedSelector ensures reproducibility by allowing users to set a fixed seed value ('fixed_seed'), which guarantees consistent results across runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of procedural generation tasks is SeedSelector suitable for?",
        "answer": "SeedSelector is suitable for procedural generation tasks that require switching between random and fixed seed modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of SeedSelector's 'mode' input?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in SeedSelector determines whether the seed selection is random or fixed, influencing the variability of generated outcomes."
