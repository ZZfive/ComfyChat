        "question": "What is the DF_Tangent node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Tangent node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the tangent or arctangent of a given value, with the option to specify the angle measurement unit as degrees or radians."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DF_Tangent node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Tangent node belongs to the Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name associated with the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the DF_Tangent node is `DF_Tangent`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the angle measurement unit in the DF_Tangent node?",
        "answer": "The input that determines the angle measurement unit in the DF_Tangent node is `type_`, which accepts values of RAD for radians or DEG for degrees."
