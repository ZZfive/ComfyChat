        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Noise Injection node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Noise Injection node in ComfyUI is designed to augment latent representations with stochastic noise, which can introduce variability and potentially enhance the generative qualities of models by injecting controlled noise into the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific parameter controls the intensity of the noise added by the Latent Noise Injection node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_std' parameter controls the standard deviation of the noise to be injected, allowing for fine-tuning of the noise intensity for different effects on the latent samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Latent Noise Injection node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Noise Injection node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Latent/Generate' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'noise_std' parameter affect the output of the Latent Noise Injection node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_std' parameter affects the output of the Latent Noise Injection node by controlling the scale of the noise added to the latent representations. A higher value will result in more pronounced noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Latent Noise Injection node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Noise Injection node requires two types of inputs: the 'samples' parameter, which represents the latent representations to which noise will be added, and the 'noise_std' parameter that controls the standard deviation of the noise to be injected."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the Latent Noise Injection node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes in conjunction with the Latent Noise Injection node include the 'KSampler' and 'Reroute' nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Latent Noise Injection node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the Latent Noise Injection node is a modified version of the input latent samples, which are now augmented with noise according to the specified standard deviation."
