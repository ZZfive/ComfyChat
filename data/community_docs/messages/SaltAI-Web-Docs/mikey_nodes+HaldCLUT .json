        "question": "What is the class name of the node that applies a color lookup table to an image?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that applies a color lookup table to an image is `HaldCLUT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the HaldCLUT node belong to?",
        "answer": "The HaldCLUT node belongs to the `Mikey/Image` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the HaldCLUT node?",
        "answer": "The HaldCLUT node is used to apply a color lookup table (CLUT) to an image, achieving various color grading effects with optional gamma correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'image' input of the HaldCLUT node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input of the HaldCLUT node expects data of type `IMAGE` as its Comfy dtype, which corresponds to `PIL.Image` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the specific color grading effect applied by the HaldCLUT node?",
        "answer": "The specific color grading effect applied by the HaldCLUT node is determined by the selected HaldCLUT file specified by the 'hald_clut' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the HaldCLUT node perform gamma correction by default?",
        "answer": "The HaldCLUT node does not perform gamma correction by default; it is controlled by the 'gamma_correction' input, which is a boolean flag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the HaldCLUT node output?",
        "answer": "The HaldCLUT node outputs an image of type 'IMAGE', represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python, after applying the color lookup table and optional gamma correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of files are read by the HaldCLUT node for color transformation?",
        "answer": "The HaldCLUT node reads HaldCLUT files for color transformation, which are selected from a list of available files stored in `s.haldclut_files`."
