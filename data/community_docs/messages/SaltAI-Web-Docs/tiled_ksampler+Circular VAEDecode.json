        "question": "What is the purpose of the Circular VAEDecode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Circular VAEDecode node in ComfyUI is designed for decoding latent representations into images, specifically by modifying the padding mode of convolutional layers in the VAE's first stage model to 'circular'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Circular' in the name of the Circular VAEDecode node refer to?",
        "answer": "'Circular' in the name of the Circular VAEDecode node refers to the circular padding mode of convolutional layers in the VAE's first stage model, which enhances the decoding process by providing seamless transitions in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Circular VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Circular VAEDecode node are 'samples' (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) and 'vae' (Comfy dtype: VAE, Python dtype: torch.nn.Module)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' input in the Circular VAEDecode node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' input in the Circular VAEDecode node represents the latent representation to be decoded into an image, containing the encoded information of the image to be reconstructed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae' input in the Circular VAEDecode node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' input in the Circular VAEDecode node specifies the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model used for the decoding process, which contains the architecture and parameters necessary for transforming the latent representation back into an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Circular VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Circular VAEDecode node is 'image', with a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and Python dtype of Tuple[torch.Tensor], representing the decoded image generated from the latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is suitable for the Circular VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The suitable infrastructure type for the Circular VAEDecode node is GPU."
