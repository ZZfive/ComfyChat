        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltOPACPerlinSettings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltOPACPerlinSettings node is designed to configure Perlin noise sampling parameters for the OPAC node in ComfyUI, enabling dynamic visual effects based on noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types accepted by the SaltOPACPerlinSettings node?",
        "answer": "The SaltOPACPerlinSettings node accepts various input types including `zoom_octaves`, `zoom_persistence`, `zoom_lacunarity`, `zoom_repeat`, `angle_octaves`, `angle_persistence`, `angle_lacunarity`, etc., for configuring Perlin noise parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the number of Perlin noise layers applied and how does it affect the visual effect?",
        "answer": "The `zoom_octaves` input controls the number of layers of Perlin noise to apply. This influences the complexity of the visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `zoom_persistence` input influence the visual effects in SaltOPACPerlinSettings?",
        "answer": "The `zoom_persistence` input affects the amplitude of each octave in the Perlin noise, adjusting the visual's contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `angle_lacunarity` in the SaltOPACPerlinSettings node?",
        "answer": "The `angle_lacunarity` input influences the frequency of each octave for angle Perlin noise, changing the rotation texture."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type sets the repetition rate of the X-axis translation Perlin noise pattern and how does it impact the movement?",
        "answer": "The `trx_repeat` input determines the repetition rate of the X-axis translation Perlin noise pattern, affecting the movement's periodicity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltOPACPerlinSettings node output and what is its purpose?",
        "answer": "The SaltOPACPerlinSettings node outputs the `opac_perlin_settings` parameter, which is a dictionary containing the configured Perlin noise parameters, ready to be applied to the OPAC node for generating dynamic visual effects."
