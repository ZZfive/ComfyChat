        "question": "What is the SaltMaskGaussianRegion class in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGaussianRegion class in ComfyUI is a custom node used to apply a Gaussian filter to specified regions within masks, softening edges and blending regions for a smoother appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGaussianRegion node requires `masks` as the masks to which the Gaussian filter will be applied, and `radius` which specifies the radius of the Gaussian filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the masks input in the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node?",
        "answer": "The `masks` input in the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node defines the regions that will be processed with a Gaussian filter to achieve a smoother appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the radius of the Gaussian filter specified in the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node?",
        "answer": "The radius of the Gaussian filter is specified by the `radius` input in the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskGaussianRegion node produces modified masks as output after the application of the Gaussian filter, showcasing smoother and more blended regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the modified mask representation handled in the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node after the Gaussian filtering process?",
        "answer": "After applying the Gaussian filter, the SaltMaskGaussianRegion node returns the modified masks as `List[torch.Tensor]`, showcasing smoother and more blended regions."
