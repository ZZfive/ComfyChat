        "question": "In ComfyUI, what is the purpose of the IpaConfiguration node?",
        "answer": "The IpaConfiguration node in ComfyUI is designed to configure advanced image processing adjustments (IPA) settings for steerable motion in image generation, focusing on parameters like start and end points, weight, scaling, and noise characteristics to enhance the visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ipa_starts_at` parameter specify in the IpaConfiguration node?",
        "answer": "The `ipa_starts_at` parameter specifies the starting point of the IPA effect, influencing when the adjustments begin to take effect in the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of `ipa_starts_at` and `ipa_ends_at` in Python?",
        "answer": "The data types of `ipa_starts_at` and `ipa_ends_at` in Python are `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the IpaConfiguration node use an image as the source for noise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the IpaConfiguration node in ComfyUI can use an image as the source for noise if the `use_image_for_noise` parameter is set to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `type_of_noise` parameter in IpaConfiguration control?",
        "answer": "The `type_of_noise` parameter in IpaConfiguration controls the type of noise, such as 'fade', affecting the visual characteristics of the noise applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What range of values can the `noise_blur` parameter take in the IpaConfiguration node?",
        "answer": "The `noise_blur` parameter in the IpaConfiguration node can take values from 0 to 32, inclusive, controlling the level of blur applied to the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `configuration` output from the IpaConfiguration node represent?",
        "answer": "The `configuration` output from the IpaConfiguration node represents the configured advanced IPA settings, encapsulating all specified adjustments for steerable motion in image generation in the form of a dictionary."
