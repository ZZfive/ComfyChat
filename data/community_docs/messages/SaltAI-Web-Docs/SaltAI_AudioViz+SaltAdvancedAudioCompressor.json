    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the threshold_dB input in the SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the threshold_dB input in the SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor node is -20.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor is responsible for determining the start of the compression effect?",
        "answer": "The threshold_dB parameter in SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor is responsible for determining the start of the compression effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the makeup_gain parameter in the SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor node adjust?",
        "answer": "The makeup_gain parameter in the SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor node adjusts the makeup gain in decibels (dB), applied after compression to restore or increase the overall level of the audio signal."
