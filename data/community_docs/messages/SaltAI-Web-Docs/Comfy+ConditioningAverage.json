        "question": "What is ConditioningAverage?",
        "answer": "ConditioningAverage is a node in ComfyUI designed for blending conditioning vectors from two sources by averaging them, with adjustable strength settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ConditioningAverage belong to?",
        "answer": "ConditioningAverage belongs to the 'conditioning' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main purpose of ConditioningAverage?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of ConditioningAverage is to blend conditioning vectors from two sources by averaging them, allowing for balanced integration of conditioning information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ConditioningAverage?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ConditioningAverage include 'conditioning_to', 'conditioning_from', and 'conditioning_to_strength'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conditioning_to' input represent?",
        "answer": "'conditioning_to' represents the target conditioning vectors to which the blending will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ConditioningAverage handle multiple entries in 'conditioning_from'?",
        "answer": "ConditioningAverage issues a warning when 'conditioning_from' contains more than one conditioning vector; only the first vector is applied to 'conditioning_to'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ConditioningAverage?",
        "answer": "The output type of ConditioningAverage is a modified list of conditioning vectors, reflecting the averaged blend of the input sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method does ConditioningAverage use for blending?",
        "answer": "ConditioningAverage uses the 'addWeighted' method for blending conditioning vectors."
