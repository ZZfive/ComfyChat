        "question": "What is the class name for the node that combines multiple images into a single batch in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that combines multiple images into a single batch is `ImageBatchMulti`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImageBatchMulti node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchMulti node belongs to the `KJNodes/image` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "The ImageBatchMulti node facilitates the creation of a batch of images by combining multiple input images into a single batch, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the number of input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter determines the number of images to be included in the batch in the ImageBatchMulti node?",
        "answer": "The parameter `inputcount` specifies the number of images to be included in the batch, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the `image_i` input represent in the ImageBatchMulti node?",
        "answer": "The `image_i` input represents any image to be included in the batch, starting from 'image_1' to 'image_{inputcount}', and it is of Comfy dtype `IMAGE`, which corresponds to the Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageBatchMulti node and how is it generated?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageBatchMulti node is `images`, which is a torch.Tensor resulting from the combined batch of images generated by aggregating individual input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for using the ImageBatchMulti node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageBatchMulti` node has an infra type of `GPU`, suggesting that it requires a Graphics Processing Unit for its processing capabilities."
