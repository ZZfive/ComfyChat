        "question": "What is the SaltImageComposite node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltImageComposite node in ComfyUI is used for creating complex image compositions by blending or layering multiple images according to specified schedules, enabling the dynamic combination of images to create visually rich and varied outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltImageComposite node include 'images_a', 'images_b', and 'mode'. 'images_a' and 'images_b' are the sets of images to be blended, and 'mode' defines the method of blending."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input parameter control in the SaltImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input parameter in the SaltImageComposite node controls the blending method, specifying how 'images_a' and 'images_b' are combined, and influences the visual outcome of the composite."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input allows for controlled blending in the SaltImageComposite node by specifying affected areas?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' optional input in the SaltImageComposite node allows for more controlled blending by specifying areas of the images to be affected or protected during the compositing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SaltImageComposite node generate, and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The SaltImageComposite node generates the output 'images', which represents the resulting images after applying the compositing operations. These final composites blend all input images according to the defined modes and schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'blend_schedule' input in the SaltImageComposite node?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_schedule' input in the SaltImageComposite node serves to dictate the blending intensity or method over time, allowing for dynamic changes in the compositing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltImageComposite node handle the blending process when 'masks' are provided as input?",
        "answer": "When 'masks' are provided as input to the SaltImageComposite node, it applies the masks to selectively blend areas of the images, specifying which parts of the images should be affected or protected during the compositing process."
