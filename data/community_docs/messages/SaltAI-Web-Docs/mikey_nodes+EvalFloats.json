        "question": "What is the purpose of the EvalFloats node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EvalFloats node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically evaluate mathematical expressions. It takes two float inputs and a formula as a string, then returns the result of processing the formula."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of data can the EvalFloats node process?",
        "answer": "EvalFloats node processes float and string data types. The two float inputs are denoted as 'a' and 'b', and the string input represents a mathematical formula."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' input represent in the EvalFloats node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in the EvalFloats node represents the first float input for the mathematical formula. Its value is crucial as it directly influences the outcome of the evaluated expression."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the EvalFloats node handle the formula input?",
        "answer": "The formula input in EvalFloats node is a string that includes placeholders for 'a' and 'b'. During processing, these variables are replaced by their respective input values to evaluate the expression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the EvalFloats node?",
        "answer": "The EvalFloats node outputs the result of the evaluated formula in multiple formats: a floating-point number ('result_float'), an integer ('result_int'), and a string ('result_str')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the usage tip for the EvalFloats node?",
        "answer": "The usage tip for the EvalFloats node includes specifying the infra type as 'CPU'. It is used for processing mathematical formulas within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the EvalFloats node return in Python dtype?",
        "answer": "In Python dtype, the EvalFloats node returns the result of the evaluated formula as a float. This is consistent with its Comfy dtype output of 'FLOAT'."
