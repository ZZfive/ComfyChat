        "question": "What is the KMeansColor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node in ComfyUI is used to apply the K-means clustering algorithm to an image, simplifying its color palette to a specified number of colors, which is useful for color quantization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the KMeansColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node falls under the category `Bmad/CV/Color A.` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node requires the `image`, `number_of_colors`, `max_iterations`, and `eps` parameters as inputs to perform color quantization on an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter determines the final number of colors in the image after processing with the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The `number_of_colors` parameter in the KMeansColor node determines the final number of colors in the image after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the KMeansColor node affect the input image?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node processes the input image using the K-means clustering algorithm to simplify its color palette according to the specified parameters, resulting in an image with a reduced number of colors but preserved essential visual characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node generates an output of type `IMAGE`, which is the processed image with a simplified color palette."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of device is recommended for running the KMeansColor node?",
        "answer": "The KMeansColor node is recommended to be run on a GPU for optimal performance."
