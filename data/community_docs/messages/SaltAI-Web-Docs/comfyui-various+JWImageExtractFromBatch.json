        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageExtractFromBatch node is used to extract a single image from a batch of images based on the specified index, enabling individual image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageExtractFromBatch node are `images` (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and `index` (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the JWImageExtractFromBatch node determine which image to extract from the batch?",
        "answer": "The JWImageExtractFromBatch node determines which image to extract from the batch based on the `index` input, which specifies the position of the image within the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWImageExtractFromBatch node is a single image extracted from the specified index of the input batch, with the Comfy dtype: IMAGE and Python dtype: torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of hardware can the JWImageExtractFromBatch node be efficiently run?",
        "answer": "The JWImageExtractFromBatch node can be efficiently run on GPU hardware, as indicated by the infra type: GPU."
