    {
        "question": "What category does ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine belong to?",
        "answer": "ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine belongs to the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/single cond ops' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine specialize in?",
        "answer": "ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine specializes in the application and combination of masks and additional conditioning layers for precise control over generative model outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine modify conditioning data?",
        "answer": "ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine modifies conditioning data by enhancing it with additional conditioning layers and masks, adjusting their strength and targeting specific areas within the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine include 'cond' (CONDITIONING), 'cond_ADD' (CONDITIONING), 'strength' (FLOAT), and 'set_cond_area' (COMBO[STRING])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' input control in ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input in ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine controls the intensity of mask application on conditioning data, determining how strongly additional conditioning and masks affect the original data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine?",
        "answer": "The output type of ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine is 'conditioning' (CONDITIONING), which represents the enhanced or modified conditioning data after applying additional layers and masks."
