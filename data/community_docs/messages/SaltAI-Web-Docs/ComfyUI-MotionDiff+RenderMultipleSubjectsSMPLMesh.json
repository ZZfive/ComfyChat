    {
        "question": "What does the `smpl_multi_subjects` input represent in the RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node?",
        "answer": "The `smpl_multi_subjects` input contains the SMPL models of multiple subjects, including their mesh data and motion information."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs control the camera's movement in the RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node?",
        "answer": "The camera's movement is controlled by the `move_x`, `move_y`, and `move_z` inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `depth_only` input in the RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node?",
        "answer": "The `depth_only` input determines whether only the depth map of the scene is rendered, which can be useful for visual analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the rendered scene's perspective be adjusted in terms of camera focal point in the RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node?",
        "answer": "The rendered scene's perspective can be adjusted using the `fx_offset` and `fy_offset` inputs, which control the horizontal and vertical offset for the camera's focal point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node provide to show the spatial relationships and distances between subjects?",
        "answer": "The RenderMultipleSubjectsSMPLMesh node provides a `DEPTH_MAP` output, which is a visual representation of the depth of the rendered scene."
