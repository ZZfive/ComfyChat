        "question": "What is the PixelKSampleHookCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PixelKSampleHookCombine is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to combine two PixelKSampleHook instances into a single hook, enabling the sequential application of their functionalities in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the PixelKSampleHookCombine node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PixelKSampleHookCombine node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Upscale' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PixelKSampleHookCombine node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PixelKSampleHookCombine node are 'hook1' and 'hook2', both of type 'PK_HOOK', representing the two PixelKSampleHook instances to be combined."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PixelKSampleHookCombine node work?",
        "answer": "The PixelKSampleHookCombine node works by chaining together two PixelKSampleHook instances, allowing for the sequential application of their functionalities in image processing tasks. This is achieved by passing the output of the first hook (hook1) as the input to the second hook (hook2)."

    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the PixelKSampleHookCombine node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the PixelKSampleHookCombine node is 'PK_HOOK', which represents the combined PixelKSampleHook instance capable of executing the functionalities of both input hooks in sequence during image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python class can be used to instantiate the PixelKSampleHookCombine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PixelKSampleHookCombine node in ComfyUI can be instantiated using the Python class named 'PixelKSampleHookCombine'. This class has a method 'doit' which combines 'hook1' and 'hook2' into a single 'pk_hook'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of combining PixelKSampleHook instances using the PixelKSampleHookCombine node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of combining PixelKSampleHook instances using the PixelKSampleHookCombine node is to sequentially apply their functionalities, thus extending or modifying the behavior of image processing pipelines by chaining multiple hooks together."
