    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters are required for the VHS_LoadImagesPath node and what do they do?",
        "answer": "The required parameter for the VHS_LoadImagesPath node is `directory`, which specifies the directory from which images are to be loaded, determining the source of the images to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the optional parameters for the VHS_LoadImagesPath node and how do they affect image loading?",
        "answer": "The optional parameters for the VHS_LoadImagesPath node are `image_load_cap`, `skip_first_images`, and `select_every_nth`. `image_load_cap` limits the number of images loaded, `skip_first_images` skips a specified number of images at the beginning of the directory, and `select_every_nth` loads every nth image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the VHS_LoadImagesPath node provide?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadImagesPath node outputs `image`, `mask`, and `int` types. `image` is for the loaded images ready for further processing, `mask` provides generated masks for image editing, and `int` gives the total count of images loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used together with the VHS_LoadImagesPath node in a ComfyUI workflow?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used together with the VHS_LoadImagesPath node include `ImpactImageBatchToImageList`, `PreviewImage`, `IPAdapterEncoder`, and `LinearBatchCreativeInterpolation`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of image loading, what role does the parameter `select_every_nth` play in the VHS_LoadImagesPath node?",
        "answer": "The parameter `select_every_nth` in the VHS_LoadImagesPath node loads every nth image from the directory, providing a method to thin out the image set for processing, thus allowing for selective loading based on frequency."
