        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToStringList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToStringList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple string inputs into a single list, facilitating operations that require collective handling of strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ToStringList node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToStringList node belongs to the 'Bmad/Lists/Make or Intercalate' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ToStringList node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ToStringList node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter that determines the size of the list in the ToStringList node?",
        "answer": "The input parameter that determines the size of the list in the ToStringList node is `inputs_len`. This specifies the number of string inputs to be aggregated into the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the 'inputs_len' parameter of the ToStringList node use in Comfy?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter uses the 'INT' data type in Comfy, and the Python data type is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ToStringList node consist of?",
        "answer": "The output of the ToStringList node is a list composed of the aggregated string inputs. This list enables further processing or manipulation as a collective entity and uses the 'STRING' data type in Comfy with the Python data type 'List[str]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is the ToStringList node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The ToStringList node is optimized for CPU infrastructure."
