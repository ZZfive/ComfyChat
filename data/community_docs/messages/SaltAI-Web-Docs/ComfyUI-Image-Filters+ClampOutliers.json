        "question": "What is the ClampOutliers node in ComfyUI designed for?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the values of latent representations by clamping outliers based on a specified standard deviation threshold, aiming to normalize the data and reduce the impact of extreme values on the overall distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ClampOutliers use to determine which data points are considered outliers?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node uses the 'latents' parameter, representing the latent representations, to determine which data points are considered outliers and subsequently clamped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'std_dev' parameter specify in the ClampOutliers node?",
        "answer": "The 'std_dev' parameter in the ClampOutliers node specifies the threshold for clamping based on standard deviations from the mean, controlling the extent to which outliers are adjusted and impacting the normalization of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the ClampOutliers node adjust?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node adjusts latent representations, specifically targeting outliers in these representations to clamp them based on a specified standard deviation threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ClampOutliers node return after adjusting the values?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node returns the adjusted latent representations with outliers clamped according to the specified standard deviation threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the process of clamping outliers implemented by the ClampOutliers node?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node implements the process of clamping outliers by adjusting latent representations: it calculates the standard deviation and mean for each channel, then clamps each channel's values within the range defined by the specified standard deviation threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the ClampOutliers node categorized in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ClampOutliers node is categorized under 'latent/filters' in ComfyUI."
