        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactMakeImageList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple image inputs into a single list, which is essential for handling a collection of images as a unified entity and facilitating operations that span across multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the ImpactMakeImageList node require?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageList node requires 'image1' as the primary image input, which serves as the initial element in the resulting image list. The input type is 'IMAGE' with a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactMakeImageList node output?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageList node outputs a list of images aggregated from the input. The output dtype is 'IMAGE' and the Python dtype is 'List[torch.Tensor]', indicating a list of 'torch.Tensor' objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ImpactMakeImageList node classified?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageList node is classified in the category 'ImpactPack/Util' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ImpactMakeImageList node function synchronously on the CPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImpactMakeImageList node is of infra type 'CPU', indicating that it functions synchronously on the CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the common node used to process output lists from the ImpactMakeImageList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "A common node used to process output lists from the ImpactMakeImageList node is the 'ImageListToImageBatch' node, which can be found in the ComfyUI-Impact-Pack documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that aggregates multiple image inputs into an Image list in the ImpactMakeImageList node?",
        "answer": "The function that aggregates multiple image inputs into an Image list in the ImpactMakeImageList node is the 'doit' function."
