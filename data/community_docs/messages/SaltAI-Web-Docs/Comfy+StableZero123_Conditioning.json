        "question": "What is StableZero123_Conditioning?",
        "answer": "StableZero123_Conditioning is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for applying specific conditioning transformations tailored for the StableZero123 model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does StableZero123_Conditioning belong to?",
        "answer": "StableZero123_Conditioning belongs to the conditioning/3d_models category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by StableZero123_Conditioning?",
        "answer": "The inputs required by StableZero123_Conditioning include 'clip_vision' of type CLIP_VISION, 'init_image' of type IMAGE, 'vae' of type VAE, 'width' of type INT, 'height' of type INT, 'batch_size' of type INT, 'elevation' of type FLOAT, and 'azimuth' of type FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip_vision' input do for StableZero123_Conditioning?",
        "answer": "The 'clip_vision' input provides visual context or cues that the model can use to guide the generation process, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the 3D content produced."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does StableZero123_Conditioning utilize the 'init_image' input?",
        "answer": "StableZero123_Conditioning uses the 'init_image' input as an initial image or starting point for the generation process, allowing the model to modify or build upon this base to create the final 3D content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'vae' input play in StableZero123_Conditioning?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' input refers to a Variational Autoencoder used for encoding and decoding images, crucial for the model's ability to understand and manipulate visual data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does StableZero123_Conditioning provide?",
        "answer": "StableZero123_Conditioning provides 'positive' and 'negative' conditioning data types of type CONDITIONING, and a 'latent' output of type LATENT."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does StableZero123_Conditioning primarily use?",
        "answer": "StableZero123_Conditioning primarily uses the 'encode' function."
