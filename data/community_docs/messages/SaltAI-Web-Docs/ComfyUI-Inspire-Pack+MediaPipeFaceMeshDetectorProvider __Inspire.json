        "question": "What is the MediaPipeFaceMesh Detector Provider in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMesh Detector Provider is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to facilitate the detection of facial landmarks using MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the MediaPipeFaceMesh Detector Provider belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMesh Detector Provider node belongs to the 'InspirePack/Detector' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `max_faces` input represent in the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider?",
        "answer": "The `max_faces` input specifies the maximum number of faces to detect in the given image, which helps control the scope of the detection process within the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs help the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider detect facial parts, and what data type do they use?",
        "answer": "Inputs like `face`, `mouth`, `left_eyebrow`, `left_eye`, `left_pupil`, `right_eyebrow`, `right_eye`, and `right_pupil` help the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider detect specific facial parts. These inputs use the BOOLEAN data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider output, and in what form?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider outputs two types: a `bbox_detector` for bounding box detection of facial features and a `segm_detector` for segmentation detection, both in the form of `BBOX_DETECTOR` and `SEGM_DETECTOR` types, respectively, specific to ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider detect both bounding boxes and segmentation masks for facial features?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider outputs two detectors: one for bounding box detection (`bbox_detector`) and another for segmentation (`segm_detector`), both configured for facial feature detection using MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types associated with the output nodes of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider?",
        "answer": "The Python data types associated with the output nodes of the MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider are `MediaPipeFaceMeshDetector` for both `bbox_detector` and `segm_detector` outputs."
