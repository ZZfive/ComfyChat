        "question": "What is ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the weights of individual attention components in a model by applying multiplication factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult allow you to adjust?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult allows you to adjust the weights of various components including positional encoding, attention, query, key, value, output weights, output bias, and other unspecified model weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult enhance model performance?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult enhances model performance by fine-tuning the attention mechanism's parameters, thereby potentially improving the model's focus and adaptation to specific tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult include pe_MULT, attn_MULT, attn_q_MULT, attn_k_MULT, attn_v_MULT, attn_out_weight_MULT, attn_out_bias_MULT, other_MULT, and print_adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult handle positional encoding weights?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult handles positional encoding weights by allowing the specification of a multiplication factor (pe_MULT) that influences the contribution of positional information to the attention mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the print_adjustment flag do in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult?",
        "answer": "The print_adjustment flag in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult enables or disables printing of the adjustment details, useful for debugging or monitoring the adjustment process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult be used to modify attention mechanism biases?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnMult can modify attention mechanism biases by specifying a multiplication factor (attn_out_bias_MULT) that adjusts the bias of the attention mechanism's output."
