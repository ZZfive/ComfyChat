        "question": "What is the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The `easy imagePixelPerfect` node in ComfyUI is used to enhance image quality by adjusting the pixel perfection of images, focusing on optimizing resolution and sharpness for better visual clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node are `image` (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and `resize_mode` (Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING], Python dtype: List[str])."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `resize_mode` input in the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node?",
        "answer": "The `resize_mode` input in the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node specifies the mode of resizing to be applied to the image, affecting how the image's pixel perfection is enhanced, such as scaling to a specific dimension or maintaining aspect ratio while scaling down."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node produce?",
        "answer": "The `easy imagePixelPerfect` node produces an output type of `resolution` (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), indicating the enhanced pixel perfection of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node determine the optimized resolution?",
        "answer": "The `easy imagePixelPerfect` node determines the optimized resolution based on the original width and height of the input image and the specified `resize_mode`, calculating an estimation that reflects the enhanced pixel perfection."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node?",
        "answer": "The documentation for the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node does not specify any common nodes that are used with it; the information is listed as 'unknown'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What computational resource type does the `easy imagePixelPerfect` node recommend for processing?",
        "answer": "The `easy imagePixelPerfect` node recommends using the CPU for processing, as indicated in its 'Infra type'."
