        "question": "What is the CR Radial Gradient node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Radial Gradient node in ComfyUI is designed to create visually appealing radial gradient patterns, blending colors or intensities from a central point outward."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'width' input affect the radial gradient in ComfyUI's CR Radial Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input, of dtype 'INT', sets the width of the canvas, influencing the radial gradient's spread and how it occupies the visual space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'gradient_distance' input in ComfyUI's CR Radial Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_distance' input, of dtype 'FLOAT', specifies the extent of the gradient's transition area, affecting how gradually the colors blend from the center to the edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs are necessary to create a radial gradient pattern in ComfyUI using the CR Radial Gradient node?",
        "answer": "To create a radial gradient pattern, the required inputs are 'width', 'height', 'start_color', 'end_color', 'gradient_distance', 'radial_center_x', and 'radial_center_y'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the starting and ending colors of the radial gradient specified in ComfyUI using the CR Radial Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The starting and ending colors of the gradient are specified using the 'start_color' and 'end_color' inputs, which can be selected from a predefined set or be set as 'custom' which requires using the 'start_color_hex' and 'end_color_hex' inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'show_Help' output in ComfyUI's CR Radial Gradient node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_Help' output provides a link for further assistance or information about the radial gradient node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does the CR Radial Gradient node in ComfyUI support?",
        "answer": "Optional inputs for the CR Radial Gradient node include 'start_color_hex' and 'end_color_hex', which allow for the specification of the starting and ending colors in hexadecimal format respectively."
