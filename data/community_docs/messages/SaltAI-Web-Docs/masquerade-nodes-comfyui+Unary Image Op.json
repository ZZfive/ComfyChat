        "question": "What is the Unary Image Op node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unary Image Op node in ComfyUI is used to apply a specified unary operation on an image, such as inversion, averaging, rounding, clamping, or taking the absolute value, to manipulate the pixel values of the image according to the chosen operation, enabling various image preprocessing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Unary Image Op node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Unary Image Op node are `image`, which is the image to be processed, and `op`, which specifies the unary operation to apply, such as 'invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', or 'abs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Unary Image Op node output?",
        "answer": "The Unary Image Op node outputs an image of type `IMAGE` after applying the specified unary operation, with data type `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which unary operation does the Unary Image Op node use to change the brightness of an image?",
        "answer": "The Unary Image Op node uses the 'invert' unary operation to change the brightness of an image by inverting the pixel values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type and category of the Unary Image Op node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unary Image Op node has a data type `IMAGE` for its output and belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operation can be used for normalizing image brightness in ComfyUI's Unary Image Op node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI's Unary Image Op node, the 'average' unary operation can be used to normalize image brightness by calculating the average pixel value across the entire image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI offers rounding pixel values as one of its operations?",
        "answer": "The Unary Image Op node in ComfyUI offers rounding pixel values as one of its operations, specifically through the 'round' unary operation."
