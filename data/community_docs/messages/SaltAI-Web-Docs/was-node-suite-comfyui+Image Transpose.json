        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Transpose node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Transpose node in ComfyUI is designed to overlay one image onto another with specified dimensions, location, rotation, and feathering options, enabling complex image composition tasks with precise control over image combination and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Transpose node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Transpose node include `image` representing the base image, `image_overlay` specifying the image to be overlaid, `width` and `height` for the overlay size, `X` and `Y` for the overlay location, and `rotation` and `feathering` for the overlay transformation and edge blending."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI assists in merging images with adjustable parameters?",
        "answer": "The Image Transpose node in ComfyUI assists in merging images with adjustable parameters, such as dimensions, location, rotation, and feathering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `feathering` parameter adjust in the Image Transpose node?",
        "answer": "The `feathering` parameter in the Image Transpose node adjusts the feathering radius for the overlay edges, enabling smooth transitions between the overlay and the base image."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, how does one achieve precise control over image compositing?",
        "answer": "In the context of ComfyUI, precise control over image compositing is achieved using the Image Transpose node, which allows for the overlay of one image onto another with customizable dimensions, location, rotation, and feathering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `X` parameter used for in the Image Transpose node?",
        "answer": "The `X` parameter in the Image Transpose node specifies the X coordinate for the top-left corner of the overlay image on the base image, determining the overlay's horizontal placement."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Image Transpose node controls the vertical alignment of the overlay image?",
        "answer": "The `Y` parameter controls the vertical alignment of the overlay image in the Image Transpose node, determining its vertical placement on the base image."
