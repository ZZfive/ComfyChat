        "question": "What is the class name of the node that processes audio input in real-time?",
        "answer": "The class name is `SoundReactive`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SoundReactive node do?",
        "answer": "The SoundReactive node is designed to process audio input and adjust its behavior based on the sound level, reacting to variations in sound intensity within a specified frequency range."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter determines the degree of smoothing applied to the sound level by SoundReactive?",
        "answer": "The `smoothing_factor` input parameter determines the degree of smoothing applied to the sound level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `start_range_hz` input have in SoundReactive?",
        "answer": "The `start_range_hz` input has a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`."

        "question": "Which nodes can be used to create audio-reactive visualizations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `SoundReactive` node can be used to create audio-reactive visualizations in ComfyUI by processing audio input and adjusting its behavior based on the sound level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does SoundReactive provide that represents the simplified processed sound level?",
        "answer": "SoundReactive provides the `sound_level_int` output, which is an integer representation of the processed sound level."
