        "question": "What is the CR Combine Schedules node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Combine Schedules node is designed to merge multiple animation schedules into a single comprehensive schedule in ComfyUI, facilitating the integration of various animation sequences and enhancing the flexibility and complexity of animation planning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the CR Combine Schedules node?",
        "answer": "The CR Combine Schedules node has four optional input types: schedule_1, schedule_2, schedule_3, and schedule_4, each of which represents an animation schedule to be combined and has a Comfy dtype of SCHEDULE and Python dtype of List[str]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the CR Combine Schedules node generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Combine Schedules node outputs a combined list of schedules from all provided animation sequences, with a Comfy dtype of SCHEDULE, and a concatenated string representation of all schedules, with a Comfy dtype of STRING, intended for display or debugging purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the CR Combine Schedules node when multiple schedules are provided?",
        "answer": "When multiple schedules are provided to the CR Combine Schedules node, it merges them into a single comprehensive animation schedule, which can enhance the complexity and flexibility of animation planning in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CR Combine Schedules node represents the third animation schedule to be combined?",
        "answer": "The parameter `schedule_3` in the CR Combine Schedules node represents the third animation schedule to be combined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype for the combined schedules in the CR Combine Schedules node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype for the combined schedules in the CR Combine Schedules node is `SCHEDULE`, which is represented as a List[str] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `show_text` output of the CR Combine Schedules node?",
        "answer": "The `show_text` output of the CR Combine Schedules node is a concatenated string representation of all schedules, intended for display or debugging purposes in ComfyUI."
