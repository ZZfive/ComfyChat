        "question": "What does the Load Image Batch node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load Image Batch node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple images into a single batch tensor, dynamically combining input images based on provided parameters for batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Load Image Batch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load Image Batch node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/IO' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'label' input in Load Image Batch?",
        "answer": "The 'label' input in Load Image Batch assigns a label to the loaded batch, which is useful for identification and tracking purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Load Image Batch node handle RGBA images by default?",
        "answer": "By default, the Load Image Batch node controls whether RGBA images are allowed in the output batch through the 'allow_RGBA_output' parameter, accommodating images with transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Load Image Batch node output?",
        "answer": "The Load Image Batch node outputs a batch of aggregated images represented as a tensor, ready for further processing or analysis, and a text representation of filenames included in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the 'mode' parameter do in the Load Image Batch node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in Load Image Batch specifies the loading mode, which can be single or multiple images, affecting how images are aggregated into the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which circumstances does the Load Image Batch node print an error message?",
        "answer": "The Load Image Batch node prints an error message when no valid image is found for the specified index in single image mode, or if images are removed from the source directory in incremental image mode."
