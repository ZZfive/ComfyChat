        "question": "What is the CR Integer Range List node in ComfyUI and where does it belong in terms of category?",
        "answer": "The CR Integer Range List node in ComfyUI belongs to the category 'ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/âœ¨ Essential/ðŸ“œ List'. It is designed to generate a list of integers within a specified range, potentially repeating and reversing the sequence based on the provided parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ping_pong' parameter do in the CR Integer Range List node?",
        "answer": "The 'ping_pong' parameter in the CR Integer Range List node, when set to true, reverses the direction of the range on every other iteration, adding a back-and-forth pattern to the sequence of numbers generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CR Integer Range List node defines the starting point of the integer range?",
        "answer": "The 'start' parameter in the CR Integer Range List node defines the starting point of the integer range, setting the initial value from which the range generation begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what format does the CR Integer Range List node provide the list of generated integers?",
        "answer": "The CR Integer Range List node provides the list of generated integers in a Python list format, denoted as 'List[int]' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Integer Range List node control the difference between successive numbers in the sequence?",
        "answer": "The CR Integer Range List node controls the difference between successive numbers in the sequence through the 'step' parameter, which determines the increment between each integer in the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what purpose can the CR Integer Range List node be used in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Integer Range List node in ComfyUI can be used for various applications, such as scheduling or iterative processes, by generating complex sequences of numbers within a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'loops' parameter specify in the CR Integer Range List node?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter in the CR Integer Range List node specifies the number of times the entire range sequence is repeated, allowing for the generation of longer sequences by repeating the basic range pattern."
