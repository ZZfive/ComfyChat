        "question": "What is the purpose of the UNETLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UNETLoader node is designed for loading U-Net models by name, facilitating the use of pre-trained U-Net architectures within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the UNETLoader node?",
        "answer": "The UNETLoader node outputs a U-Net model with Comfy dtype `MODEL` and Python dtype `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can dynamically load different U-Net models based on their names?",
        "answer": "The UNETLoader node can dynamically load different U-Net models based on their names within a predefined directory structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `unet_name` input parameter of the UNETLoader node specify?",
        "answer": "The `unet_name` input parameter specifies the name of the U-Net model to be loaded, used to locate the model within a predefined directory structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype does the loaded U-Net model have when output by the UNETLoader node?",
        "answer": "The loaded U-Net model has the Python dtype `torch.nn.Module` when it is output by the UNETLoader node."
