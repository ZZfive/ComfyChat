        "question": "What is the purpose of the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Join XY Inputs of Same Type node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two XY inputs of the same type into a single output, handling different types of XY data with specific merging strategies for each type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node?",
        "answer": "The Join XY Inputs of Same Type node falls under the Efficiency Nodes/XY Inputs category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs does the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node require?",
        "answer": "The Join XY Inputs of Same Type node requires two XY inputs, represented as `XY_i`, to be merged. These inputs should be of the same type for the merge operation to proceed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node produce?",
        "answer": "The Join XY Inputs of Same Type node produces a merged output of the two XY inputs. The output is of type `XY`, which stands for `X or Y`, and it combines the data of the two inputs according to their merged type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the input types of the inputs to the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node do not match?",
        "answer": "If the input types of the inputs to the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node do not match, the node will print an error message stating that input types must match for the merge operation to be performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node handle merging when the input type is 'Seeds++ Batch'?",
        "answer": "When the input type is 'Seeds++ Batch', the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node handles the merging by combining the lengths of the two input lists and initializing a new list with the combined length."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node handle types 'Positive Prompt S/R' and 'Negative Prompt S/R' in merging?",
        "answer": "For input types 'Positive Prompt S/R' and 'Negative Prompt S/R', the Join XY Inputs of Same Type node handles merging by adding the second set of values to the first, except for the first element of the second set, which is replaced with the first element of the first set."
