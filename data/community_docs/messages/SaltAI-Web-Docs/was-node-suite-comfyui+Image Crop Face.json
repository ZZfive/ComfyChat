        "question": "What is the function of the Image Crop Face node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Crop Face node in ComfyUI specializes in detecting and cropping faces within images, optionally applying padding around the detected face area for better framing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input image is required for the Image Crop Face node?",
        "answer": "The Image Crop Face node requires an input image where a face needs to be detected and cropped. This input is crucial as it provides the visual data from which the node identifies and extracts the face."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the crop_padding_factor input specify in the Image Crop Face node?",
        "answer": "The crop_padding_factor input specifies the amount of padding to add around the detected face area before cropping. This helps ensure the face is well-framed within the cropped image, enhancing its visual appeal."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Crop Face node handle varying facial detection algorithms?",
        "answer": "The Image Crop Face node allows for flexibility in choosing different detection algorithms based on the application's requirements through the cascade_xml input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python dtype and Comfy dtype of the input image?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the input image in the Image Crop Face node is `PIL.Image.Image`, and the Comfy dtype is `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs of the Image Crop Face node?",
        "answer": "The outputs of the Image Crop Face node include the cropped image containing the detected face, potentially with added padding for better framing, and `crop_data` that provides details related to the cropping operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Image Crop Face node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Crop Face node falls in the 'WAS Suite/Image/Process' category in ComfyUI."
