        "question": "What does the VividSharpen node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VividSharpen node in ComfyUI enhances the sharpness and clarity of images by applying a vivid sharpening effect, utilizing a combination of Gaussian blur inversion and blending techniques to accentuate details and edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs does the VividSharpen node require?",
        "answer": "The VividSharpen node requires images to be sharpened, a radius for the Gaussian blur used in the sharpening process, and a strength value to control the intensity of the sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the intensity of the sharpening effect controlled in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The intensity of the sharpening effect in the VividSharpen node is controlled by the strength input, which is a float value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the extent of Gaussian blur in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The extent of Gaussian blur in the VividSharpen node is determined by the radius input, which is a float value that specifies the radius of the blur used in the sharpening process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the radius input in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the radius input in the VividSharpen node is 1.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VividSharpen node process images when multiple images are input?",
        "answer": "When multiple images are input, the VividSharpen node processes each image individually, applying the vivid sharpening effect to each one before combining the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the input and output images in the VividSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the input and output images in the VividSharpen node is IMAGE, which corresponds to a torch.Tensor in Python."
