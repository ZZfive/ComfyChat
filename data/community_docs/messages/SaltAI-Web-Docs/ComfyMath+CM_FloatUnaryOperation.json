        "question": "What is CM_FloatUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatUnaryOperation is a node in ComfyUI that performs unary operations on floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_FloatUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatUnaryOperation belongs to the category math/float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input requirement for CM_FloatUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatUnaryOperation requires two inputs: 'op', which specifies the unary operation to be performed, and 'a', which is the floating-point number to operate on."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_FloatUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_FloatUnaryOperation specifies the unary operation to be performed on the input float, influencing the outcome directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does CM_FloatUnaryOperation produce?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatUnaryOperation produces a float as output, which is the result of applying the specified unary operation on the input float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_FloatUnaryOperation handle its input types?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatUnaryOperation defines input types using Comfy dtype and Python dtype specifications for 'op' and 'a'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with CM_FloatUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with CM_FloatUnaryOperation is CPU."
