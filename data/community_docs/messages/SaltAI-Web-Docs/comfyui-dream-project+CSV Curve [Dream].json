        "question": "What is CSV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "CSV Curve [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI designed to interpret and apply animation curves based on data extracted from CSV files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for CSV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CSV Curve [Dream] include frame_counter, csvfile, first_column_type, interpolate, and csv_dialect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CSV Curve [Dream] interpret CSV data?",
        "answer": "CSV Curve [Dream] interprets CSV data by dynamically parsing the CSV file specified in the 'csvfile' input and applying it to generate animation curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'interpolate' input in CSV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolate' input in CSV Curve [Dream] controls whether interpolation is applied between data points in the CSV file, allowing for smoother transitions in the generated animation curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'first_column_type' input determine in CSV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The 'first_column_type' input in CSV Curve [Dream] determines whether the first column of the CSV file represents seconds or frames, affecting how the data is interpreted in the context of animation timing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CSV Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The output types of CSV Curve [Dream] include FLOAT and INT, representing different precision levels of the generated animation curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CSV Curve [Dream] node handle CSV files with different formatting conventions?",
        "answer": "The CSV Curve [Dream] node handles CSV files with different formatting conventions by specifying the 'csv_dialect' input, which allows accurate parsing of CSV files."
