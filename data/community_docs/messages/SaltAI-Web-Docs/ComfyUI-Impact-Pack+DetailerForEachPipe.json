    {
        "question": "Which nodes are considered common for DetailerForEachPipe?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with DetailerForEachPipe are unspecified in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the wildcard input in DetailerForEachPipe?",
        "answer": "The wildcard input in DetailerForEachPipe provides additional, dynamic context or parameters that can be used to customize the processing of each item in the collection, allowing for more tailored and nuanced detail extraction or enhancement."

    {
        "question": "What are the output types of DetailerForEachPipe?",
        "answer": "The output types of DetailerForEachPipe include `image`, `segs`, `basic_pipe`, and `cnet_images`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of input nodes can directly influence the detail extraction or enhancement in DetailerForEachPipe?",
        "answer": "Input nodes that can directly influence detail extraction or enhancement in DetailerForEachPipe are `segs`, `guide_size`, `guide_size_for`, `max_size`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, `denoise`, `feather`, `noise_mask`, and `force_inpaint`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of guide_size and guide_size_for inputs on the processing of images in DetailerForEachPipe?",
        "answer": "The `guide_size` and `guide_size_for` inputs affect the resizing of images in DetailerForEachPipe. `guide_size` specifies the size to which the images will be resized, while `guide_size_for` determines whether this size adjustment is based on the bounding box (`True`) or the crop region (`False`), affecting the detailed analysis."
