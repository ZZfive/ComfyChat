        "question": "What is CM_Vec2UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryCondition is a class in ComfyUI that performs unary condition operations on 2-dimensional vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2UnaryCondition belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryCondition belongs to the 'math/vec2' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec2UnaryCondition output?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryCondition outputs a boolean value ('bool') that indicates whether the specified unary condition holds true for the given 2-dimensional vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for CM_Vec2UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryCondition requires two inputs: 'op', which specifies the unary condition operation as a string, and 'a', which is a 2-dimensional vector on which the operation is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'op' parameter work in CM_Vec2UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in CM_Vec2UnaryCondition specifies the unary condition operation to be performed on the input vector 'a'. The choice of operation affects the outcome of the condition evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the 'a' input correspond to in CM_Vec2UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "In CM_Vec2UnaryCondition, the 'a' input corresponds to the Python data type 'Vec2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by CM_Vec2UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryCondition uses the infrastructure type 'CPU'."
