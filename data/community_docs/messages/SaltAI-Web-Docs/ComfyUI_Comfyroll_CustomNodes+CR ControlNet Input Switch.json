        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR ControlNet Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR ControlNet Input Switch node in ComfyUI serves as a dynamic switch between two control networks based on a specified input, enhancing flexibility and control in the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the selection of the control network in the CR ControlNet Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The selection of the control network in the CR ControlNet Input Switch node is determined by the 'Input' parameter, which is an integer that determines which of the two control networks to use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the input and output of the CR ControlNet Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter in the CR ControlNet Input Switch node uses the 'INT' type with a Comfy dtype of 'INT' and a Python dtype of 'int'. The output 'CONTROL_NET' has a Comfy dtype of 'CONTROL_NET' and the Python dtype is also 'CONTROL_NET'. The 'show_help' output is a 'STRING' with a Comfy dtype of 'STRING' and a Python dtype of 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What options are available for input in the CR ControlNet Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The CR ControlNet Input Switch node in ComfyUI allows for the input of 'control_net1' and 'control_net2', which are two 'CONTROL_NET' options that can be selected based on the input."
