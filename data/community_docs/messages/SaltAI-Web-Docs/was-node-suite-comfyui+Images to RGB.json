        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Images to RGB' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a collection of images to the RGB color space, ensuring consistency in color representation across multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Images to RGB' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input required for the 'Images to RGB' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node requires a collection of images, specified as 'images', with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'List[Image]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'Images to RGB' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node outputs images standardized in the RGB color space, with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'List[Image]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Images to RGB' node function do with the input images?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node function, 'image_to_rgb', converts all input images to the RGB color space, facilitating uniform color representation for further processing or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what infra type is the 'Images to RGB' node commonly used?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to RGB' node is commonly used in a CPU infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'image_to_rgb' function handle multiple images in ComfyUI's 'Images to RGB' node?",
        "answer": "If multiple images are input, the 'image_to_rgb' function converts each image to the RGB color space individually, then concatenates them into a tensor collection for output."
