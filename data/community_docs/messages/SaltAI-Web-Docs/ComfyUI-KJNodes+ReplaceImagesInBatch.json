        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReplaceImagesInBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReplaceImagesInBatch node in ComfyUI is designed to replace a subset of images within a batch with a new set of images, starting from a specified index, to facilitate the modification of image batches by allowing selective replacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type is associated with the input parameter 'original_images' in the ReplaceImagesInBatch node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type associated with the input parameter 'original_images' in the ReplaceImagesInBatch node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter determines the starting point for replacement in the ReplaceImagesInBatch node?",
        "answer": "The input parameter 'start_index' determines the starting point for replacement in the ReplaceImagesInBatch node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What error is raised if the 'start_index' parameter is out of range in the ReplaceImagesInBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ReplaceImagesInBatch node raises a ValueError if the 'start_index' parameter is out of range, indicating that the start index is not valid for the replacement operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is the ReplaceImagesInBatch node categorized under in terms of infrastructure?",
        "answer": "The ReplaceImagesInBatch node is categorized under the infrastructure type 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ReplaceImagesInBatch node output, and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The ReplaceImagesInBatch node outputs a modified batch of images after the replacement operation, with the data type of the output being torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ReplaceImagesInBatch node handle the replacement of images when the specified range is within the original image batch?",
        "answer": "The ReplaceImagesInBatch node handles the replacement of images within the specified range by creating a copy of the original_images tensor and then replacing the specified range with 'replacement_images'."
