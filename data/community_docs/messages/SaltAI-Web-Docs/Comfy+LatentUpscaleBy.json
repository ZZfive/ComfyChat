        "question": "What is LatentUpscaleBy?",
        "answer": "LatentUpscaleBy is a class name in ComfyUI categorized under latent nodes, specifically designed for upscaling latent representations of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LatentUpscaleBy node do?",
        "answer": "The LatentUpscaleBy node upscales latent representations of images, enhancing their resolution based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by LatentUpscaleBy?",
        "answer": "LatentUpscaleBy requires inputs such as 'samples', which are the latent representations of images, 'upscale_method' to specify the upscaling method, and 'scale_by' to determine the scaling factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LatentUpscaleBy node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentUpscaleBy node is the upscaled latent representation, formatted as a dictionary of tensors ready for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentUpscaleBy determine the width and height of upscaled samples?",
        "answer": "LatentUpscaleBy determines the width and height of upscaled samples by multiplying the original dimensions of the latent samples with the 'scale_by' factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with LatentUpscaleBy?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used alongside LatentUpscaleBy include KSampler, Reroute, VAEDecode, and KSampler (Efficient), each contributing to different stages of the image generation or processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What methods are available for upscaling in LatentUpscaleBy?",
        "answer": "LatentUpscaleBy supports various upscaling methods such as 'nearest-exact', 'bilinear', 'area', 'bicubic', and 'bislerp', each affecting the quality and characteristics of the upscaled output differently."
