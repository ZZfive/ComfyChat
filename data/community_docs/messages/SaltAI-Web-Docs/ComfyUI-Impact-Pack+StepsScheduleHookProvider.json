    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'schedule_for_iteration' input in the StepsScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_for_iteration' input specifies the scheduling strategy to be used for iteration adjustments. The choice of schedule affects how the number of steps is dynamically adjusted during the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'target_steps' parameter utilized by the StepsScheduleHookProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'target_steps' parameter defines the target number of steps to aim for at the end of the generation process. This parameter directly influences the adjustment of steps in the generative task, aiming to reach the specified target."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the StepsScheduleHookProvider node return?",
        "answer": "The StepsScheduleHookProvider node returns a 'PK_HOOK' output which is a hook configured to adjust the number of steps in the generative process according to the specified schedule and target steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure does the StepsScheduleHookProvider node utilize?",
        "answer": "The StepsScheduleHookProvider node utilizes the 'CPU' as its infrastructure type."
