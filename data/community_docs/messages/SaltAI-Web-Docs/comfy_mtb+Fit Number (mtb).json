        "question": "What is the Fit Number (mtb) node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Fit Number (mtb) node is designed to adjust numerical values to fit within a specified range, with an optional easing function for smoothing the transition between values. It automatically computes the source range if required, providing flexibility for scaling dynamic data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `clamp` parameter in the Fit Number (mtb) node do?",
        "answer": "The `clamp` parameter in the Fit Number (mtb) node is a boolean that indicates whether the transformed value should be clamped to the target range, preventing it from exceeding the specified minimum and maximum values."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to automatically scale input values to a target range?",
        "answer": "The Fit Number (mtb) node in ComfyUI can be used to automatically scale input values to a target range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What range does the `value` parameter operate within in the Fit Number (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `value` parameter in the Fit Number (mtb) node operates within the source range, and it is transformed to fit within the target range after adjusting it according to the specified easing function and clamping if enabled."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Fit Number (mtb) node determine the source range for a value?",
        "answer": "The Fit Number (mtb) node can determine the source range for a value either based on the `source_min` and `source_max` parameters provided, or it can compute the source range automatically based on the input values if the parameters are not specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Fit Number (mtb) node output, and what type is it?",
        "answer": "The Fit Number (mtb) node outputs a `float` value that has been adjusted to fit within the specified target range, potentially smoothed by an easing function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the type of the input `easing` parameter in the Fit Number (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The input `easing` parameter in the Fit Number (mtb) node is of type `COMBO[STRING]`, specifying the easing function to apply during the scaling process, which affects how the value transitions across the range."
