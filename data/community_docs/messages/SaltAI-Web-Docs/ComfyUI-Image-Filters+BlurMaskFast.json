        "question": "What is the BlurMaskFast node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BlurMaskFast node is designed to apply a Gaussian blur to masks, allowing for the softening of edges and the creation of a smoother mask appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' input represent in the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input in the BlurMaskFast node specifies the masks to be blurred, defining the areas within the image where the blur effect will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius_x' parameter affect the output of the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The 'radius_x' parameter determines the horizontal radius of the Gaussian blur. A larger radius results in a more pronounced blur effect horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of increasing the 'radius_y' parameter in the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "Increasing the 'radius_y' parameter results in a more pronounced blur effect vertically in the output mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are accepted by the BlurMaskFast node for the 'masks', 'radius_x', and 'radius_y' inputs?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input accepts the Comfy dtype `MASK` (which is a `torch.Tensor` in Python), and the 'radius_x' and 'radius_y' inputs accept the Comfy dtype `INT` (an `int` in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output produced by the BlurMaskFast node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BlurMaskFast node is a mask that has been smoothed by the Gaussian blur process, with softer edges compared to the original, represented as the Comfy dtype `MASK` (a `torch.Tensor` in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'blur_mask' method in the BlurMaskFast class?",
        "answer": "The 'blur_mask' method in the BlurMaskFast class applies a Gaussian blur to the input masks based on the specified 'radius_x' and 'radius_y' parameters."
