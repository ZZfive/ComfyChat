        "question": "What is the 'Cut By Mask' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Cut By Mask' node in ComfyUI is designed to precisely extract or isolate parts of an image based on a specified mask, allowing for resizing to specific dimensions and handling multiple image segments in a batch with mask mappings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Cut By Mask' node use as the primary canvas from which parts are cut out?",
        "answer": "The 'Cut By Mask' node uses the 'image' input as the primary canvas from which parts are cut out based on the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the areas to be cut out in the 'Cut By Mask' node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the 'Cut By Mask' node defines the areas of the input image to be cut out, acting as a stencil to specify which parts of the image are to be extracted or isolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'force_resize_width' input in the 'Cut By Mask' node?",
        "answer": "The 'force_resize_width' input in the 'Cut By Mask' node specifies an optional width to which the cut-out image(s) will be resized, allowing for the standardization of output dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'force_resize_height' input in the 'Cut By Mask' node enable?",
        "answer": "The 'force_resize_height' input in the 'Cut By Mask' node allows for the standardization of output sizes across different cut-outs by specifying an optional height to which the cut-out image(s) will be resized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Cut By Mask' node handle multiple image segments when provided with mask mappings?",
        "answer": "The 'Cut By Mask' node can handle multiple image segments in a single operation based on distinct mask parts when provided with mask mappings from a 'Separate Mask Components' node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the 'Cut By Mask' node provide after processing?",
        "answer": "The 'Cut By Mask' node outputs the image(s) after being cut by the mask, which can be a single image or multiple images, depending on whether mask mapping was used, and resized as specified."
