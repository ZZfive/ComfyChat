    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec4UnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec4' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_Vec4UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input specifies the unary operation to be performed on the Vec4 input. It determines the type of mathematical manipulation applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec4UnaryOperation handle the 'op' input?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryOperation handles the 'op' input by allowing a choice from various unary operations defined in VEC_UNARY_OPERATIONS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does CM_Vec4UnaryOperation produce?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryOperation produces a Vec4 output, which is the result of applying the specified unary operation on the input Vec4."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'a' input in CM_Vec4UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'a' input in CM_Vec4UnaryOperation is Vec4."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec4UnaryOperation facilitate mathematical computations?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryOperation facilitates mathematical computations by abstracting complex vector manipulations into callable operations on 4-dimensional vectors."
