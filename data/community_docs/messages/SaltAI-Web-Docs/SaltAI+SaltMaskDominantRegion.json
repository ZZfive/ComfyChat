        "question": "What is the SaltMaskDominantRegion node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskDominantRegion node in ComfyUI is used for identifying and isolating the dominant region within a given set of masks based on a specified threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the `masks` parameter in SaltMaskDominantRegion?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the `masks` parameter in SaltMaskDominantRegion is of Comfy dtype `MASK` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SaltMaskDominantRegion define the 'dominant' area within the masks?",
        "answer": "SaltMaskDominantRegion defines the 'dominant' area within the masks by using a threshold value which acts as a cutoff intensity value to distinguish the dominant region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the `threshold` parameter use in SaltMaskDominantRegion?",
        "answer": "In SaltMaskDominantRegion, the `threshold` parameter uses Comfy dtype `INT` and Python dtype `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltMaskDominantRegion node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltMaskDominantRegion node is a tensor of masks (Comfy dtype: `MASK`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`) with the dominant region highlighted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the threshold in determining the dominant region in SaltMaskDominantRegion?",
        "answer": "The threshold in SaltMaskDominantRegion plays a pivotal role in setting a cutoff intensity value which helps in distinguishing the dominant region within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of tasks is SaltMaskDominantRegion suitable for?",
        "answer": "SaltMaskDominantRegion is suitable for tasks that require focus on significant mask regions, making it useful for applications needing to highlight or manipulate the primary area within the masks."
