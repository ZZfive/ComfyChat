        "question": "What is the Animation Builder (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Animation Builder (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to manage frame sequencing, scaling, and looping for creating animations, providing a structured approach to generating complex animation sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Animation Builder (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Animation Builder (mtb) node belongs to the `mtb/animation` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the total number of frames in animations created with the Animation Builder (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The total number of frames in animations created with the Animation Builder (mtb) node is determined by the `total_frames` input, which specifies the length of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the Animation Builder (mtb) node adjusts the scaling of animations?",
        "answer": "The `scale_float` input of the Animation Builder (mtb) node adjusts the scaling of animations by applying a scaling factor to the normalized current value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the looping of animations controlled in the Animation Builder (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The looping of animations in the Animation Builder (mtb) node is controlled by the `loop_count` input, which determines the number of times the animation sequence is looped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Animation Builder (mtb) node provide?",
        "answer": "The Animation Builder (mtb) node provides outputs including the current frame number (`frame`), the scaled value of the current frame (`0-1 (scaled)`), the current loop count (`count`), and a boolean indicating whether the loop has ended (`loop_ended`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `raw_iteration` input represent in the Animation Builder (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `raw_iteration` input in the Animation Builder (mtb) node represents an internal counter used to track the current iteration within the animation loop, facilitating frame sequencing."
