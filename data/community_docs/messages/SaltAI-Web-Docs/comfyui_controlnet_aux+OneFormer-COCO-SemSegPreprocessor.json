        "question": "What is the purpose of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node performs semantic segmentation on images using a pre-trained OneFormer model. It identifies and delineates each semantic object within an image to enhance the understanding of its content at a pixel level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required for the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node requires an input image to be semantically segmented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the OneFormer-COCO Segmentor?",
        "answer": "The class name of the OneFormer-COCO Segmentor is `OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution parameter affect the output of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution parameter specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before segmentation, which can lead to more precise segmentations at higher resolutions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is a semantic segmentation image where each pixel's value corresponds to a semantic class."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Nodes commonly used with the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node include ImageToMask and ControlNetApply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for running the OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor node is designed to run on a GPU infrastructure."
