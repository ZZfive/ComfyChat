    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageDrawLineByContainer?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageDrawLineByContainer include 'container' (IMAGE), 'size' (INT), 'start_x' (FLOAT), 'start_y' (FLOAT), 'end_x' (FLOAT), 'end_y' (FLOAT), 'red' (INT), 'green' (INT), 'blue' (INT), 'alpha' (FLOAT), 'SSAA' (INT), and 'method' (COMBO[STRING])."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageDrawLineByContainer abstract image manipulation complexity?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawLineByContainer abstracts image manipulation complexity by handling the drawing of lines on images without requiring the user to manage low-level image processing operations."

    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageDrawLineByContainer node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageDrawLineByContainer node is an image with the specified line drawn on it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SSAA parameter do in ImageDrawLineByContainer?",
        "answer": "The SSAA parameter in ImageDrawLineByContainer specifies the Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor, which improves the quality of the line drawing by reducing aliasing artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for ImageDrawLineByContainer?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawLineByContainer operates on CPU infrastructures and is categorized under image/draw. However, specific information about common nodes it interacts with is unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the method parameter influence line rendering in ImageDrawLineByContainer?",
        "answer": "The method parameter in ImageDrawLineByContainer determines the algorithm used for line rendering, offering options such as 'lanczos', 'bicubic', 'hamming', 'bilinear', 'box', and 'nearest'."
