        "question": "What is the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI is designed to generate shape-based masks along a specified path, enabling the creation of dynamic and animated masking effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node belongs to the KJNodes/masking/generate category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What shapes can the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI create masks of?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node in ComfyUI can create masks of a circle, square, or triangle shape, offering a variety of visual styles for the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type determines the amount by which the shape grows on each frame in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The 'grow' input type determines the amount by which the shape grows on each frame in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node, enabling the creation of animated masks that change size over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateShapeMaskOnPath node generates a primary output mask based on the specified shape and path coordinates, as well as an inverted version of the primary mask, offering an alternative masking option where the shape's area is transparent and the surrounding area is opaque."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the dimensions of the frame within which the mask is created in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The dimensions of the frame within which the mask is created in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node are set by the 'frame_width' and 'frame_height' input types, defining the spatial boundaries for mask generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type specifies the initial height of the shape used to create the mask in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node?",
        "answer": "The 'shape_height' input type specifies the initial height of the shape used to create the mask in the CreateShapeMaskOnPath node, affecting the mask's size and coverage area."
