        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node is designed to conditionally halt the iteration process within a workflow based on a specified condition, serving as a control mechanism to dynamically manage the flow of execution based on logical conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input required by the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node requires a boolean input `cond` that determines whether the iteration should be stopped. If `cond` is true, the iteration is halted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node do when the `cond` input is true?",
        "answer": "When the `cond` input is true, the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node sends a 'stop-iteration' message to halt the iteration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node falls under the category of ImpactPack/Logic in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node have any output types?",
        "answer": "No, the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node doesn't have any output types; it serves solely as a means to control the flow of the iteration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of execution does the ImpactConditionalStopIteration node support?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalStopIteration node supports CPU-based execution for dynamically managing the iteration flow within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `doit` method within the ImpactConditionalStopIteration's source code?",
        "answer": "The `doit` method within the ImpactConditionalStopIteration's source code is responsible for checking the `cond` input and, if true, sending a 'stop-iteration' message to halt the iteration process."
