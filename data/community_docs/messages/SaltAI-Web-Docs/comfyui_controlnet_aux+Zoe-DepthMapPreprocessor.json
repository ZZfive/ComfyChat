        "question": "What is the purpose of the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images for depth map estimation using the Zoe Detector model. It adjusts the input image's resolution and processes it through the model to generate a depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor node belongs to the category of 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Normal and Depth Estimators' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used together with the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvanced and PreviewImage nodes are commonly used together with the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input image for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The data type of the input image for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI is 'IMAGE' with a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input parameter for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional input parameter for the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI is the 'resolution', which specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor generate from an input image?",
        "answer": "The Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor generates a depth map from an input image. This depth map provides a per-pixel estimation of depth, useful for understanding the scene's spatial layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor in ComfyUI is 'GPU'."
