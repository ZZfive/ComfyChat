        "question": "What is PerpNeg?",
        "answer": "PerpNeg is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the conditioning of a model using perpendicular negative guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does PerpNeg aim to enhance?",
        "answer": "PerpNeg aims to enhance the generation of content that diverges from undesired directions, guiding the model towards more desirable outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does PerpNeg require?",
        "answer": "PerpNeg requires inputs such as 'model' of type MODEL, 'empty_conditioning' of type CONDITIONING, and 'neg_scale' of type FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PerpNeg adjust the input conditioning vectors?",
        "answer": "PerpNeg adjusts the input conditioning vectors by calculating and adjusting positive and negative deviations relative to the 'empty_conditioning' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of PerpNeg?",
        "answer": "The output of PerpNeg is a modified version of the input model, adjusted with perpendicular negative guidance to influence its generation process towards desired outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'neg_scale' parameter control?",
        "answer": "The 'neg_scale' parameter controls the intensity of the negative guidance applied by PerpNeg, allowing fine-tuning of its effect on the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does PerpNeg belong to?",
        "answer": "PerpNeg belongs to the '_for_testing' category within ComfyUI."
