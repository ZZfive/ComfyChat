        "question": "What is the ImpactSEGSLabelFilter node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSLabelFilter node is designed to filter segments (SEGS) based on specified labels, allowing for the selective processing of image segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of segments does ImpactSEGSLabelFilter support filtering?",
        "answer": "It supports custom label lists, including special groupings like 'eyes' or 'eyebrows', to fine-tune the segments that are included or excluded from further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter is crucial for determining which segments of the image are processed in ImpactSEGSLabelFilter?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter represents the segments to be filtered and is crucial for determining which segments of the image are subject to processing based on the labels provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'preset' parameter function in ImpactSEGSLabelFilter?",
        "answer": "The 'preset' parameter allows for the selection of predefined label sets or custom labels for filtering, playing a key role in defining the scope of segments to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'labels' parameter in ImpactSEGSLabelFilter determine?",
        "answer": "The 'labels' parameter specifies the list of labels based on which the segments are filtered, directly influencing which segments are included or excluded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What two outputs does ImpactSEGSLabelFilter produce?",
        "answer": "ImpactSEGSLabelFilter produces two outputs: 'filtered_SEGS' which contains the segments that match the specified labels, and 'remained_SEGS' which includes the segments that did not match the specified labels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the input and output types defined for ImpactSEGSLabelFilter?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter is of type 'SEGS', 'preset' is of type 'COMBO[STRING]', and 'labels' is of type 'STRING'. The output types are both 'SEGS' for 'filtered_SEGS' and 'remained_SEGS'."
