        "question": "What is CR Debatch Frames?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames is a custom node in the Comfyroll Studio plugin for ComfyUI, categorized under Animation and Utilities, designed to transform a batch of image frames into a list of individual frames for frame-by-frame processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CR Debatch Frames handle the input frames?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames takes an input 'frames' parameter, which is a batch of image frames represented as a torch.Tensor, and debatches them into individual frames for separate handling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data can CR Debatch Frames accept as input?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames can accept the input 'frames' as 'IMAGE' data type in ComfyUI, which is essentially a torch.Tensor representing a batch of image frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CR Debatch Frames return as 'debatched_frames'?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames returns 'debatched_frames', a list of individual image frames, each as a torch.Tensor, facilitating frame-by-frame manipulation or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of processing does CR Debatch Frames enable for animation workflows?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames enables frame-by-frame processing for animation workflows, where each frame can be handled individually for effects or analysis, by debatching a batch of image frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that CR Debatch Frames utilizes to debatch frames?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames utilizes the 'debatch' function to transform the input batch of image frames into a list of individual frames for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which infra type is CR Debatch Frames defined to operate?",
        "answer": "CR Debatch Frames is defined to operate on the GPU infra type, which is crucial for handling the computational demands of frame manipulation and animation workflows."
