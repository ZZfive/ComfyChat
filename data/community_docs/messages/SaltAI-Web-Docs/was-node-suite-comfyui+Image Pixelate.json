        "question": "What is the Image Pixelate node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Image Pixelate node in ComfyUI is designed to transform images into pixel art by applying pixelation, color reduction, and optionally dithering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Image Pixelate node require?",
        "answer": "The Image Pixelate node requires the following inputs: images, pixelation_size, num_colors, init_mode, max_iterations, and dither, with optional inputs color_palettes, color_palette_mode, and reverse_palette."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default pixelation_size value when using the Image Pixelate node?",
        "answer": "The default pixelation_size value when using the Image Pixelate node is 164."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs are responsible for color reduction in the Image Pixelate node?",
        "answer": "The num_colors and init_mode inputs are responsible for color reduction in the Image Pixelate node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the dither input control in the Image Pixelate node?",
        "answer": "The dither input in the Image Pixelate node enables or disables dithering, a technique to simulate additional colors and gradients through patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the color_palettes input in the Image Pixelate node?",
        "answer": "The color_palettes input in the Image Pixelate node is a list of color palettes to be used for coloring the pixel art, offering additional customization for the final appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the color_palette_mode input in the Image Pixelate node?",
        "answer": "The color_palette_mode input in the Image Pixelate node determines how the color palettes are applied, affecting the gradient and transition between colors."
