        "question": "What is the class name for the node used to decode latent representations into images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node used to decode latent representations into images in ComfyUI is VAEDecode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the VAEDecode node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAEDecode node belongs to the 'latent' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' parameter represent in the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "In the VAEDecode node, the 'samples' parameter represents the latent representations to be decoded into images. It is crucial for the decoding process as it provides the compressed data from which the images are reconstructed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'vae' parameter play in the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter in the VAEDecode node specifies the Variational Autoencoder model to be used for decoding the latent representations into images. It determines the decoding mechanism and the quality of the reconstructed images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'samples' parameter in the VAEDecode node's input?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'samples' parameter in the VAEDecode node's input is 'LATENT' in Comfy dtype and 'torch.Tensor' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the VAEDecode node generate?",
        "answer": "The VAEDecode node generates an output of 'image' type with Comfy dtype as 'IMAGE' and Python dtype as 'torch.Tensor'. The output is an image reconstructed from the provided latent representation using the specified VAE model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the VAEDecode node?",
        "answer": "The PreviewImage, SaveImage, VHS_VideoCombine, ImageUpscaleWithModel, UltimateSDUpscale, RIFE VFI, FaceDetailer, FILM VFI, and ColorMatch nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the VAEDecode node."
