        "question": "What is the Mask Erode Region node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Mask Erode Region node is designed to perform erosion on specified mask regions, effectively shrinking the mask areas based on the number of iterations specified, which is useful for refining mask boundaries or reducing noise in mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input masks used for in the Mask Erode Region node?",
        "answer": "The input masks determine the regions within the image that will undergo the erosion process in the Mask Erode Region node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the iterations parameter specify in the Mask Erode Region node?",
        "answer": "The iterations parameter in the Mask Erode Region node specifies the number of times the erosion operation is applied to the mask regions. A higher number of iterations results in more pronounced erosion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the Mask Erode Region node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the Mask Erode Region node is `MASK` in ComfyUI's context and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Mask Erode Region node belong to in the ComfyUI node library?",
        "answer": "The Mask Erode Region node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Masking`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing does the Mask Erode Region node primarily use?",
        "answer": "The Mask Erode Region node primarily uses GPU for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name of the Mask Erode Region node in its source code?",
        "answer": "The function name of the Mask Erode Region node in its source code is `erode_region`."
