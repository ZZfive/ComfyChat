        "question": "What is the CR Starburst Lines node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Starburst Lines node is designed to generate a starburst pattern with lines radiating from a central point, allowing customization of various aspects such as the number of lines, their length, color, and rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CR Starburst Lines node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CR Starburst Lines node includes an IMAGE of the starburst pattern and a STRING containing a URL to documentation or help page related to the starburst pattern generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs determine the size of the canvas for the starburst pattern?",
        "answer": "The width and height inputs determine the size of the canvas for the starburst pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the density of the lines in the starburst pattern be controlled?",
        "answer": "The density of the lines in the starburst pattern can be controlled by specifying the number of lines using the num_lines input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the line_length input define in the CR Starburst Lines node?",
        "answer": "The line_length input defines the length of each line in the starburst pattern, affecting how far the lines extend from the center."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the color of the lines in the starburst pattern be customized?",
        "answer": "The color of the lines in the starburst pattern can be customized using the line_color input, which accepts a predefined color or a custom hex value specified in line_color_hex if 'line_color' is set to 'custom'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the starburst pattern oriented using the rotation input?",
        "answer": "The rotation input specifies the rotation angle of the entire starburst pattern, allowing it to be oriented in any direction."
