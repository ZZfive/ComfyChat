        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Prompt Scheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Prompt Scheduler node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and schedule animation prompts based on predefined rules and formats, facilitating the creation of complex animations by dynamically adjusting prompts and their attributes according to the current frame and scheduling mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the prompt selection and management in the CR Prompt Scheduler for an animation?",
        "answer": "Prompt selection and management in the CR Prompt Scheduler for an animation is determined by the specified scheduling mode, which dictates how prompts are chosen and handled throughout the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the frame from which the CR Prompt Scheduler selects the appropriate prompt?",
        "answer": "The input that controls the frame from which the CR Prompt Scheduler selects the appropriate prompt is the `current_frame` input, indicating the current frame of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `default_prompt` input in the CR Prompt Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The `default_prompt` input in the CR Prompt Scheduler node is used as the default prompt when the scheduler is disabled or when no other prompts are applicable."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the format of the schedule in the CR Prompt Scheduler be defined?",
        "answer": "The format of the schedule in the CR Prompt Scheduler can be defined using the `schedule_format` input, allowing for compatibility with different scheduling syntaxes."

    {
        "question": "What does the `interpolate_prompt` input control in the CR Prompt Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The `interpolate_prompt` input in the CR Prompt Scheduler controls whether to interpolate between prompts when transitioning from one keyframe to another, affecting the smoothness of the transition between different animation prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output provides the link to further documentation or help regarding the CR Prompt Scheduler in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output that provides a link to further documentation or help regarding the CR Prompt Scheduler in ComfyUI is the `show_help` output, returning a string containing the URL to the documentation."
