        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorRestoreFace node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorRestoreFace node in ComfyUI is designed to restore faces in images using specified face restoration models, blending the restored face with the original for a natural effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ReActorRestoreFace node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorRestoreFace node belongs to the 'ðŸŒŒ ReActor' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which required input controls the blend level between the original and restored faces in the ReActorRestoreFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'visibility' input, which is of type 'FLOAT' and controls the blend level between the original and restored faces, determining the visibility of the restoration effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'codeformer_weight' input parameter influence in the ReActorRestoreFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'codeformer_weight' input parameter influences the restoration outcome specifically when using the CodeFormer model for face restoration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ReActorRestoreFace node to process images?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ReActorRestoreFace node include the 'image' to be processed, the 'facedetection' model for identifying faces, the 'model' to specify the restoration technique, the 'visibility' for blend control, and the 'codeformer_weight' for influencing restoration outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in the ReActorRestoreFace node serves as the base for detecting faces and applying restoration models?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input serves as the base for detecting faces and applying restoration models in the ReActorRestoreFace node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ReActorRestoreFace node designed for CPU or GPU processing?",
        "answer": "The ReActorRestoreFace node is designed for GPU processing, as indicated by the 'Infra type: GPU' in its usage tips."
