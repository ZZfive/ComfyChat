        "question": "What is the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node is designed to generate a custom-sized latent representation based on specified width and height dimensions, tailored for the SDXL latent format."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node belong to in the ComfyUI node list?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node belongs to the 'Mikey/Latent' category in the ComfyUI node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node is `latent` with the Comfy dtype `LATENT` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `width` input parameter determine in the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node?",
        "answer": "The `width` input parameter in the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node specifies the desired width of the latent representation, which is used to determine the final size of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `height` input parameter relevant to the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node?",
        "answer": "The `height` input parameter in the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node specifies the desired height of the latent representation, which influences the final size of the latent space according to predefined ratios or calculations for SDXL format compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `batch_size` input parameter control in the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` input parameter in the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node determines the number of latent representations to generate in a single batch, which allows for the simultaneous generation of multiple latents to enhance efficiency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required to execute the Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node effectively?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL node requires an 'Infra type: GPU' for effective execution, implying that it is optimized for processing on graphical processing units."
