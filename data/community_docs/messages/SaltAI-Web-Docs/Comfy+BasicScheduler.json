        "question": "What is BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "BasicScheduler is a custom node in ComfyUI located in the sampling/custom_sampling/schedulers category, designed to calculate and adjust sigma values for a specified model and scheduler over a defined number of steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the BasicScheduler node play?",
        "answer": "The BasicScheduler node plays a foundational role in custom sampling strategies within ComfyUI, providing precise control over the diffusion process in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "The required input types for BasicScheduler include 'model', 'scheduler', 'steps', and optionally 'denoise', each with specific ComfyUI and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'model' input affect BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input specifies the model for which sigma values are calculated, influencing the behavior of the diffusion process managed by BasicScheduler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'scheduler' input in BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' input defines the scheduler used to calculate sigma values, directly impacting the granularity and execution of diffusion steps within BasicScheduler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'denoise' parameter function in BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' parameter in BasicScheduler adjusts the effective number of steps based on denoising level, offering finer control over the diffusion process by refining the sigma values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of BasicScheduler?",
        "answer": "The output type of BasicScheduler is 'sigmas', which provides the calculated sigma values crucial for controlling the diffusion process in generative models, represented as a torch.FloatTensor."
