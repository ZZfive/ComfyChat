        "question": "What is Image Resize Factor (mtb) in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Image Resize Factor (mtb) is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to resize images based on a specified scaling factor, optionally applying supersampling for higher quality resizing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Resize Factor (mtb) node belongs to the category `mtb/image` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is required for the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node to work?",
        "answer": "The Image Resize Factor (mtb) node requires an input image tensor of dtype `IMAGE` and data type `torch.Tensor` to function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input in the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node control?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node controls the scaling factor to resize the image by, determining the new dimensions of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'supersample' input affect the output of the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'supersample' input is a boolean flag that, when set to True, applies supersampling during resizing for enhanced image quality in the output of the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resampling' input in the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'resampling' input in the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node specifies the method of resampling to use when resizing the image, which affects the quality and characteristics of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there an optional input in the Image Resize Factor (mtb) node, and what does it do?",
        "answer": "The Image Resize Factor (mtb) node has an optional 'mask' input, which, if provided, is used during resizing and resized to match the dimensions of the output image tensor."
