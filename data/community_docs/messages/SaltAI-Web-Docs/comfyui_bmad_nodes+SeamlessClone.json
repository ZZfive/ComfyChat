        "question": "What is the SeamlessClone node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeamlessClone node in ComfyUI is used for blending two images together seamlessly, utilizing a mask to define the blending region and various cloning modes for control over the blending behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which cloning modes does the SeamlessClone node support?",
        "answer": "The SeamlessClone node supports normal cloning, mixed cloning, and monochrome transfer as cloning modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `src_mask` input in the SeamlessClone node?",
        "answer": "The `src_mask` input in the SeamlessClone node defines the region of the source image that will be cloned. Only the parts of the source image covered by the mask are cloned onto the destination image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the `cx` and `cy` coordinates affect the result of the SeamlessClone operation?",
        "answer": "The `cx` and `cy` coordinates in the SeamlessClone node determine the center of the destination point for cloning, influencing the positioning of the cloned region on the destination image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `dst`, `src`, and `src_mask` inputs of the SeamlessClone node accept?",
        "answer": "The `dst`, `src`, and `src_mask` inputs of the SeamlessClone node accept `IMAGE` data, which is internally represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SeamlessClone node categorized under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeamlessClone node is categorized under `Bmad/CV/C.Photography` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SeamlessClone node provide?",
        "answer": "The SeamlessClone node provides an `IMAGE` output, which is the result of the seamless cloning operation, as a `torch.Tensor`."
