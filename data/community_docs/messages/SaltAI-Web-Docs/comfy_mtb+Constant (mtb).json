        "question": "What is the purpose of the Constant (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Constant (mtb) node is designed to output a constant value, serving as a utility within a graph to provide a fixed value that can be used as input to other nodes, facilitating the creation of static or dynamic flows based on predefined constants."
    },
    {
        "question": "What categories does the Constant (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Constant (mtb) node belongs to the 'mtb/utils' category in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter for the Constant (mtb) node and how is it used?",
        "answer": "The input parameter for the Constant (mtb) node is 'Value', which represents the constant value to be output by the node. This parameter is essential for defining the static data that will be passed through the graph, affecting subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Constant (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Constant (mtb) node is the constant value defined by the input parameter, which is passed through the graph for use in subsequent nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy and Python dtypes accepted as input and output by the Constant (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Constant (mtb) node accepts 'str | int | float | dict | list | bool | None' as input and output Comfy and Python dtypes, including strings, integers, floats, dictionaries, lists, booleans, and None."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name used to define the Constant (mtb) node in the source code?",
        "answer": "The class name used to define the Constant (mtb) node in the source code is 'MTB_Constant'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Constant (mtb) node execute and what does it return?",
        "answer": "The Constant (mtb) node executes by receiving the 'Value' parameter and returns this value as the output through its 'output' port."
