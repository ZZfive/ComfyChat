    {
        "question": "What parameter controls the enhancement of details in the upscaled image produced by the SeargeHighResolution node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'hires_detail_boost' adjusts the intensity of detail enhancement applied to the upscaled image by the SeargeHighResolution node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the scaling factor for upscaling the image in the SeargeHighResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'hires_scale' input determines the scaling factor for upscaling the image in the SeargeHighResolution node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is 'hires_mode' in the SeargeHighResolution node?",
        "answer": "The 'hires_mode' input is a required input in the SeargeHighResolution node, specifying the high-resolution mode to be used, with a Comfy dtype of 'COMBO[STRING]' and Python dtype of 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the SeargeHighResolution node is used for specifying the target size for the final upscaled image?",
        "answer": "The 'final_upscale_size' input is used for specifying the target size for the final upscaled image in the SeargeHighResolution node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeHighResolution node handle the contrast of the upscaled image?",
        "answer": "The SeargeHighResolution node modifies the contrast of the upscaled image through the 'hires_contrast_factor' input, enhancing visual depth and definition."
