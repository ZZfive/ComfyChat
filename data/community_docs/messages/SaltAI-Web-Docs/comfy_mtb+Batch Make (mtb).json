        "question": "What is the Batch Make (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Batch Make (mtb) is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to create batches from individual data points or smaller batches, optimizing data handling and processing efficiency, especially for large datasets or operations that benefit from batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does Batch Make (mtb) belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Batch Make (mtb) belongs to the 'mtb/batch' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Batch Make (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Batch Make (mtb) node are `image` and `count`. `image` is used for specifying images to be batched together, and `count` specifies the number of images or data points to include in each batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input type represent in Batch Make (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The `image` input type in Batch Make (mtb) represents images to be batched together, essential for the batch creation process for visual data. This input type has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `count` input in Batch Make (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The `count` input in Batch Make (mtb) specifies the number of images or data points to include in each batch, directly affecting the size and composition of the created batches. It has a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does Batch Make (mtb) output?",
        "answer": "Batch Make (mtb) outputs batches of images, represented with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `List[torch.Tensor]`. These batches are ready for further processing or analysis in downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the common infrastructure type for the Batch Make (mtb) functionality?",
        "answer": "The common infrastructure type for the Batch Make (mtb) functionality is `CPU`."
