        "question": "What is the ImpactDilateMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDilateMask node is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to modify the spatial dimensions of a mask by applying dilation or erosion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactDilateMask node belong to?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDilateMask node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the 'mask' input in the ImpactDilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the ImpactDilateMask node represents the input mask that is to be dilated or eroded, which is crucial for defining the area to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactDilateMask node use the 'dilation' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' parameter in the ImpactDilateMask node specifies the degree of dilation or erosion to apply to the mask; positive values cause dilation (expansion), while negative values lead to erosion (contraction)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactDilateMask node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactDilateMask node is 'mask', representing a modified mask with adjusted boundaries, dilated or eroded based on the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for using the ImpactDilateMask node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the ImpactDilateMask node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a recommended common node for use alongside the ImpactDilateMask node?",
        "answer": "A recommended common node for use alongside the ImpactDilateMask node is the 'Mask Threshold Region' node."
