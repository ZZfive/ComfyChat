        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactSEGSConcat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSConcat node in ComfyUI is designed to concatenate multiple segmentation data structures (SEGS) into a single SEGS structure, ensuring all segments have the same dimensions for successful concatenation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the ImpactSEGSConcat node require?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSConcat node requires the input of 'segs1', which represents the first set of segmentation data structures to be concatenated, ensuring they share the same dimensions for successful concatenation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactSEGSConcat node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactSEGSConcat node is a single SEGS data structure named 'segs', which combines the input SEGS structures, ensuring they share the same dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the ImpactSEGSConcat node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSConcat node can be found in the category 'ImpactPack/Util' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactSEGSConcat node handle segments with different dimensions?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSConcat node handles segments with different dimensions by ignoring those segments that are incompatible with the dimensions of the first segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the ImpactSEGSConcat node does not find compatible segments?",
        "answer": "If the ImpactSEGSConcat node does not find compatible segments, it returns an empty SEGS data structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ImpactSEGSConcat node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ImpactSEGSConcat node is 'CPU'."
