        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT node is designed for editing and manipulating segmentation elements (SEG_ELT) within the ImpactPack framework, enabling precise control over the segmentation output by modifying properties such as bounding boxes or applying transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the 'seg_elt' parameter in ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT represent?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_elt' parameter represents the segmentation element (SEG_ELT) to be edited, serving as the target segmentation element whose properties are to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional parameters can be used to alter the image associated with a segmentation element in ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT?",
        "answer": "The 'cropped_image_opt' parameter can be used to provide an alternative cropped image for the segmentation element."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input controls the bounding box of a segmentation element in ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox_opt' parameter allows for providing an alternative bounding box for the segmentation element."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can an alternative mask be provided for a segmentation element when using ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT?",
        "answer": "An alternative cropped mask for the segmentation element can be provided through the 'cropped_mask_opt' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter affects the confidence level of a segmentation element in ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT?",
        "answer": "The 'confidence_opt' parameter specifies the confidence level of the segmentation element, which affects its processing and interpretation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT node after applying edits?",
        "answer": "The ImpactEdit_SEG_ELT node returns a modified segmentation element (SEG_ELT) after applying specified edits, such as adjusting its bounding box."
