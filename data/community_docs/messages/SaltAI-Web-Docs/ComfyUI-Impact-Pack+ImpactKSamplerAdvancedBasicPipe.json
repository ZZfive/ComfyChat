        "question": "What is the ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe node is an advanced version of the KSampler within a pipeline in ComfyUI, designed to facilitate complex sampling processes by integrating additional configurations and options for more nuanced control over the sampling outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required for the 'basic_pipe' in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'basic_pipe' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe requires a configuration that includes model and initial settings, with a Comfy dtype of BASIC_PIPE and a Python dtype of tuple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'add_noise' input control in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe controls whether noise should be added to the sampling process, acting as a boolean input that enables or disables this feature."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noise_seed' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_seed' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe specifies the seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility in the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'sampler_name' input utilized in the ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe determines the specific sampler algorithm to be used, allowing for customization of the sampling process with a selection of sampler names provided as a combo list of strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe provide?",
        "answer": "ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe provides outputs including the basic pipeline configuration after the sampling process (BASIC_PIPE), the resulting latent image after the sampling process (LATENT), and the VAE model used in the sampling process (VAE)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cfg' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' input in ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe specifies the configuration setting for the sampling process, impacting the behavior and outcome of the sampler with a float input ranging from 0.0 to 100.0."
