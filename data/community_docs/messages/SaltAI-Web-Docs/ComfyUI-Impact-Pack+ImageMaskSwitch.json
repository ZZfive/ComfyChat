        "question": "What is the ImageMaskSwitch node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImageMaskSwitch node in ComfyUI is used for the selection and output of a specific image and its associated mask from a set of up to four image-mask pairs based on a selection input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImageMaskSwitch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageMaskSwitch node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the select parameter in ImageMaskSwitch determine the image-mask pair to output?",
        "answer": "The select parameter in ImageMaskSwitch determines which image-mask pair to output by allowing dynamic selection from up to four options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of input does ImageMaskSwitch require or allow to function properly?",
        "answer": "ImageMaskSwitch requires the select parameter and the first image (images1) as input. It optionally allows three more images (images2_opt, images3_opt, images4_opt) and their corresponding masks (mask1_opt, mask2_opt, mask3_opt, mask4_opt)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageMaskSwitch node and in what format?",
        "answer": "The ImageMaskSwitch node outputs the selected image based on the input selection and the mask associated with the selected image, if provided, in torch.Tensor format for both image and mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of image-mask pairs that can be selected from using ImageMaskSwitch?",
        "answer": "The ImageMaskSwitch node allows for the selection from up to four image-mask pairs."

    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the mask associated with an image in ImageMaskSwitch?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the mask associated with an image in ImageMaskSwitch is MASK, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
