    {
        "question": "What is the 'audio' parameter in the SaltAudioRepeat node?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' parameter is the raw audio data to be processed, serving as the base audio clip that will be repeated according to the 'repeat_times' parameter, with a comfy dtype of `AUDIO` and a Python dtype of `bytes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'repeat_times' parameter play in the SaltAudioRepeat node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeat_times' parameter specifies how many times the audio clip should be repeated, directly influencing the length of the resulting audio output. It has a comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the SaltAudioRepeat node produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioRepeat node outputs audio data, with a type of `AUDIO`, after being repeated the specified number of times, effectively extending its duration."
