        "question": "What is the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to perform multiplication between an integer and a floating-point number, producing both integer and floating-point results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float (JPS) node requires two input types: `int_a`, which represents the integer value to be multiplied, and `float_b`, representing the floating-point number to be multiplied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `int_a` in the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "`int_a` in the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node represents the integer value to be multiplied. It determines the scale of the multiplication operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Multiply Int Float (JPS) node has two output types: `int_multiply`, which is the integer result of the multiplication, and `float_multiply`, which is the floating-point result providing a precise outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `float_b` input in the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "`float_b` in the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node allows for fractional scaling in the multiplication process, as it represents the floating-point number to be multiplied with the integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the `Math_Multiply_INT_FLOAT` node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the `Math_Multiply_INT_FLOAT` node is not an output node in ComfyUI. It is used for performing the multiplication between an integer and a floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `Math_Multiply_INT_FLOAT` class in ComfyUI's Multiply Int Float (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `Math_Multiply_INT_FLOAT` class in the Multiply Int Float (JPS) node is responsible for the multiplication operation between `int_a` and `float_b`, and it returns the integer and floating-point results of the multiplication."
