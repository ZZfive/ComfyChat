        "question": "What category does LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup belong to?",
        "answer": "LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup belongs to the category 'Adv-ControlNet 🛂🅐🅒🅝/keyframes' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup enable?",
        "answer": "LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup enables the creation, interpolation, and management of keyframes based on specified strengths and batch indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup include 'float_strengths', which specifies the strengths for each keyframe in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prev_latent_kf' parameter do?",
        "answer": "The 'prev_latent_kf' parameter allows for the inclusion of previously generated latent keyframes, which can be merged with the newly generated or manipulated batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type does LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup return?",
        "answer": "LatentKeyframeBatchedGroup returns a LatentKeyframeGroup object containing the batch of generated or manipulated latent keyframes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does setting 'print_keyframes' to True do?",
        "answer": "Setting 'print_keyframes' to True enables logging information about each keyframe in the batch, including its batch index and strength."
