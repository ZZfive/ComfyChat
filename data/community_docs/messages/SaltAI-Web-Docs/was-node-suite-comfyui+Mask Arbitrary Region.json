        "question": "What is the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node in ComfyUI is designed to process image masks by applying an arbitrary region masking technique, adjusting the regions within the masks based on specified size and threshold parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node are 'masks', which should be of dtype 'MASK', and 'size' and 'threshold', both of dtype 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node process the input masks?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node processes the input masks by adjusting them to focus on arbitrary regions based on the given size and threshold, effectively altering the mask's focus or coverage area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node produce?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node produces 'MASKS', which are processed masks with arbitrary regions applied, reflecting the specified size and threshold adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters determine the scale and selection of the region to be highlighted in the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node?",
        "answer": "The scale of the region to be highlighted in the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node is determined by the 'size' parameter, and the selection is controlled by the 'threshold' parameter, which affects the mask's detail level and the region's prominence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the inference device type for the 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Arbitrary Region' node in ComfyUI uses the 'GPU' as its inference device type."
