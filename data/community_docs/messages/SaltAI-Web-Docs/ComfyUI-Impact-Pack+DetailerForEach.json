        "question": "What is the purpose of the DetailerForEach node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DetailerForEach node in ComfyUI is designed to iterate over a collection of items, applying detailed analysis or transformations to each item individually to enhance the granularity of the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of DetailerForEach in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "DetailerForEach belongs to the category 'ImpactPack/Detailer' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'image' input in DetailerForEach?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input is essential for operations that involve visual data, allowing the DetailerForEach node to apply transformations or analyses directly to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is DetailerForEach an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, DetailerForEach is not an output node as specified by the attribute 'Output node: False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy and Python dtype for the 'image' input in DetailerForEach?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'image' input is `IMAGE`, and the Python dtype is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DetailerForEach node ensure that each image is processed with a focus on its specific characteristics?",
        "answer": "The DetailerForEach node ensures focused processing by iterating over a collection of items and applying detailed analysis or transformations tailored to each item's characteristics or requirements individually."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the computational model to be used for processing in DetailerForEach?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input determines the computational model to be used for processing in DetailerForEach."
