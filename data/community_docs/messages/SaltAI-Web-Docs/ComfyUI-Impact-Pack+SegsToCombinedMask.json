        "question": "What is the SegsToCombinedMask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SegsToCombinedMask is a node in ComfyUI used to transform a collection of segmented objects into a single, combined mask, merging individual segment masks into a unified representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs does the 'segs' parameter expect in the SegsToCombinedMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter in the SegsToCombinedMask node expects a collection of segmented objects with a comfortable dtype of 'SEGS' and a Python dtype of List[SEG]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of SegsToCombinedMask represented in Python?",
        "answer": "The output of the SegsToCombinedMask node is represented as a 'torch.Tensor' in Python, specifically a tensor representation of the combined mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SegsToCombinedMask node produce?",
        "answer": "The SegsToCombinedMask node produces a combined mask (dtype MASK) from input segments (segs), merging multiple segment masks into a single unified mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operation is performed by the SegsToCombinedMask node to generate the output?",
        "answer": "The SegsToCombinedMask node performs the operation of merging individual segment masks into a unified mask representation."
