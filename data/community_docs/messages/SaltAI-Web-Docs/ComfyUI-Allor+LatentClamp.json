        "question": "What is LatentClamp?",
        "answer": "LatentClamp is a node in ComfyUI designed to pass through latent representations without modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of LatentClamp?",
        "answer": "The class name of LatentClamp is `LatentClamp`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does LatentClamp belong to?",
        "answer": "LatentClamp belongs to the `clamp` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does LatentClamp return as output?",
        "answer": "LatentClamp returns the unaltered latent data structure as output, ensuring continuity in processing pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data structure does LatentClamp preserve?",
        "answer": "LatentClamp preserves the 'latent' data structure, which is crucial for maintaining integrity in data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentClamp handle the 'latent' parameter?",
        "answer": "LatentClamp handles the 'latent' parameter as a Comfy dtype of `LATENT` and Python dtype of `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of LatentClamp in a pipeline?",
        "answer": "In a pipeline, LatentClamp serves as a checkpoint to ensure the preservation of latent representations for subsequent processing steps."
