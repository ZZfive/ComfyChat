        "question": "What does the Repeat Into Grid (image) node do?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (image) node tiles the input image samples into a grid of configurable dimensions, creating a larger, grid-like composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Repeat Into Grid (image) node belong?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (image) node belongs to the \"Bmad/image\" category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input represent in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node represents the input image to be tiled across the grid, determining the base image that will be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'image' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'image' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node is 'torch.Tensor' in Python and 'IMAGE' in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Repeat Into Grid (image) node handle the 'columns' input?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (image) node uses the 'columns' input to specify the number of columns in the grid, determining how many times the input image is repeated horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'rows' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'rows' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node is 'int' in Python and 'INT' in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rows' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'rows' input in the Repeat Into Grid (image) node determines the number of rows in the grid, specifying how many times the input image is repeated vertically."
