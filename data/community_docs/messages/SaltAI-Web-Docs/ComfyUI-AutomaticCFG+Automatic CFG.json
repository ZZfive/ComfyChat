        "question": "What is the Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI is a custom node designed to apply a dynamic configuration to models, enhancing their performance by adjusting parameters based on the 'boost' flag."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node requires two input types: `model` which represents the model to which the dynamic configuration will be applied, and `boost` which determines the intensity of the configuration adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Automatic CFG node adjust model parameters?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node adjusts model parameters based on the 'boost' flag, applying a more aggressive optimization strategy when 'boost' is enabled, potentially leading to significant enhancements in model performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Automatic CFG node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Automatic CFG node is a modified version of the input model, optimized through dynamic configuration adjustments for improved performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'boost' parameter in the Automatic CFG node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost' parameter in the Automatic CFG node determines the intensity of the configuration adjustments. Enabling 'boost' applies a more aggressive optimization strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node in ComfyUI is implemented by the `simpleDynamicCFG` class."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure does the Automatic CFG node support?",
        "answer": "The Automatic CFG node supports the CPU infrastructure."
