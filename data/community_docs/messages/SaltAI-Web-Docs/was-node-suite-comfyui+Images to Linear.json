        "question": "What does the node 'Images to Linear' do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to Linear' node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a batch of images to a linear (grayscale) color space, processing each image and concatenating the results into a single tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Images to Linear' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to Linear' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of converting images to a linear color space using the 'Images to Linear' node?",
        "answer": "Converting images to a linear color space using the 'Images to Linear' node simplifies further processing or analysis, making it useful for tasks that require uniformity in color space across multiple images, such as certain types of image analysis or preprocessing for machine learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the 'Images to Linear' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to Linear' node provides an output of type 'image' that is a tensor containing the batch of images converted to grayscale, with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' parameter represent in the 'Images to Linear' node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the 'Images to Linear' node represents a batch of images that will be converted to grayscale. It is crucial for tasks that benefit from or require image data in a linear color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Images to Linear' node handle the conversion of individual images in a batch?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to Linear' node processes each image in the input batch individually by converting it from its original color space to grayscale, and then concatenates the results into a single tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the 'Images to Linear' node designed to run on?",
        "answer": "The 'Images to Linear' node is designed to run on GPU infrastructure type."
