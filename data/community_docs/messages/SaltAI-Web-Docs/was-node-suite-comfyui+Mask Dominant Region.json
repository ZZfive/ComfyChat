        "question": "What is the 'Mask Dominant Region' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Dominant Region' node in ComfyUI is used to identify and isolate the dominant region within a given set of masks based on a specified threshold, effectively filtering out less significant areas and focusing on the most prominent region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Mask Dominant Region' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Dominant Region' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'threshold' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node determines the cutoff intensity for considering a region as dominant, playing a key role in distinguishing between significant and insignificant areas within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'masks' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node require?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node requires masks data with a Comfy dtype of 'MASK' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'Mask Dominant Region' node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'Mask Dominant Region' node is masks with the dominant region highlighted, effectively isolating the most significant area from the rest of the image, with a Comfy dtype of 'MASK' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the 'threshold' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node?",
        "answer": "The default value of the 'threshold' input in the 'Mask Dominant Region' node is 128."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is suitable for running the 'Mask Dominant Region' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Dominant Region' node is suitable for running on GPU infrastructure."
