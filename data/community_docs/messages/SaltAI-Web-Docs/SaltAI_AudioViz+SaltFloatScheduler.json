        "question": "What is the `SaltFloatScheduler` and what is it used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `SaltFloatScheduler` is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for creating and managing float schedules, which are sequences of floating-point values used to control various parameters over time in audio-visual projects. It enables precise scheduling of values and dynamic adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `repeat_sequence_times` input do in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The `repeat_sequence_times` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node specifies the number of times the float sequence should be repeated, effectively extending the length of the schedule by duplicating the initial sequence a given number of times."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `curves_mode` input affect the float schedules created?",
        "answer": "The `curves_mode` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` determines the mode of curve application for the float schedule, which can affect the shape and progression of the floating-point values in the sequence. It allows for different easing functions to be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `use_perlin_tremors` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The `use_perlin_tremors` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node is used to indicate whether Perlin noise should be applied to the float schedule, generating smooth, natural variations in the values to add details and subtle randomness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `tremor_scale` input control in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The `tremor_scale` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node controls the scale of the Perlin tremors applied, which in turn influences the frequency of the noise effect on the sequence of values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `tremor_octaves` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The `tremor_octaves` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` specifies the number of octaves for the Perlin noise used to tremor the sequence, affecting the detail level of the variations generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `tremor_persistence` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` impact the float schedules?",
        "answer": "The `tremor_persistence` input in the `SaltFloatScheduler` determines the persistence of the Perlin noise applied, which influences the amplitude of the noise at each octave, impacting the intensity of the variations."
