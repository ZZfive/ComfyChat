        "question": "What is the 'Image Bloom Filter' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Bloom Filter' node in ComfyUI is used to apply a bloom filter effect to an image, enhancing its visual appeal by simulating the perception of extreme brightness in the human eye. This effect blurs the bright areas and adds them back to the original image, creating a glow around bright spots."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Image Bloom Filter' node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Bloom Filter' node falls under the 'WAS Suite/Image/Filter' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type does the 'Image Bloom Filter' node use to receive the subject image?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Bloom Filter' node uses the 'image' input type to receive the subject image that the bloom filter effect will be applied to. This input is of the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and the Python dtype 'PIL.Image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius' input of the 'Image Bloom Filter' node affect the image output?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' input in the 'Image Bloom Filter' node defines the radius for the Gaussian blur applied during the bloom filter effect creation. It influences the spread and intensity of the bloom effect around the bright areas of the image, thus affecting the final image appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'intensity' input in the 'Image Bloom Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity' input in the 'Image Bloom Filter' node acts as a multiplier for the bloom effect's intensity. It controls how much the bloom effect contributes to the final image, allowing for the fine-tuning of the glow strength around bright spots."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used to apply a glow around bright spots in an image?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Bloom Filter' node can be used to apply a glow around bright spots in an image by enhanced brightness through the bloom filter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'Image Bloom Filter' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'Image Bloom Filter' node in ComfyUI is 'IMAGE', representing the final image after applying the bloom filter effect, showcasing enhanced brightness and a glowing effect around bright areas."
