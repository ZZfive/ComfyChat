        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Batch Images From List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Batch Images From List node is designed to transform a list of images into a batched format, facilitating operations that require batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CR Batch Images From List node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Batch Images From List node belongs to the category `üß© Comfyroll Studio/‚ú® Essential/üìú List/üõ†Ô∏è Utils`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the CR Batch Images From List node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the CR Batch Images From List node is `image_list`, which is a list of images crucial for the node's operation as it directly influences the creation of the batched images output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Batch Images From List node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR Batch Images From List node are `image_batch` and `show_help`. `image_batch` is the batched format of the input images, and `show_help` is a URL providing additional help on list-related operations within the ComfyUI ecosystem."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the `image_list` input correspond to in the CR Batch Images From List node?",
        "answer": "The `image_list` input in the CR Batch Images From List node corresponds to the Python data type `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the batched images output created by the CR Batch Images From List node?",
        "answer": "The CR Batch Images From List node creates the batched images output by using the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the list of images along the first dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Batch Images From List node do if the image list input has one image or less?",
        "answer": "If the image list input has one image or less, the CR Batch Images From List node will return the image list as it is without any concatenation."
