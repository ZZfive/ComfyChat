        "question": "What is the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VideoLinearCFGGuidance node in ComfyUI is used to apply a linear conditioning guidance scale to a video model, allowing for dynamic control over the generation process and fine-tuning of the output based on the desired level of conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models can be modified by the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node?",
        "answer": "The VideoLinearCFGGuidance node can modify video models by applying a linear conditioning guidance scale, which adjusts the influence of conditioned and unconditioned components over a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VideoLinearCFGGuidance node outputs a modified model with the linear CFG guidance scale applied, represented by the dtype 'MODEL'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter specifies the minimum conditioning guidance scale in the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'min_cfg' in the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node specifies the minimum conditioning guidance scale, which is crucial for defining the lower bound of the guidance scale adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'model' input in the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node has a Python dtype of 'torch.nn.Module', representing the video model to which the linear CFG guidance will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used together with the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VideoLinearCFGGuidance node in ComfyUI can be used together with common nodes such as KSampler, FreeU_V2, and KSamplerAdvanced, which are often part of the model conditioning workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is required to use the VideoLinearCFGGuidance node efficiently?",
        "answer": "The VideoLinearCFGGuidance node in ComfyUI operates optimally with GPU infrastructure, which is designated as the infra type for this node."
