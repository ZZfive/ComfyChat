    {
        "question": "What class does ImageFilterStackBlur belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterStackBlur belongs to the class named `ImageFilterStackBlur`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageFilterStackBlur fall under?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterStackBlur falls under the category `image/filter`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by ImageFilterStackBlur?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by ImageFilterStackBlur is `images`, which are tensors representing the images to which the stack blur effect will be applied."

    {
        "question": "What does the size_x input determine in ImageFilterStackBlur?",
        "answer": "The `size_x` input in ImageFilterStackBlur determines the horizontal size of the blur effect, affecting the width of the area considered for blurring around each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the size_y input specify in ImageFilterStackBlur?",
        "answer": "The `size_y` input in ImageFilterStackBlur specifies the vertical size of the blur effect, influencing the height of the area considered for blurring around each pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ImageFilterStackBlur produce?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterStackBlur produces an output of type `IMAGE`, which is a tensor representing the resulting image after applying the stack blur effect."
