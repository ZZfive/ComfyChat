        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Smooth Region node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Smooth Region node in ComfyUI is designed to refine mask edges by applying a smoothing operation to specified regions within input masks, making them less jagged and more visually appealing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' input parameter represent in the Mask Smooth Region node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input parameter in the Mask Smooth Region node represents the input masks to be smoothed. This parameter is crucial for determining which areas of the image will undergo the smoothing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'sigma' parameter utilized in the Mask Smooth Region node?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma' parameter in the Mask Smooth Region node controls the smoothness level of the mask's edges. Higher values of 'sigma' result in smoother edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Mask Smooth Region node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Smooth Region node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Mask Smooth Region node in terms of its data type?",
        "answer": "The output of the Mask Smooth Region node is of the 'MASK' Comfy dtype, representing the smoothed masks with refined edges, and the Python dtype is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What hardware type is the Mask Smooth Region node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The Mask Smooth Region node is optimized for 'GPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with the Mask Smooth Region node in its source code?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the Mask Smooth Region node in its source code is 'WAS_Mask_Smooth_Region'."
