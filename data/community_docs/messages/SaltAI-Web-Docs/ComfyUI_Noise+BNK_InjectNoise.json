        "question": "What is the class name for the node that injects noise into latent representations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that injects noise into latent representations in ComfyUI is `BNK_InjectNoise`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the BNK_InjectNoise node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_InjectNoise node belongs to the `latent/noise` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for defining the base structure that the noise will modify in the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The primary latent representation, the `latents` input, is crucial for defining the base structure that the noise will modify in the InjectNoise node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `strength` parameter control in the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The `strength` parameter in the InjectNoise node controls the intensity of the noise applied to the latents, with higher values resulting in more pronounced noise effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `noise` input in the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The `noise` input in the InjectNoise node allows for the injection of custom noise into the latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the optional `mask` input utilized in the InjectNoise node?",
        "answer": "The optional `mask` input in the InjectNoise node can be applied to selectively introduce noise to specific areas of the latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the InjectNoise node output after performing the noise injection?",
        "answer": "The InjectNoise node outputs a modified latent representation after noise injection, potentially with selective application based on an optional mask."
