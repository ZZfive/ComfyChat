        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node in ComfyUI is designed to register a model as a LoRA hook, focusing on model-only modifications, to improve its adaptability and performance for specific tasks without affecting other components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node include `model` (dtype: MODEL), `ckpt_name` (dtype: COMBO[STRING]), and `strength_model` (dtype: FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` input represent in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The `model` input in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node represents the primary target model for the application of LoRA techniques, aiming to enhance its performance or adaptability for specific tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `ckpt_name` input in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` input in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node specifies the name of the checkpoint to apply LoRA configurations from, determining which set of LoRA adaptations to use for the customization of the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type `model` in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The `model` output type in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node represents the model after applying the specified LoRA adaptations, reflecting the enhanced or customized version of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the `lora_hook` output provide in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The `lora_hook` output in the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node provides a reference to the LoRA hook that has been integrated into the model, allowing access to the LoRA adaptations applied for further manipulation or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly node is `CPU`."
