        "question": "What is the RemapInsideParabolas node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "RemapInsideParabolas is a node in ComfyUI designed to perform a remapping operation based on the geometry of two parabolas within an image, adjusting the image's pixels to transform or correct the perspective or distortion in a way that aligns with these curves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the RemapInsideParabolas node is `RemapInsideParabolas`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the RemapInsideParabolas node fall?",
        "answer": "The RemapInsideParabolas node falls under the category `Bmad/CV/Transform`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is RemapInsideParabolas an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, RemapInsideParabolas is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the RemapInsideParabolas node is `dst_mask_with_i_parabolas`, specifying the destination mask that contains parabolas. This is crucial for determining the transformation's geometry and guiding the remapping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `dst_mask_with_i_parabolas` input use in the RemapInsideParabolas node?",
        "answer": "The `dst_mask_with_i_parabolas` input in the RemapInsideParabolas node uses a `MASK` data type with a Python dtype of `numpy.ndarray`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `remap` output from the RemapInsideParabolas node represent?",
        "answer": "The `remap` output from the RemapInsideParabolas node represents a transformed version of the input image, adjusted according to the geometry of the specified parabolas. It has a Comfy dtype of `REMAP` and a Python dtype of `Dict[str, Any]`."
