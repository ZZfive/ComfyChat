        "question": "What is the IF_ImagePrompt node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The IF_ImagePrompt node in ComfyUI is used to transform visual inputs into textual prompts, generating tailored text descriptions based on image characteristics and user profiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IF_ImagePrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IF_ImagePrompt node include an `image`, `image_prompt`, `base_ip`, `port`, `engine`, `selected_model`, `profile`, `embellish_prompt`, `style_prompt`, and `neg_prompt`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can translate images into descriptive texts?",
        "answer": "The IF_ImagePrompt node in ComfyUI can translate images into descriptive texts, leveraging user profiles and image characteristics to generate tailored text descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the IF_ImagePrompt node produce?",
        "answer": "The IF_ImagePrompt node produces three outputs: `Question`, `Response`, and `Negative`. These represent the initial image prompt or question, the main body of the generated text, and a segment addressing negative prompts respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IF_ImagePrompt node handle images of different input types?",
        "answer": "The IF_ImagePrompt node supports images in various formats including torch.Tensor, PIL.Image, or file paths, converting them as needed to process the generation of textual prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types does the IF_ImagePrompt node support?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the IF_ImagePrompt node include `max_tokens`, `seed`, a `random` flag, and a `keep_alive` flag, controlling aspects such as output length, randomness, and AI engine availability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `temperature` input in the IF_ImagePrompt node?",
        "answer": "The `temperature` input in the IF_ImagePrompt node controls the creativity of the AI's responses, affecting the variability and unpredictability of the generated text."
