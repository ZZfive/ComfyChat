        "question": "What is the ControlNetHadamard node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ControlNetHadamard is a custom node in ComfyUI used to apply a control network to a set of images and conditions, adjusting the conditions based on the control network's output and a specified strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetHadamard node falls under the 'Bmad/conditioning' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'conds' represent in the ControlNetHadamard node's input?",
        "answer": "The 'conds' input type in ControlNetHadamard represents the conditions to be applied to each image, which are modified by the control network to achieve the desired effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of 'image' in ControlNetHadamard for ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The data type of 'image' in ControlNetHadamard for ComfyUI is 'List[torch.Tensor]', representing the images to which the conditions are applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'strength' affect the output of the ControlNetHadamard node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input in ControlNetHadamard determines the intensity of the control network's effect on the conditions, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ControlNetHadamard generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ControlNetHadamard generates modified conditions ('conditioning') as output, reflecting the applied changes after being processed by the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for 'conds' input type in ControlNetHadamard?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for 'conds' input type in ControlNetHadamard is 'List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, Any]]]', representing the conditions to be applied to each image."
