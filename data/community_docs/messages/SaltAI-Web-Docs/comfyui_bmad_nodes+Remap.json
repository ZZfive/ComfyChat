        "question": "What is the class name of the node that performs remapping operations on images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that performs remapping operations on images in ComfyUI is `Remap`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is the `Remap` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Remap` node in ComfyUI is a node that falls under the category `Bmad/CV/Transform`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for defining how the image will be altered in the `Remap` node?",
        "answer": "The input `remap` is crucial for defining how the image will be altered in the `Remap` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the `Remap` node, what is the source image referred to as?",
        "answer": "The source image in the `Remap` node is referred to as `src`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `Remap` node handle optional masks for selective remapping?",
        "answer": "The `Remap` node handles optional masks for selective remapping through the `src_mask` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the `Remap` node output images with an alpha channel?",
        "answer": "Yes, the `Remap` node can output images with an alpha channel if the `output_with_alpha` input is set to `True`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the application of a custom function and a generic function in the `Remap` node's remapping process?",
        "answer": "In the `Remap` node's remapping process, a generic function uses `cv.remap` to apply the transformation, while a custom function can replace this with another function, such as for user-provided homography, without the need for a separate node."
