    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LMStudioPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LMStudioPrompt node include `input_prompt` for initial text, `mode` for operation mode, `custom_history` for additional context, `server_address` for host location, `server_port` for server communication, and `seed` for determinism in generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the LMStudioPrompt node is used to introduce determinism in the prompt generation?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to introduce determinism in the prompt generation process, ensuring that the same input produces the same output across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does LMStudioPrompt provide?",
        "answer": "LMStudioPrompt provides a `text` output type, which is the enhanced prompt generated by the node, ready for further processing or use."
