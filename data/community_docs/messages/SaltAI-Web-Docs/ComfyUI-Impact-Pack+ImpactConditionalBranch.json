        "question": "What is the ImpactConditionalBranch node in ComfyUI's ImpactPack?",
        "answer": "ImpactConditionalBranch is a node in the ImpactPack/Logic category of ComfyUI that provides conditional branching, allowing for the execution of different logic or values based on a given condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output of the ImpactConditionalBranch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactConditionalBranch node is determined by the evaluation of a condition. If the condition is True, the node returns the `tt_value`; if False, it returns the `ff_value`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImpactConditionalBranch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactConditionalBranch node are `cond` of type BOOLEAN, `tt_value` and `ff_value` which can be of any type (*)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines which value is output by the ImpactConditionalBranch node?",
        "answer": "The output value of the ImpactConditionalBranch node is determined by the condition `cond`; if it is True, the node outputs `tt_value`; if False, it outputs `ff_value`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of values can `tt_value` and `ff_value` in the ImpactConditionalBranch node hold?",
        "answer": "`tt_value` and `ff_value` in the ImpactConditionalBranch node can hold any type of value (*), allowing for flexible conditional output based on the condition `cond`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the condition evaluated in the ImpactConditionalBranch node?",
        "answer": "The condition is evaluated by the `cond` input, which is of type BOOLEAN; if `cond` is True, it returns `tt_value`, otherwise it returns `ff_value`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactConditionalBranch node in the context of ComfyUI project's workflow?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalBranch node serves as a fundamental building block for creating dynamic and conditional workflows within the ImpactPack of ComfyUI."
