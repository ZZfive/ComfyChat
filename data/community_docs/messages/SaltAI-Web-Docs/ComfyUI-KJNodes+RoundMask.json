        "question": "What is the purpose of the RoundMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a mask or a batch of masks into binary masks, effectively rounding the values to the nearest binary values (0 or 1) to ensure clear and distinct mask boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required by the RoundMask node?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node requires an input mask or a batch of masks with the comfy dtype `MASK` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor` to be rounded to binary values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the RoundMask node provide?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node outputs a binary mask or a batch of binary masks with pixel values rounded to the nearest binary value (0 or 1), and the output has the comfy dtype `MASK` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the RoundMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node can be found in the `KJNodes/masking` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operation does the RoundMask node perform on mask inputs?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node performs a rounding operation on the input mask or batch of masks to round the values to the nearest binary values (0 or 1) for clear, distinct mask boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the RoundMask node designed for use on CPU or GPU?",
        "answer": "The RoundMask node is designed for use on CPU according to its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with the RoundMask node in terms of source code?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the RoundMask node in terms of source code is `RoundMask`."
