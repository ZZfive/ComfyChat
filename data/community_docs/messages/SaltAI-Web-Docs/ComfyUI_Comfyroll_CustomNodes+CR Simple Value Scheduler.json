        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Simple Value Scheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Value Scheduler node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and apply simple value-based scheduling for animations, interpreting a given schedule and the current frame to output appropriate integer and floating-point values, facilitating dynamic adjustments throughout the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule' input represent in the CR Simple Value Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule' input in the CR Simple Value Scheduler represents the schedule string that defines keyframes and their corresponding values for the animation, serving as the blueprint for value transitions across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'current_frame' input in the CR Simple Value Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input in the CR Simple Value Scheduler specifies the current frame in the animation sequence, determining which value from the schedule should be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the CR Simple Value Scheduler provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Value Scheduler provides three types of output: 'INT' (integer value corresponding to the current frame's schedule), 'FLOAT' (floating-point value directly derived from the schedule), and 'show_help' (a URL providing additional help and documentation on using the CR Simple Value Scheduler)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Simple Value Scheduler handle an empty schedule string?",
        "answer": "If the schedule string is empty, the CR Simple Value Scheduler will print a warning message indicating that there are no lines in the schedule and will return no output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no schedule is found for a specific frame in the CR Simple Value Scheduler?",
        "answer": "If no schedule is found for a specific frame, the CR Simple Value Scheduler will print a warning message stating that no schedule was found for the frame and that simple schedules must start at frame 0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the CR Simple Value Scheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Value Scheduler node in ComfyUI requires two input types: 'schedule' (the schedule string defining keyframes and values for the animation) and 'current_frame' (specifying the current frame to determine which value from the schedule should be applied)."
