        "question": "What is the Masks Subtract node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Masks Subtract node in ComfyUI is designed to perform subtraction between two sets of masks, effectively removing parts of one mask using another. This operation is useful in image processing tasks where specific areas of interest need to be isolated or removed from an image mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Masks Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Masks Subtract node is 'MASKS', which, after subtracting 'masks_b' from 'masks_a', contains only the areas present in 'masks_a' but not in 'masks_b'. The Comfy dtype for this output is 'MASK', and the Python dtype is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks_a' input represent in the Masks Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks_a' input in the Masks Subtract node represents the first set of masks to be used in the subtraction operation. It plays a crucial role in determining the areas to be retained after the subtraction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks_b' input signify in the Masks Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks_b' input in the Masks Subtract node signifies the second set of masks to be subtracted from the first set. It determines the areas to be removed from the resulting mask after performing the subtraction operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly associated with the Masks Subtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "A commonly associated node with the Masks Subtract node in ComfyUI is the 'ToBinaryMask' node, which can be found in the 'ComfyUI-Impact-Pack'. This indicates that these nodes are often used together in various image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name defined in the source code of the Masks Subtract node?",
        "answer": "The function name defined in the source code of the Masks Subtract node is 'subtract_masks', which performs the actual mask subtraction operation when the class WAS_Mask_Subtract is initialized and the function is called."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the Masks Subtract node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for running the Masks Subtract node in ComfyUI is 'GPU', which suggests that the node is optimized for high-performance computation on graphic processing units."
