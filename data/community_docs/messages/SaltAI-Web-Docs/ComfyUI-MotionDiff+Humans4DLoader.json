        "question": "What is the Humans4DLoader node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Humans4DLoader node in ComfyUI is used to load and prepare 4D human models for tasks such as motion analysis or 3D reconstruction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Humans4DLoader node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Humans4DLoader node is a structured object, represented as a SimpleNamespace, containing the loaded 4D human model, its configuration, and the detector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `detector` input in the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The `detector` input specifies the detector model to be used for identifying humans in images, influencing the accuracy and performance of human detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the detector be customized when using the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the detector can be customized using the `detector` input, which allows you to choose from options like 'person_yolov8m-seg.pt', 'person_yolov8s-seg.pt', 'yolov8x.pt', and 'yolov9c.pt'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is half-precision floating-point format used in the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The `fp16` input in the Humans4DLoader node indicates whether the model should use half-precision floating-point format (FP16), which can improve performance on compatible hardware."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models are automatically downloaded when using the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "When using the Humans4DLoader node, models including the detector specified by the `detector` input, 'model_config.yaml', and 'epoch=35-step=1000000.ckpt' file are automatically downloaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the output of the Humans4DLoader node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the output of the Humans4DLoader node is SimpleNamespace, containing the 4D human model, configuration, and detector."
