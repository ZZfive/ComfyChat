        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPEncodeMultiple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPEncodeMultiple node is designed to encode multiple inputs using a CLIP model, producing a list of conditionings based on the inputs."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CLIPEncodeMultiple node are 'clip', which is the CLIP model used for encoding, and 'inputs_len', which specifies the number of inputs to be encoded."
