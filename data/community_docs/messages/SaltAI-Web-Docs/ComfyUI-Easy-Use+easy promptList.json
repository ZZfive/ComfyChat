        "question": "What is the function of the promptList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The promptList node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a list of strings based on a given multiline prompt, starting from a specified index and up to a maximum number of rows, facilitating the extraction and manipulation of text data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the promptList node?",
        "answer": "The promptList node accepts a required input `prompt_i` of unknown type as a Comfy dtype string and an optional input `optional_prompt_list`, which is a list of prompts that can be combined or processed separately."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the promptList node provide?",
        "answer": "The promptList node outputs a list of prompts as `prompt_list` and duplicates the output as `prompt_strings`, both of type `LIST` and `STRING` respectively in Comfy dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `optional_prompt_list` parameter in the promptList node?",
        "answer": "The `optional_prompt_list` parameter in the promptList node provides flexibility by allowing multiple prompts to be combined or processed separately, giving the user more control over input text sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the promptList node handle string inputs in the `run` function?",
        "answer": "In the `run` function of the promptList node, string inputs are processed by appending them to the prompts list, which is then returned as the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common usage tips for the promptList node?",
        "answer": "The common usage tips for the promptList node include specifying that the infra type is `CPU`, and there are no common nodes listed."

    {
        "question": "Does the promptList node output a list or a string?",
        "answer": "The promptList node outputs both a list and a string. It outputs a list of prompts as `prompt_list` and duplicates this output as `prompt_strings` for potential different uses or processing steps."
