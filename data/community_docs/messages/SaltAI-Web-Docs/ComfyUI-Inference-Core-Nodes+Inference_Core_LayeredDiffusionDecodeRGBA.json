        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node in ComfyUI is designed to decode the alpha channel from pixel values in images, converting RGB images to RGBA format by adding transparency information through a layered diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is responsible for enhancing the quality of images by adding transparency information in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node is responsible for enhancing the quality of images by adding transparency information through the decoding of the alpha channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input data types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node?",
        "answer": "The required input data types for the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node include 'samples' (Latent type), 'images' (Image type), 'sd_version' (Combo [String] type), and 'sub_batch_size' (INT type)."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node fall under?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node falls under the category of layer_diffuse in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sd_version' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node?",
        "answer": "The 'sd_version' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node specifies the version of the stable diffusion model to be used for decoding, impacting the quality of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node output, and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node outputs RGBA images, where the alpha channel has been decoded and added to the original RGB images. The output data type is IMAGE in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node process the input samples to decode the alpha channel?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeRGBA node processes the input samples to decode the alpha channel by leveraging a layered diffusion process, enhancing image quality by adding transparency information and converting RGB images to RGBA format."
