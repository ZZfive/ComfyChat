        "question": "What is the purpose of the StringSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StringSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and schedule string-based content for dynamic animation or content generation, facilitating the creation of animated text or evolving narratives through scheduling settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type represents the primary content to be scheduled and animated in the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The `text` input type represents the primary content to be scheduled and animated in the StringSchedule node, serving as the primary text based content for the scheduling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `max_frames` input specify in the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The `max_frames` input specifies the maximum number of frames for the scheduling process in the StringSchedule node, determining the length of the animation or content generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `print_output` input in the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The `print_output` input in the StringSchedule node is a boolean flag that, when true, enables the printing of the scheduling process's output for debugging or tracking purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the StringSchedule node are `POS` and `NEG`, both of type `STRING`, representing the positive and negative aspects of the text, respectively, and they are dynamically scheduled strings adjusted according to the current frame and scheduling settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `pre_text` input affect the scheduling result in the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The `pre_text` input in the StringSchedule node is an optional string that, when provided, is prepended to the main text before scheduling begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `pw_a`, `pw_b`, `pw_c`, and `pw_d` in the StringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "`pw_a`, `pw_b`, `pw_c`, and `pw_d` in the StringSchedule node are parameter weights used in the scheduling algorithm to adjust and fine-tune the influence of certain aspects of the text on the scheduling algorithm."
