        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Apply Multi Upscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Apply Multi Upscale node in ComfyUI is designed to apply multiple upscaling models sequentially to an image, enhancing its resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CR Apply Multi Upscale node belong to in ComfyUI's node library?",
        "answer": "The CR Apply Multi Upscale node belongs to the category `üß© Comfyroll Studio/‚ú® Essential/üîç Upscale` in ComfyUI's node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input `image` in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node used for?",
        "answer": "The input `image` in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node serves as the base for the sequential application of multiple upscaling models, each potentially enhancing the image's resolution further."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `resampling_method` input control in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The `resampling_method` input in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node specifies the method used for resampling during the upscaling process, affecting the quality and characteristics of the upscaled image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the CR Apply Multi Upscale node determines whether supersampling is applied during the upscaling process?",
        "answer": "The `supersample` input of the CR Apply Multi Upscale node determines whether supersampling is applied during the upscaling process, which can enhance the quality of the upscaled image by reducing aliasing effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the `upscale_stack` input in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the `upscale_stack` input in the CR Apply Multi Upscale node is `List[Tuple[str, float]]` in Python, representing a list of tuples where each tuple contains an upscaling model and a rescale factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CR Apply Multi Upscale node and its dtype?",
        "answer": "The output of the CR Apply Multi Upscale node is the upscaled image with dtype `IMAGE`, represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
