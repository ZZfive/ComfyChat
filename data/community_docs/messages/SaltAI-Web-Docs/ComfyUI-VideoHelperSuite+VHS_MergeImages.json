        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used for merging multiple sets of images?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeImages node is used in ComfyUI for merging multiple sets of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the VHS_MergeImages node require for the first set of images?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeImages node requires `images_A` as the first set of images, which serves as either the template for merging or is adjusted to match the dimensions of the second set."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input data does `images_A` require?",
        "answer": "`images_A` requires input data of type `Tensor` with dtype `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VHS_MergeImages node adjust dimensions between two image sets during the merge process?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeImages node adjusts dimensions by selecting the larger or smaller set, or explicitly choosing one set's dimensions to match, along with offering scaling and cropping options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What merge strategy options does the VHS_MergeImages node offer?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeImages node offers merge strategy options including matching to the first set, the second set, the smaller or larger dimensions among them, which are selected through the `merge_strategy` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the VHS_MergeImages node provide?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeImages node provides the resulting set of merged images with dtype `IMAGE` and the total number of images in the merged set with dtype `INT`."
