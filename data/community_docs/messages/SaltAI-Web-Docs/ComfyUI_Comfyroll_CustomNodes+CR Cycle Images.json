        "question": "What is the CR Cycle Images node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Images node in ComfyUI is designed to cycle through a sequence of images based on specified parameters, allowing for the creation of animations or slideshows with dynamic visual experiences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input in the CR Cycle Images node control?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the CR Cycle Images node specifies the cycling mode, determining how images are selected during animation. In 'Sequential' mode, images are cycled through in the order they are provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'image_list' input utilized in the CR Cycle Images node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_list' input in the CR Cycle Images node is a list of images to be cycled through. Each item in the list represents an image and its associated parameters, enabling the creation of complex animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'frame_interval' input play in the CR Cycle Images node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' input in the CR Cycle Images node controls the interval between frames, which influences the speed of the animation. A lower value results in a faster animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'loops' input affect the CR Cycle Images node's functionality?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' input in the CR Cycle Images node determines how many times the sequence of images is repeated. This allows for continuous animations by specifying the number of loops."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the CR Cycle Images node, how is the current image to be displayed calculated?",
        "answer": "The current image to be displayed in the CR Cycle Images node changes over time as the animation progresses, based on the cycling logic that takes into account the current frame number and frame interval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output in the CR Cycle Images node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output in the CR Cycle Images node is a URL to a help page that offers additional information and guidance on how to use the node effectively."
