        "question": "What is the Pixel Deflicker node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Deflicker node is designed to reduce flickering in sequences of images, enhancing visual consistency across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Pixel Deflicker node are `images`, `window_size`, `blending_strength`, and `batch_size`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of adjusting the `window_size` parameter in the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the `window_size` parameter impacts the extent of flicker reduction across frames by specifying the size of the window used for temporal smoothing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `blending_strength` parameter work in the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The `blending_strength` parameter controls the intensity of blending between original and smoothed frames, allowing for fine-tuning of the flicker mitigation effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Pixel Deflicker node is an IMAGE tensor containing the batch of images after flicker reduction, showcasing enhanced visual consistency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `batch_size` parameter determine in the Pixel Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of images processed at a time, impacting the node's execution efficiency."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used for flicker reduction in image sequences?",
        "answer": "The Pixel Deflicker node in the SuperBeastsAI/Animation category can be used for flicker reduction in image sequences."
