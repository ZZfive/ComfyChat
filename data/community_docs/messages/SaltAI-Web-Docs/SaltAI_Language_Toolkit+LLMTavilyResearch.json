        "question": "What is the LLMTavilyResearch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMTavilyResearch node in ComfyUI is designed to leverage advanced language models for conducting in-depth research and analysis by processing and interpreting large volumes of text data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMTavilyResearch node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMTavilyResearch node include `tavily_api_key` and `search_query`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `tavily_api_key` input expect in the LLMTavilyResearch node?",
        "answer": "The `tavily_api_key` input in the LLMTavilyResearch node expects a string data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the LLMTavilyResearch node provide?",
        "answer": "The LLMTavilyResearch node provides two outputs: `documents`, which is processed text data structured and analyzed for insights, and `urls`, a collection of URLs referenced or extracted during the research process."
    },
