        "question": "What is the CR Latent Batch Size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Latent Batch Size is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the batch size of latent representations by replicating the input samples to match the specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category of Comfyroll Studio can the CR Latent Batch Size node be found?",
        "answer": "The CR Latent Batch Size node can be found in the 'ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/âœ¨ Essential/ðŸ“¦ Core' category of Comfyroll Studio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'latent' input in the CR Latent Batch Size node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' input in the CR Latent Batch Size node is the latent representation of data, typically a tensor, that is to be adjusted in terms of batch size. It is crucial for determining the structure and content of the data to be replicated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the desired batch size in the CR Latent Batch Size node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' input, an integer, specifies the desired batch size in the CR Latent Batch Size node. It dictates how many times the input samples are replicated to achieve the specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CR Latent Batch Size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the CR Latent Batch Size node is a latent representation with the adjusted batch size, achieved by replicating the input samples as specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of infrastructure does the CR Latent Batch Size node run?",
        "answer": "The CR Latent Batch Size node in ComfyUI runs on GPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum value for the 'batch_size' input in the CR Latent Batch Size node?",
        "answer": "The maximum value for the 'batch_size' input in the CR Latent Batch Size node is 999."
