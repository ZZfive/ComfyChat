        "question": "What is the Deflicker node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Deflicker node in ComfyUI is designed to mitigate flickering in image sequences by adjusting the brightness of individual images based on the average brightness of their surrounding context, enhancing the visual quality of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used for flicker reduction in image sequences in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Deflicker node, provided by the SuperBeasts.AI extension, is used for flicker reduction in image sequences in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Deflicker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Deflicker node in ComfyUI include `images`, `context_length`, `brightness_threshold`, `blending_strength`, `noise_reduction_strength`, `gradient_smoothing_strength`, and `batch_size`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific function does the Deflicker node perform to reduce flicker?",
        "answer": "The Deflicker node reduces flicker by adjusting the brightness of each image based on the brightness of surrounding images in the sequence, applying techniques such as noise reduction, gradient smoothing, and dithering to each image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the intensity of blending in the Deflicker node?",
        "answer": "The intensity of blending in the Deflicker node is determined by the `blending_strength` input, which affects the subtlety of the deflickering effect applied to images in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, how is the sensitivity to flicker controlled in sequences of images?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the sensitivity to flicker in sequences of images is controlled through the `brightness_threshold` input parameter for the Deflicker node, where the minimum difference in brightness between the current image and the context average triggers an adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the degree of noise reduction applied by the Deflicker node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `noise_reduction_strength` input controls the degree of noise reduction applied by the Deflicker node in ComfyUI, enhancing the clarity of each image within the sequence."
