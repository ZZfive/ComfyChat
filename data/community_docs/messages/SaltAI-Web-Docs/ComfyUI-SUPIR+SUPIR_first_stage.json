        "question": "What is the SUPIR_first_stage node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_first_stage node in ComfyUI is designed for the initial processing of images using the SUPIR model to address compression artifacts and other noise, often resulting in a slightly blurred image as part of the noise reduction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the SUPIR_first_stage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_first_stage node in ComfyUI is implemented by the class named SUPIR_first_stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node status of the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_first_stage node is not an output node, indicated by `False` for output node status."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `SUPIR_VAE` input in the SUPIR_first_stage node used for?",
        "answer": "The `SUPIR_VAE` input specifies the SUPIR VAE model used for encoding and decoding in the denoising process during the first stage of image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input to the SUPIR_first_stage node represent?",
        "answer": "The `image` input represents the input image that is targeted for noise reduction and detail refinement by the SUPIR_first_stage node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `use_tiled_vae` input affect the processing in the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The `use_tiled_vae` input indicates whether to use a tiled approach for the VAE processing in the SUPIR_first_stage node, which can affect both performance and the outcome of image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `encoder_tile_size` input control in the SUPIR_first_stage node?",
        "answer": "The `encoder_tile_size` input controls the tile size for the encoder in the SUPIR_first_stage node, influencing the granularity of processing during the denoising stage."
