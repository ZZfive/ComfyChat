        "question": "What is the LineArtPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for extracting line art from images, specifically to create realistic line art representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'coarse' parameter have on the output of LineArtPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'coarse' parameter in LineArtPreprocessor allows users to toggle the coarseness of the line art extraction, enabling a choice between a more detailed or a more generalized representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'resolution' input affect the line art output by LineArtPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in LineArtPreprocessor specifies the resolution at which the image should be processed, which affects the detail level of the extracted line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can LineArtPreprocessor be paired within ComfyUI for further image processing?",
        "answer": "LineArtPreprocessor can be paired with several nodes in ComfyUI for further image processing, including PreviewImage, ControlNetApplyAdvanced, ControlNetApply, Control Net Stacker, ImageInvert, CR Multi-ControlNet Stack, and ACN_AdvancedControlNetApply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is an image that has been processed to extract realistic line art, represented as a torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What backend model does LineArtPreprocessor use to extract line art?",
        "answer": "LineArtPreprocessor uses a backend model, specifically LineartDetector from the controlnet_aux library, which is loaded and run on the GPU to process the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can LineArtPreprocessor be used on images of different resolutions?",
        "answer": "Yes, LineArtPreprocessor can process images at different resolutions, as the 'resolution' parameter allows for the adjustment of the processing detail."
