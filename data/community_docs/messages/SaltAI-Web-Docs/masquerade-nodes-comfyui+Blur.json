        "question": "What is the class name for the node that applies a Gaussian blur to an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that applies a Gaussian blur to an image in ComfyUI is `Blur`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Blur node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Blur node belongs to the `Masquerade Nodes` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Blur node in ComfyUI, and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Blur node in ComfyUI are `image` (represents the input image to be blurred), `radius` (determines the radius of the blur effect), and `sigma_factor` (controls the spread of the blur effect)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `radius` parameter in the Blur node affect the image?",
        "answer": "The `radius` parameter in the Blur node affects the image by determining the intensity of the blur effect; a larger radius results in a more pronounced blur, making the image softer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `sigma_factor` in the Blur node within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `sigma_factor` in the Blur node within ComfyUI is used to control the spread of the blur effect; a higher sigma value increases the spread, resulting in a more intense and softer blur effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of blur does the Blur node in ComfyUI apply?",
        "answer": "The Blur node in ComfyUI applies a Gaussian blur to an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and dtype of the image after it has been processed by the Blur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the image after being processed by the Blur node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, with the dtype being `torch.Tensor`."
