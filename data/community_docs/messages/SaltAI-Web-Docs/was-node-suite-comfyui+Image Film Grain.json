    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Film Grain node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Film Grain node include an `image`, `density`, `intensity`, `highlights`, and `supersample_factor`, all crucial for transforming the image with the desired grain effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the density input affect the image in the Image Film Grain node?",
        "answer": "The density input in the Image Film Grain node controls the density of the grain effect, affecting how many noise pixels are added to the image. Higher values result in a more pronounced grain effect on the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the intensity input in the Image Film Grain node?",
        "answer": "The intensity input in the Image Film Grain node adjusts the intensity of the grain effect, influencing the visibility and impact of the grain on the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the supersample_factor input have on the output of the Image Film Grain node?",
        "answer": "The supersample_factor input in the Image Film Grain node acts as a factor for supersampling the image before applying the grain, which can enhance the quality and detail of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes in ComfyUI can be used to adjust the grain appearance of an image?",
        "answer": "The Image Film Grain node in ComfyUI can be used to adjust the grain appearance of an image, allowing you to customize the density, intensity, and highlights of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Image Film Grain node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Film Grain node falls under the category `WAS Suite/Image/Filter` in ComfyUI."
