        "question": "What is the `easy imageInterrogator` node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy imageInterrogator` node is designed to generate descriptive prompts based on input images, using different modes to adjust the interrogation process according to the desired level of detail or speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the `easy imageInterrogator` node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy imageInterrogator` node belongs to the 'EasyUse/Image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `image` parameter in the `easy imageInterrogator` node?",
        "answer": "The `image` parameter is the visual content that the node analyzes to generate a descriptive prompt, central to the node's operation as the output is based on the interpretation of this image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `mode` parameter influence the output of the `easy imageInterrogator` node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` parameter in the `easy imageInterrogator` node allows users to specify the interrogation process's detail level or speed, with options like 'fast', 'classic', 'best', and 'negative', influencing the prompt's quality and generation time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output `prompt` generated by the `easy imageInterrogator` node?",
        "answer": "The `prompt` output generated by the `easy imageInterrogator` node is of data type `STRING` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `use_lowvram` parameter for in the `easy imageInterrogator` node?",
        "answer": "The `use_lowvram` parameter in the `easy imageInterrogator` node enables the node to operate in a low VRAM mode, optimizing resource usage for systems with limited graphics memory, which can affect the interrogation process's efficiency and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the `easy imageInterrogator` node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the `easy imageInterrogator` node is a GPU."
