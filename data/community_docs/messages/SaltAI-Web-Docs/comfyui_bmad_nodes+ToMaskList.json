        "question": "What is the role of the ToMaskList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToMaskList node is designed to convert a collection of inputs into a list of masks, playing a crucial role in organizing and preparing mask data for further processing or manipulation within a pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the ToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the ToMaskList node is `ToMaskList`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ToMaskList node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToMaskList node belongs to the category `Bmad/Lists/Make or Intercalate` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ToMaskList node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the ToMaskList node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'inputs_len' parameter in the ToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter represents the collection of inputs that are to be converted into a list of masks and is essential for the node's operation as it directly influences the composition of the output mask list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the 'inputs_len' parameter use in ComfyUI and Python?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'inputs_len' parameter uses the dtype `INT`, and in Python, it uses the dtype `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ToMaskList node output and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The ToMaskList node outputs a list of masks, with the Comfy dtype being `MASK` and the Python dtype being `List[torch.Tensor]`."
