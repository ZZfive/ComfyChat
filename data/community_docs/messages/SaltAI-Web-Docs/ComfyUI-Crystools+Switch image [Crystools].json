        "question": "What is the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node is used for conditional selection between two image inputs based on a boolean value. It allows for control flow in image processing pipelines, enabling dynamic path selection and conditional image manipulation or routing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs does the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node require?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node requires three types of inputs: 'on_true' and 'on_false', both of which are images (dtype: IMAGE) to be selected based on a boolean condition, and 'boolean' which is the condition itself (dtype: BOOLEAN) used to decide between the two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node determines the output based on a condition?",
        "answer": "The input 'boolean' determines the output of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node based on the evaluated boolean condition. If true, 'on_true' is selected; if false, 'on_false' is selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node is an image (dtype: IMAGE), which is selected based on the evaluation of the boolean condition between 'on_true' and 'on_false'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, what node facilitates the selection of an image based on a boolean condition?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node facilitates the selection of an image based on a boolean condition in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing can the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node support in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node can support conditional image processing in ComfyUI, allowing for dynamic path selection and flexibility in image manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'Switch image [Crystools]' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Switch image [Crystools]' node has one output type, 'image', which is the output image selected based on the boolean condition (dtype: IMAGE)."
