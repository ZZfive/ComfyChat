    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node in the MTB framework?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node is to seamlessly patch models within the MTB framework, enhancing their functionality or performance without altering their core structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does Model Patch Seamless (mtb) require?",
        "answer": "Model Patch Seamless (mtb) requires the following inputs: `model` (Comfy dtype: `MODEL`, Python dtype: `torch.nn.Module`), `startStep` (Comfy dtype: `INT`, Python dtype: `int`), `stopStep` (Comfy dtype: `INT`, Python dtype: `int`), `tilingX` (Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`, Python dtype: `bool`), and `tilingY` (Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`, Python dtype: `bool`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `tilingX` input do in the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `tilingX` input in the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node is a boolean flag that indicates whether tiling should be applied along the X-axis, affecting the model's processing of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node output?",
        "answer": "The Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node outputs an `Original Model (passthrough)` which is the original model passed through without modifications, and a `Patched Model`, which is the modified version of the original model, enhanced with seamless patching to improve functionality or performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node, what does the `startStep` input specify?",
        "answer": "The `startStep` input in the Model Patch Seamless (mtb) node specifies the starting step for the patching process, allowing for targeted modifications within the model's operation."
