        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Text Cycler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Text Cycler node in ComfyUI is designed to repeat and loop through given text lines, creating a list of text items based on specified repetition and loop counts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Text Cycler node handle the input 'text'?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input is a multiline string that the CR Text Cycler node splits into lines to be cycled through, serving as the base content for repetition and looping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'repeats' parameter play in the CR Text Cycler node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeats' parameter controls how many times each line of text is repeated within a single loop, influencing the density of repetition for each text item and impacting the overall length and composition of the output list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CR Text Cycler node determines the number of times the entire set of text lines is looped over?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter determines the number of times the entire set of text lines is looped over, affecting the final size of the output list by repeating the sequence of text items multiple times."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of outputs does the CR Text Cycler node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Text Cycler node outputs a list of text items generated by cycling through the input text lines according to the specified parameters, as well as a URL providing additional help and documentation for using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the length of the output list generated by the CR Text Cycler node?",
        "answer": "The length of the output list generated by the CR Text Cycler node is determined by the number of input text lines, the number of repeats for each line, and the number of loops over the entire set of text lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the function of the 'show_text' output in the CR Text Cycler node?",
        "answer": "The 'show_text' output in the CR Text Cycler node is a URL that provides additional help and documentation for using the CR Text Cycler node, which can be accessed by users for more information or troubleshooting."
