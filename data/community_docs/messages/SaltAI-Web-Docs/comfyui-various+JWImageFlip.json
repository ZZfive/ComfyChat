        "question": "What is the JWImageFlip node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The JWImageFlip node in ComfyUI is used for flipping images either horizontally or vertically based on the specified direction, which is essential for orientation adjustments in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the JWImageFlip node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageFlip node belongs to the `jamesWalker55` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageFlip node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageFlip node are the `image` type representing the image tensor to be flipped, and the `direction` type specifying whether to flip horizontally or vertically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input in JWImageFlip represent and what are its data types?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in JWImageFlip represents the image tensor to be flipped. Its data type is `IMAGE` in ComfyUI and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can JWImageFlip flip an image vertically or horizontally, and how is the direction specified?",
        "answer": "Yes, JWImageFlip can flip an image either vertically or horizontally. The direction of the flip is specified through a string input, either 'horizontal' or 'vertical', which determines the orientation of the flip."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWImageFlip node in ComfyUI and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWImageFlip node is the flipped image tensor. Its data type is `IMAGE` in ComfyUI, and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is used by the JWImageFlip node?",
        "answer": "The JWImageFlip node uses the `GPU` infra type, indicating that it can leverage GPU acceleration for its operations."
