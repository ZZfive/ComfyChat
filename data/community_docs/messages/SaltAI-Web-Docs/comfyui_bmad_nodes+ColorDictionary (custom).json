        "question": "What is the ColorDictionary (custom) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorDictionary (custom) node in ComfyUI is used to create a custom color dictionary by mapping user-defined color names to their corresponding color values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ColorDictionary (custom) node?",
        "answer": "The ColorDictionary (custom) node requires two input types: `color_names` (a list of user-defined names for colors) and `colors` (a list of color values corresponding to the provided color names)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ColorDictionary (custom) node handle the mismatch between color names and color values?",
        "answer": "If the number of color names does not match the number of color values, the ColorDictionary (custom) node adjusts the lists to match in length, ensuring they are equal before creating the color dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ColorDictionary (custom) node provide?",
        "answer": "The ColorDictionary (custom) node provides a single output type `color_dict`, which is the resulting custom color dictionary mapping the provided color names to their corresponding color values."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the ColorDictionary (custom) node run on GPU?",
        "answer": "No, the ColorDictionary (custom) node cannot run on GPU. It is designed to run on CPU as specified by its Infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ColorDictionary (custom) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorDictionary (custom) node belongs to the category `Bmad/CV/Color A.` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In Python, what is the expected data type for the output of the ColorDictionary (custom) node?",
        "answer": "In Python, the output of the ColorDictionary (custom) node is expected to be a dictionary with string keys and color values represented as tuples of integers (Dict[str, Tuple[int, int, int]]."
