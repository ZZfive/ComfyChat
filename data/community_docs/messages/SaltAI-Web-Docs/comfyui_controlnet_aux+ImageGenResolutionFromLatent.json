        "question": "What is ImageGenResolutionFromLatent in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImageGenResolutionFromLatent is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to calculate the generation resolution for images based on the dimensions of a given latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does ImageGenResolutionFromLatent fall?",
        "answer": "ImageGenResolutionFromLatent falls under the category of 'ControlNet Preprocessors' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the latent representation in ImageGenResolutionFromLatent?",
        "answer": "The latent representation in ImageGenResolutionFromLatent is used to calculate the desired output dimensions by scaling its height and width for determining the appropriate resolution of the image to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does ImageGenResolutionFromLatent produce?",
        "answer": "ImageGenResolutionFromLatent produces two output types: 'IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH (INT)' and 'IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT (INT)', which represent the calculated width and height for image generation derived from the latent's dimensions and scaled appropriately."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the inferred output of ImageGenResolutionFromLatent?",
        "answer": "The inferred output of ImageGenResolutionFromLatent is the calculated dimensions for image generation, including the IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH and IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT, which are derived through scaling the dimensions of the latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required by ImageGenResolutionFromLatent?",
        "answer": "ImageGenResolutionFromLatent requires a latent representation as input, which is used to calculate the desired output dimensions by scaling its height and width."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the image generation width and height calculated in ImageGenResolutionFromLatent?",
        "answer": "In ImageGenResolutionFromLatent, the image generation width and height are calculated by multiplying the width (W) and height (H), derived from the shape of the latent's 'samples', by 8, resulting in the computed 'IMAGE_GEN_WIDTH' and 'IMAGE_GEN_HEIGHT'."
