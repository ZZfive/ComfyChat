    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'a' parameter in CM_BreakoutVec2 represent?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in CM_BreakoutVec2 represents a 2-dimensional vector that needs to be decomposed into separate x and y values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the CM_BreakoutVec2 node consist of?",
        "answer": "The output of the CM_BreakoutVec2 node consists of two float values, which represent the x and y components of the input vector, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' function of the CM_BreakoutVec2 node do?",
        "answer": "The 'op' function of the CM_BreakoutVec2 node decomposes the input 2-dimensional vector 'a' into its x and y components and returns them as a tuple of float values."
