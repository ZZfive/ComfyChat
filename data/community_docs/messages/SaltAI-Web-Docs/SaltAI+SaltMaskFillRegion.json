        "question": "What is the class name of the node designed to fill regions within masks in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node designed to fill regions within masks in ComfyUI is `SaltMaskFillRegion`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskFillRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskFillRegion node is `masks`, which is crucial for determining the areas within each mask that will undergo the filling operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `masks` parameter require in the SaltMaskFillRegion node?",
        "answer": "The `masks` parameter in the SaltMaskFillRegion node requires a data type of `MASK` in ComfyUI's dtype and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltMaskFillRegion node do to the input masks?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskFillRegion node transforms the input masks by identifying and filling specified regions, producing modified masks."
