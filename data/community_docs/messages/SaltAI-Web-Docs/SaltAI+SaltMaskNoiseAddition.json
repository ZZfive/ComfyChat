        "question": "What is the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskNoiseAddition node is designed to introduce noise into mask regions in ComfyUI, simulating variations and imperfections that might occur in real-world scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in SaltMaskNoiseAddition controls the overall brightness or darkness of the added noise?",
        "answer": "The 'mean' parameter in SaltMaskNoiseAddition controls the overall brightness or darkness of the added noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'stddev' parameter have in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The 'stddev' parameter in SaltMaskNoiseAddition determines the standard deviation of the noise distribution, affecting the variability and intensity of the noise added to the masks, enabling fine-tuning of the noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is the 'masks' input in SaltMaskNoiseAddition?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input in SaltMaskNoiseAddition is of type Comfy dtype: `MASK`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`, representing a collection of mask regions to which noise will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class in the source code implements the functionality of the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node?",
        "answer": "The class `SaltMaskNoiseAddition` in the source code implements the functionality of the SaltMaskNoiseAddition node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does SaltMaskNoiseAddition generate?",
        "answer": "SaltMaskNoiseAddition generates an output of type Comfy dtype: `MASK`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`, consisting of the original mask regions with added noise, reflecting the specified mean and standard deviation parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'noise_addition' function in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition class?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_addition' function in the SaltMaskNoiseAddition class is responsible for the actual addition of noise to the masks based on the specified parameters such as mean and standard deviation."
