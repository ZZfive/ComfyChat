        "question": "What is CM_Vec2UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs unary operations on 2-dimensional vectors, transforming a single vector based on a specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2UnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2UnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec2' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector, affecting the transformation result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'a' input accept in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation accepts a 2-dimensional vector (VEC2 data type) to be transformed by the unary operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'vec2' output represent in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'vec2' output in CM_Vec2UnaryOperation represents the transformed 2-dimensional vector resulting from the specified unary operation."
    },
