        "question": "What is ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions is a class in ComfyUI that provides static context options for the Animate Diff process, facilitating standardized configuration for animation generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions allow you to define?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions allows you to define parameters such as context_length, context_overlap, fuse_method, use_on_equal_length, start_percent, guarantee_steps, prev_context, and view_opts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of context_length in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "context_length in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions specifies the length of the context used in the animation, determining how many frames or steps are considered for each segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions handle context_overlap?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions handles context_overlap by defining the overlap between consecutive contexts in the animation, affecting the smoothness and continuity between frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does fuse_method determine in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "fuse_method in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions determines the method used to fuse multiple contexts together, influencing the final animation's fluidity and coherence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does use_on_equal_length control in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "use_on_equal_length in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions is a boolean flag that specifies whether to use the fuse method when contexts are of equal length, affecting the animation's uniformity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does start_percent function in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "start_percent in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions defines the starting point of the animation as a percentage, allowing customization of where the animation begins within the provided context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does guarantee_steps ensure in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions?",
        "answer": "guarantee_steps in ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions ensures a minimum number of steps or frames in the animation, providing a baseline for animation smoothness and continuity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions integrate prev_context?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions integrates prev_context by allowing the integration of previously defined context options, enabling the chaining or layering of context configurations for complex animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions output?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions outputs a configured set of context options tailored for static animation scenarios, ready for use in the Animate Diff process."
