        "question": "What is the Inpaint Preprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is used for image preprocessing in inpainting tasks, preparing images by applying masks to indicate areas for inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific value does the Inpaint Preprocessor set masked pixels to?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint Preprocessor sets masked pixels to -1.0, effectively indicating which areas of the image require inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Inpaint Preprocessor?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint Preprocessor requires an 'image' input, represented as a 'IMAGE' type, and a 'mask' input, represented as a 'MASK' type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Inpaint Preprocessor represents the input image for preprocessing?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter, of type 'IMAGE', represents the input image to be preprocessed for inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' input in the Inpaint Preprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the Inpaint Preprocessor specifies the areas of the input image that should be considered for inpainting, indicating which pixels should be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Inpaint Preprocessor provide?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint Preprocessor provides an output of type 'IMAGE', which is a preprocessed image with specified areas masked for inpainting, ready for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Inpaint Preprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Inpaint Preprocessor in ComfyUI is `Inference_Core_InpaintPreprocessor`."
