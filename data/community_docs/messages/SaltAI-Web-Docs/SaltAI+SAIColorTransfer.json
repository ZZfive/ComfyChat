        "question": "What is the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The SAIColorTransfer node is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for applying color transfer techniques between images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SAIColorTransfer node are `target_images`, `source_images`, and `mode`. `target_images` specifies the images whose color palettes are to be modified, `source_images` provides the color palette to be transferred, and `mode` determines the method of color transfer to be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SAIColorTransfer node is `images`, representing the resulting images after the color transfer process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `target_images` input represent in the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The `target_images` input in the SAIColorTransfer node specifies the images whose color palettes are to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `source_images` input represent in the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The `source_images` input in the SAIColorTransfer node defines the images that provide the color palette to be transferred to the target images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mode` input determine in the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in the SAIColorTransfer node determines the method of color transfer to be applied, such as PDF regraining, mean transfer, or LAB color space transfer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the SAIColorTransfer node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with the SAIColorTransfer node are unknown."
