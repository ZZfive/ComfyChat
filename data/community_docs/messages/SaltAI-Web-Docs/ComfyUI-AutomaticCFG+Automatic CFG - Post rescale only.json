        "question": "What is Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "Automatic CFG - Post rescale only is a class in ComfyUI designed to apply a post-processing rescaling operation to the output of a generative model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "The purpose of Automatic CFG - Post rescale only is to refine the model's predictions by adjusting the scale of the output, enhancing the balance between conditioned and unconditioned components of the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "The required input types for Automatic CFG - Post rescale only include the generative model, a boolean flag for subtracting the latent mean, and various parameters such as starting and ending sigma values for subtracting the latent mean, and flags and configurations related to rescaling the intensity of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Automatic CFG - Post rescale only adjust the generative model's output?",
        "answer": "Automatic CFG - Post rescale only adjusts the generative model's output by applying operations such as subtracting the latent mean and rescaling the intensity of the latent space, depending on the specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "The output type of Automatic CFG - Post rescale only is the modified generative model with the post-rescaling operation applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "Automatic CFG - Post rescale only belongs to the category 'model_patches/automatic_cfg/presets' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the rescaling of the intensity of the latent space performed in Automatic CFG - Post rescale only?",
        "answer": "The rescaling of the intensity of the latent space in Automatic CFG - Post rescale only is performed using a specified method (such as 'soft', 'hard', or 'range') and a configuration value."
