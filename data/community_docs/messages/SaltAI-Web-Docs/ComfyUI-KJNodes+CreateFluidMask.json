        "question": "What is the purpose of the CreateFluidMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFluidMask node in ComfyUI is designed to generate dynamic fluid-based masks for images, utilizing parameters such as inflow characteristics and dimensions to simulate fluid motion and interactions. This process is aimed at creating visually complex and varied masks that can be applied to images for artistic or processing purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `invert` parameter in CreateFluidMask do?",
        "answer": "The `invert` parameter in CreateFluidMask determines whether the fluid mask should be inverted, affecting the visual representation of the mask in relation to the fluid's motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters control the dimensions of the fluid simulation in CreateFluidMask?",
        "answer": "The dimensions of the fluid simulation in CreateFluidMask are controlled by the `width` and `height` parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the complexity of the fluid motion in the mask influenced by the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The complexity of the fluid motion in the mask is influenced by the `frames` parameter, which specifies the number of frames to simulate, dictating the duration of the fluid's motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `inflow_radius` parameter do in the CreateFluidMask node?",
        "answer": "The `inflow_radius` parameter in CreateFluidMask specifies the radius of the inflow points, impacting the size of the area through which fluid is introduced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the CreateFluidMask node provide?",
        "answer": "The CreateFluidMask node provides two types of outputs: `image`, which is the generated image mask that visually represents the fluid simulation, and `mask`, which is a binary mask that delineates the areas affected by the fluid simulation, useful for image processing applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters affect the inflow of fluid in the simulation within CreateFluidMask?",
        "answer": "The parameters that affect the inflow of fluid in the CreateFluidMask simulation include `inflow_count`, `inflow_velocity`, `inflow_radius`, and `inflow_padding`."
