        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDecomposeSEGS node is designed to decompose a given SEGS data structure into its constituent elements, facilitating the manipulation and analysis of the segmented data by breaking it down into more manageable parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node output?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDecomposeSEGS node outputs 'segs_header' and 'seg_elt'. 'segs_header' is the header information of the decomposed SEGS data structure, and 'seg_elt' represents the individual elements of the decomposed SEGS data structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is essential for the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The essential input for the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node is 'segs', which represents the SEGS data structure to be decomposed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDecomposeSEGS node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node associated with?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDecomposeSEGS node is associated with the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seg_elt' output in the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_elt' output of the ImpactDecomposeSEGS node is a list that represents the individual elements of the decomposed SEGS data structure, facilitating the representation of multiple segmented elements."
