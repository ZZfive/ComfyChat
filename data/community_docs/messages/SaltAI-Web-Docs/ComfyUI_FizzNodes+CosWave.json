        "question": "What is the CosWave node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CosWave node in ComfyUI is used to generate a cosine wave based on various parameters such as phase, amplitude, and translations, providing a simple interface for creating cosine waves for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the CosWave node belong to?",
        "answer": "The CosWave node belongs to the class `CosWave` under the category `FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/WaveNodes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter adjusts the height of the cosine wave in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter in the CosWave node controls the height of the cosine wave, determining how far it extends above and below its central axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'current_frame' parameter used for in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the CosWave node is used to specify the current frame or point in time for which the wave's value is being calculated, enabling the generation of dynamic, moving waves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'phase' parameter in the CosWave node adjust?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the CosWave node adjusts the phase shift of the cosine wave, affecting its starting position on the x-axis, allowing for fine-tuning the wave's alignment with other elements or waves."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the CosWave node, what does the 'x_translation' parameter do?",
        "answer": "In the CosWave node, the 'x_translation' parameter shifts the entire wave along the x-axis, allowing for precise positioning of the wave in relation to other graphical or wave elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output represented in the CosWave node?",
        "answer": "The CosWave node outputs a tuple where the first element is a float representing the calculated wave value, and the second element is an integer representation of the same value."
