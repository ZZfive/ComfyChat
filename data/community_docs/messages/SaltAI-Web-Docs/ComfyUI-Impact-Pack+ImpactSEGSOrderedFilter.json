        "question": "What is ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter is a custom node in ComfyUI that filters and orders segmentation data based on specified criteria, such as area, width, height, or coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' input represent in the ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' input represents the segmentation data to be filtered and ordered, serving as the primary input for the ordering and filtering operations in ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter determine the order of segments?",
        "answer": "ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter determines the order of segments based on the 'target' and 'order' inputs, where 'target' specifies the attribute based on which the segments should be ordered and 'order' determines whether the sorting is in descending or ascending order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'take_start' input in ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter?",
        "answer": "The 'take_start' input in ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter defines the starting index from which segments should be taken after ordering, which is crucial for selecting a specific subset of segments based on their order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'take_count' control in ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter?",
        "answer": "The 'take_count' input in ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter specifies the number of segments to take starting from the 'take_start' index, enabling the control over the size of the resulting segment subset after ordering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'filtered_SEGS' output of ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter represent?",
        "answer": "The 'filtered_SEGS' output of ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter represents the segments that have been filtered and ordered according to the specified criteria, providing a refined set of data after the ordering and filtering operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'remained_SEGS' output in the ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter node?",
        "answer": "The 'remained_SEGS' output in the ImpactSEGSOrderedFilter node represents the segments that did not meet the filtering criteria and were not included in the ordered subset, providing additional information about the processing and filtering of the data."
