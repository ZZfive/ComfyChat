        "question": "What is the purpose of the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetMask node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a mask to conditioning data, allowing for the adjustment of the area and strength of the conditioning based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cond_ADD' input represent in the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond_ADD' input in the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node represents the conditioning data to be added or modified, which is essential for introducing new contexts or content into the existing conditioning framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'strength' parameter in ADE_ConditioningSetMask affect the conditioning data?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in ADE_ConditioningSetMask defines the intensity of the mask's effect on the conditioning data, allowing for fine-tuned control over the modification's impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'set_cond_area' in ADE_ConditioningSetMask determine?",
        "answer": "The 'set_cond_area' parameter in ADE_ConditioningSetMask determines whether the mask's effect is applied to the default area or the bounds of the mask, providing flexibility in targeting specific regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input allows for the application of Lora hooks in the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node?",
        "answer": "The optional input 'opt_lora_hook' in ADE_ConditioningSetMask allows for the application of Lora hooks to the conditioning, further customizing the conditioning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node is the modified conditioning data, which reflects the applied mask and adjustments, including any additional conditioning data added."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node belong within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_ConditioningSetMask node belongs in the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/single cond ops' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'opt_mask' input in the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'opt_mask' input in the ADE_ConditioningSetMask node is an optional mask that specifies the areas of the conditioning data to be modified, offering additional control over which parts of the conditioning are affected."
