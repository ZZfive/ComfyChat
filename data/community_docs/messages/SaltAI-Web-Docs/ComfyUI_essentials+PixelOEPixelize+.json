        "question": "What is the PixelOEPixelize+ node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The PixelOEPixelize+ node is designed to transform images into pixelized versions of themselves, applying a series of image processing techniques to achieve a stylized, pixel-art effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in PixelOEPixelize+ controls the size of individual pixels or patches in the pixelized image?",
        "answer": "The parameter that controls the size of individual pixels or patches in the pixelized image is 'patch_size'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of value is the input 'image' parameter in the PixelOEPixelize+ node?",
        "answer": "The input 'image' parameter in the PixelOEPixelize+ node is of type 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'downscale_mode' parameter influence in the PixelOEPixelize+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'downscale_mode' parameter in the PixelOEPixelize+ node influences the method used for downscaling the image as part of the pixelization process, affecting the visual style of the pixelized output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter adjusts the thickness of lines or borders between pixels in the PixelOEPixelize+ node?",
        "answer": "The parameter that adjusts the thickness of lines or borders between pixels in the PixelOEPixelize+ node is called 'thickness'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'upscale' parameter affect the pixelized image in the PixelOEPixelize+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale' parameter in the PixelOEPixelize+ node determines whether the pixelized image should be upscaled back to its original size, affecting the final resolution and appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the PixelOEPixelize+ node, what does the 'color_matching' parameter do?",
        "answer": "The 'color_matching' parameter in the PixelOEPixelize+ node influences how colors are matched and blended in the pixelized output, affecting the image's color accuracy and aesthetic."
