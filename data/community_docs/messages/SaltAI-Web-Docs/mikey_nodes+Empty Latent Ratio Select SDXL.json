        "question": "What is the purpose of the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node is designed to generate a tensor representing an empty latent space based on a selected ratio from predefined options, facilitating the creation of a latent space with specific dimensions that adhere to a user-selected aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the dimensions of the latent space generated by Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL?",
        "answer": "The dimensions of the latent space generated by Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL are determined by the aspect ratio specified by the `ratio_selected` input, ensuring that the generated content aligns with the selected proportions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `batch_size` parameter used for in Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` parameter in Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL determines the number of latent spaces to generate in a single batch, allowing for the efficient creation of multiple latent spaces with the same dimensions in one operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the datatype of the `latent` output in the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node?",
        "answer": "The `latent` output in the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node is a tensor representing the empty latent space, structured to match the dimensions dictated by the selected aspect ratio and batch size. The Comfy dtype for `latent` is `LATENT`, and the Python dtype is `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes work well with the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that work well with the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node in ComfyUI include KSamplerAdvanced, KSampler, Anything Everywhere, and LatentUpscaleBy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ratio_selected` input datatype in Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL correspond to in Python?",
        "answer": "The `ratio_selected` input datatype in Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL corresponds to a `COMBO[STRING]` in ComfyUI and a `Tuple[str]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what kind of infrastructure is the Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node most effective?",
        "answer": "The Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL node is most effective in GPU infrastructure, as indicated by its infra type."
