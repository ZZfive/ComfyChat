        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the audio experience by selectively boosting the frequency of an audio signal, allowing for precise adjustments to the audio's frequency spectrum."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node require to selectively boost the frequency of an audio signal?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node requires the raw audio data, the center frequency to boost, the bandwidth defining the width of the frequency band to be boosted, and the amount of gain to apply to the specified frequency band, measured in decibels (dB)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the bandwidth input in SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node define?",
        "answer": "The bandwidth input in the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node defines the width of the frequency band around the center frequency that will be boosted, determining the range of frequencies affected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'frequency' input in the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'frequency' input in the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node is 'INT' (integer) in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of hardware should SaltAudioFrequencyBoost be run?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioFrequencyBoost should be run on a CPU, as specified by its 'Infra type'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI is the audio data after the frequency boost has been applied, reflecting the enhancements made to the specified frequency band, with a data type of 'AUDIO' which is represented by 'bytes' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class is associated with the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the SaltAudioFrequencyBoost node in ComfyUI is `SaltAudioFrequencyBoost`."
