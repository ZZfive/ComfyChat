        "question": "What is the Apply ControlNet Stack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet Stack node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the conditioning of positive and negative prompts by applying a stack of control networks, allowing dynamic adjustments based on specified control networks, images, and strength parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'positive' in the Apply ControlNet Stack node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input serves as the initial input for the control network stack application, which influences the image generation towards desired attributes or themes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'negative' input in the Apply ControlNet Stack node?",
        "answer": "The 'negative' input acts as a counterpart to the 'positive' input, guiding the image generation away from undesired attributes or themes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'cnet_stack' used in the Apply ControlNet Stack node?",
        "answer": "The 'cnet_stack' input is an optional stack of control networks and associated parameters that are applied sequentially to the positive and negative prompts, enabling complex, layered adjustments to the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Apply ControlNet Stack node produce as outputs?",
        "answer": "The Apply ControlNet Stack node produces the conditioned positive prompt ('CONDITIONING+') and the conditioned negative prompt ('CONDITIONING-') after the application of the control network stack."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of inputs does Apply ControlNet Stack require?",
        "answer": "Apply ControlNet Stack requires 'positive' and 'negative' prompts, both of type CONDITIONING and can optionally take a 'cnet_stack' of type CONTROL_NET_STACK."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Apply ControlNet Stack run on GPU or is it limited to CPU?",
        "answer": "Apply ControlNet Stack is specified to run on the CPU."
