        "question": "What is the FL_ImageDurationSync node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The FL_ImageDurationSync node in ComfyUI is used to synchronize the duration of a sequence of images with a specific musical beat per minute (BPM), frame count, and bars, adjusting the number of frames each image is held to match the desired total duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does the FL_ImageDurationSync node require?",
        "answer": "The FL_ImageDurationSync node requires the following input types: 'images' (sequence of images to be synchronized), 'frame_count' (total number of frames for the output sequence), 'bpm' (beats per minute of the audio track), 'fps' (frames per second rate at which the images will be displayed), and 'bars' (number of musical bars over which the images will be synchronized)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the FL_ImageDurationSync node generate?",
        "answer": "The FL_ImageDurationSync node generates the following output types: 'output_images' (the sequence of images adjusted to match the desired duration) and 'hold_frames' (the number of frames each image is held)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FL_ImageDurationSync node calculate the number of frames for each image to be held?",
        "answer": "The FL_ImageDurationSync node calculates the number of frames for each image to be held based on the BPM, bars, and FPS inputs, to achieve synchronization with the audio track."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'bars' input in FL_ImageDurationSync?",
        "answer": "The 'bars' input in FL_ImageDurationSync directly impacts the total duration of the visual sequence by specifying the number of musical bars over which the images will be synchronized."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the duration of images to match the rhythm of a musical track?",
        "answer": "The FL_ImageDurationSync node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the duration of images to match the rhythm of a musical track by synchronizing the image sequence with beats per minute (BPM), frame count, bars, and frames per second (FPS)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'hold_frames' output of the FL_ImageDurationSync node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'hold_frames' output of the FL_ImageDurationSync node represents the number of frames each image is held, calculated based on the BPM, bars, and FPS to achieve the desired synchronization."
