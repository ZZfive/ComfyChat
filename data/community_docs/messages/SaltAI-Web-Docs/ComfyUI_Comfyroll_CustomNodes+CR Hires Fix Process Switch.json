        "question": "What is the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The CR Hires Fix Process Switch node is designed to selectively process high-resolution images or upscale latent representations based on the input provided. It facilitates the choice between two distinct processing paths, either focusing on image upscaling or latent space manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the processing path for the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The processing path for the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node is determined by the 'Input' value. If set to 'latent_upscale', the node processes the latent representation; if set to 'image_upscale', it processes the high-resolution image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of dtype does the 'Input' take in the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' in the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node takes a `COMBO[STRING]` dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'latent_upscale' input in the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'latent_upscale' input in the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node is a `tuple`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'image_upscale' input have on the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_upscale' input determines the node's focus on enhancing the image's resolution or detail when the 'Input' is set to 'image_upscale', directly impacting the visual quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR Hires Fix Process Switch node include 'LATENT' (representing either the upscaled latent representation or the processed high-resolution image) and 'STRING' (a URL to a help page for additional information)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch switch method do?",
        "answer": "The switch method of the CR_HiResFixProcessSwitch class determines the output based on the 'Input' value. If 'Input' is 'latent_upscale', it returns the 'latent_upscale' input along with a help URL; if 'Input' is 'image_upscale', it returns the 'image_upscale' input along with a help URL."
