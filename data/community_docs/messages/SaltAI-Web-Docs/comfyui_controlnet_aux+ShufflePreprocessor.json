        "question": "What is the ShufflePreprocessor node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ShufflePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images by applying a content shuffle detection algorithm, which is crucial for tasks requiring the identification or manipulation of shuffled content within images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ShufflePreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ShufflePreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/T2IAdapter-only' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ShufflePreprocessor node include 'image' which can be a PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray, 'resolution' as an INT, and 'seed' as an INT for random number generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ShufflePreprocessor node produce?",
        "answer": "The ShufflePreprocessor node produces an 'image' output after applying the content shuffle detection algorithm. This image is processed and represents the detected shuffled content within the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter influences the detection accuracy and performance of the ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter, which specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, can influence the detection accuracy and performance of the ShufflePreprocessor node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'seed' parameter in the context of ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in ShufflePreprocessor is a seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the shuffle detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the ShufflePreprocessor node's processed image?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the ShufflePreprocessor node's processed image is 'IMAGE', which can be represented as a PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray in Python."
