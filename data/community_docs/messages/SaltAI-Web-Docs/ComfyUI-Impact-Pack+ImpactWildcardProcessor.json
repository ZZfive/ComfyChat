    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactWildcardProcessor node include: `wildcard_text`, which is the text containing wildcards that need to be populated; `populated_text`, which is the text after wildcards have been replaced; `mode`, a boolean flag indicating whether the text should be populated; `seed`, an integer used to seed the random number generator; and `Select to add Wildcard`, which allows the user to select specific wildcards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `wildcard_text` input do in ImpactWildcardProcessor?",
        "answer": "The `wildcard_text` input in ImpactWildcardProcessor provides the text containing wildcards that need to be populated. It serves as the template for generating dynamic content."
