        "question": "What does the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node in ComfyUI transforms facial landmarks detected by MediaPipe's FaceMesh into a structured format suitable for SEGS (Segmentation and Geometry Schema), enabling further manipulation and analysis of facial features within the SEGS framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the extent to which the detected facial region is cropped in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The input that determines the extent to which the detected facial region is cropped is the `crop_factor` in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `bbox_fill` input in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `bbox_fill` input in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node specifies how the bounding box around detected facial landmarks is filled, influencing the appearance and structure of the resulting SEGS."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `crop_min_size` input used in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_min_size` input in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node sets the minimum size for the cropped facial region, ensuring that the output SEGS does not fall below a certain spatial resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the `dilation` input have on the output of the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `dilation` input in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node applies a dilation operation to the facial landmarks' bounding box, expanding its size and potentially including additional context in the SEGS output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node are used to specify the inclusion of specific facial features in the SEGS output?",
        "answer": "The `face`, `mouth`, `left_eyebrow`, `left_eye`, `left_pupil`, `right_eyebrow`, `right_eye`, and `right_pupil` inputs in the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node are used to specify the inclusion of specific facial features in the SEGS output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MediaPipeFaceMeshToSEGS node is `SEGS`, which represents a structured SEGS (Segmentation and Geometry Schema) representation of the detected facial landmarks, suitable for further processing and analysis within the SEGS framework."
