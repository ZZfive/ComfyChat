        "question": "What is the CinematicLook node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The CinematicLook node in ComfyUI is designed to transform images by applying a cinematic look, combining techniques from ImageOverlay and HALDClut to enhance visuals with a film-like aesthetic, incorporating various styles such as modern, retro, and black and white."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CinematicLook node represents the visual content to be transformed?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the CinematicLook node represents the visual content to be transformed and serves as the base for applying the cinematic look."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'look' parameter in the CinematicLook node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'look' parameter in the CinematicLook node specifies the desired cinematic style to be applied to the image, such as 'modern', 'retro', or 'black and white', influencing the visual characteristics and mood of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'image' parameter in the CinematicLook node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'image' parameter in the CinematicLook node is 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CinematicLook node called and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the CinematicLook node is called 'result_img', which is a torch.Tensor representing the transformed image with the applied cinematic look."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CinematicLook node apply a 'modern' look to an image?",
        "answer": "The CinematicLook node applies a 'modern' look to an image by using the 'apply_haldclut' method to apply the 'modern.png' haldclut file to the image, and then overlays the modified image with a noise image at a specified opacity of 0.3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the execution of the CinematicLook node?",
        "answer": "The CinematicLook node is recommended to be executed using an 'infra type' of 'GPU'."
