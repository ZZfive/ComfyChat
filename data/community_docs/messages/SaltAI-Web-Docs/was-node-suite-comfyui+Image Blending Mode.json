        "question": "What is the Image Blending Mode node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI is used to blend two images together using a variety of blending modes, allowing for the creation of composite images by applying different mathematical operations to the pixel values of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI are `image_a`, `image_b`, `mode`, and `blend_percentage`. `image_a` and `image_b` are the two images to be blended, `mode` specifies the blending mode, and `blend_percentage` determines the intensity of the blend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type for the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type for the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, which is the result of blending the two input images according to the specified mode and blend percentage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some tips when using the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "When using the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI, it is recommended to use it with an Infra type of `GPU`. Common nodes that can be used with the Image Blending Mode node are the PreviewImage node and the VAEEncode node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the blending modes available in the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI offers multiple blending modes, including add, color, color_burn, color_dodge, darken, difference, exclusion, hard_light, hue, lighten, multiply, overlay, screen, and soft_light."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `blend_percentage` parameter used in the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `blend_percentage` parameter in the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI determines the intensity of the blend between the two images. A higher percentage results in a stronger influence of the second image on the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI produce a composite image?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Image Blending Mode node in ComfyUI can produce a composite image by blending two input images based on the selected mode, and the blend percentage."
