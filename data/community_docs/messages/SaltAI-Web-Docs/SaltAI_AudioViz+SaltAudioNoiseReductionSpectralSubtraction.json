        "question": "What is the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node in ComfyUI is designed to apply spectral subtraction-based noise reduction to audio inputs, which helps in reducing background noise and enhancing audio clarity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the noise reduction node in the SALT/Audio/Effect category?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the noise reduction node in the SALT/Audio/Effect category is `SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `audio` input in the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node?",
        "answer": "The `audio` input in the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node is used for the raw audio data that needs to be processed for noise reduction."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to control the extent of noise removal in audio inputs?",
        "answer": "The `noise_floor` input in the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node controls the extent of noise removal in audio inputs by setting the threshold for noise reduction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node is the processed audio data with reduced noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node dictates the level of noise reduction?",
        "answer": "The `noise_floor` parameter in the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node dictates the level of noise reduction by setting the threshold for noise detection and removal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of spectral subtraction in audio processing?",
        "answer": "In the context of the SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction node, spectral subtraction is used to subtract the estimated noise spectrum from the noisy audio signal's spectrum to achieve noise reduction."
