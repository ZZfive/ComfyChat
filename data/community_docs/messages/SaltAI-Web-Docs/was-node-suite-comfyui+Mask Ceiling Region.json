        "question": "What is the Mask Ceiling Region node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Ceiling Region node in ComfyUI is used for identifying and isolating the ceiling regions within given mask images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Mask Ceiling Region node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Ceiling Region node belongs to the WAS Suite/Image/Masking category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the Mask Ceiling Region node?",
        "answer": "The Mask Ceiling Region node requires a single input of type MASK, representing the images from which the ceiling regions are to be extracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the Mask Ceiling Region node provide?",
        "answer": "The Mask Ceiling Region node outputs a tensor of masks, specifically highlighting the ceiling regions within the original input images, with the output type being MASK."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the ceiling_region method in the WAS_Mask_Ceiling_Region class?",
        "answer": "The ceiling_region method in the WAS_Mask_Ceiling_Region class is responsible for identifying the ceiling regions in the input masks and returning a tensor of masks highlighting these regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Mask Ceiling Region node handle multiple input masks?",
        "answer": "When the Mask Ceiling Region node receives multiple input masks, it processes each mask individually by identifying the ceiling region and combining them into a single output tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the input and output masks for the Mask Ceiling Region node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the input and output masks for the Mask Ceiling Region node is torch.Tensor."
