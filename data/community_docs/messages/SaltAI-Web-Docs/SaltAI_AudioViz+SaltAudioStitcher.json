        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioStitcher node is designed for stitching together two audio files with an optional silent transition between them, enabling the creation of a seamless audio experience by combining multiple audio segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the audio_a input play in the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The audio_a input in the SaltAudioStitcher node serves as the first audio file to be stitched, acting as the starting point of the stitched audio output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of data does the audio_a input expect in the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The audio_a input in the SaltAudioStitcher node expects data of type `AUDIO` in ComfyUI and `bytes` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the silent_transition_seconds parameter used in the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The silent_transition_seconds parameter in the SaltAudioStitcher node specifies the duration of silence in seconds to insert between the two audio files, allowing for a smooth transition or pause between the audio segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the silent_transition_seconds parameter expect in the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The silent_transition_seconds parameter in the SaltAudioStitcher node expects a Python data type of `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Stitched_audio output represent in the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The Stitched_audio output in the SaltAudioStitcher node represents the resulting audio file after stitching the input audio files together, potentially with a silent transition in between."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for the functionality of the SaltAudioStitcher node?",
        "answer": "The functionality of the SaltAudioStitcher node is provided by the `SaltAudioStitcher` class."
