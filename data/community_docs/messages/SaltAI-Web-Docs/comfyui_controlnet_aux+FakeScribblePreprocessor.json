        "question": "What is the purpose of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images to simulate scribble lines, using a modified HED model to produce images with stylized edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FakeScribblePreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is theINFRA type of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The INFRA type of the FakeScribblePreprocessor node is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node requires an `image` input with Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FakeScribblePreprocessor node process the input image?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node processes the input image by simulating scribble-like lines using a modified HED model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs can be used with the FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The FakeScribblePreprocessor node can use optional inputs such as `safe`, which when enabled, applies safety mechanisms to the preprocessing, and `resolution`, which adjusts the detail level of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used with the FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that can be used with the FakeScribblePreprocessor node include ACN_AdvancedControlNetApply and PreviewImage."
