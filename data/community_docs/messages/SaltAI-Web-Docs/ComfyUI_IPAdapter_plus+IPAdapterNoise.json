        "question": "What is the IPAdapterNoise node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterNoise node in ComfyUI is used for adding noise to images, with options to customize the type, strength, and blur level of the noise. It can work with existing images to alter their appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of noise can the IPAdapterNoise node apply?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterNoise node can apply 'fade', 'dissolve', 'gaussian', and 'shuffle' types of noise to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IPAdapterNoise node adjust the strength of the applied noise?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterNoise node adjusts the strength of the applied noise by using a parameter that determines the intensity of the noise added to the image, allowing control over how pronounced the noise effect will be."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the IPAdapterNoise node add noise to an existing image?",
        "answer": "Yes, the IPAdapterNoise node can add noise to an existing image optionally. This can enhance or alter its appearance with the addition of noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the IPAdapterNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output of the IPAdapterNoise node is a modified image tensor with applied noise, potentially blurred, reflecting the specified noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node categories does IPAdapterNoise belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, IPAdapterNoise belongs to the category of 'ipadapter/utils'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'image' output of IPAdapterNoise?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'image' output of IPAdapterNoise is 'torch.Tensor'."
