        "question": "What is the Stack Images (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Stack Images (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to combine multiple input images into a single image by stacking them either horizontally or vertically, based on the specified orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the orientation of the stacking process in the Stack Images (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The orientation of the stacking process in the Stack Images (mtb) node is determined by the 'vertical' parameter. If true, images are stacked vertically; otherwise, they are stacked horizontally."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Stack Images (mtb) node output and what is its Python dtype?",
        "answer": "The Stack Images (mtb) node outputs 'image' data, specifically a 'torch.Tensor', which represents the single image resulting from stacking the input images in the specified orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an essential requirement for using the Stack Images (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "An essential requirement for using the Stack Images (mtb) node in ComfyUI is the input of the 'vertical' parameter with the data type 'BOOLEAN' indicating the orientation of the stacking."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'IMAGE' data type in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the context of ComfyUI, the 'IMAGE' data type represents an image that can be processed or manipulated in various ways using custom nodes or plugins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Stack Images (mtb) node require for horizontal stacking?",
        "answer": "For horizontal stacking, the Stack Images (mtb) node requires all input tensors to have the same height."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Stack Images (mtb) node handle the normalization of input images to ensure they have 4 channels (RGBA)?",
        "answer": "The Stack Images (mtb) node normalizes input images to have 4 channels (RGBA) by either leaving them as is if they already have 4 channels, or adding an alpha channel if they have 3 channels (RGB)."
