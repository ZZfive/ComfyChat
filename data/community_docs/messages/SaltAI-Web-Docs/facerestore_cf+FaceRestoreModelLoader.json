        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node facilitates the loading and management of face restoration models, streamlining the initialization and configuration process for models required for face restoration tasks in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FaceRestoreModelLoader node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node belongs to the 'facerestore_cf' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'model_name' input in FaceRestoreModelLoader?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'model_name' input in FaceRestoreModelLoader is 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used in conjunction with the output of FaceRestoreModelLoader?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreCFWithModel node can be used in conjunction with the output of FaceRestoreModelLoader in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'model_name' input in FaceRestoreModelLoader?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' input in FaceRestoreModelLoader specifies the name of the face restoration model to be loaded, and is crucial for identifying and retrieving the correct model from a predefined list of available models for subsequent restoration tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of model does the FaceRestoreModelLoader node in ComfyUI return?",
        "answer": "The FaceRestoreModelLoader node in ComfyUI returns a face restoration model ready for use, with the dtype 'FACERESTORE_MODEL' which corresponds to the Python type 'torch.nn.Module'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FaceRestoreModelLoader handle the loading of a model with 'codeformer' in its name?",
        "answer": "When the 'model_name' includes 'codeformer', the FaceRestoreModelLoader loads the CodeFormer model specified, including setting up the model architecture and loading the pretrained parameters, evaluating the model ready for use."
