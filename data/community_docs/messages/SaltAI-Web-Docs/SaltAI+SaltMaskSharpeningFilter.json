        "question": "What is the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltMaskSharpeningFilter is a custom node in ComfyUI that applies a sharpening filter to a collection of masks, enhancing their edges and details based on a specified strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node requires masks as input, which is a collection of masks to be sharpened. The input type is Comfy dtype: MASK and Python dtype: torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node, and what does it define?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node is strength, which defines the intensity of the sharpening effect. A higher value results in a more pronounced sharpening effect on the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node is MASKS, which is a tensor of sharpened masks. The Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node enhance the details of masks in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node enhances the details of masks by iteratively applying a sharpening effect, making the features within the masks more pronounced according to the specified strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSharpeningFilter node has an infra type of GPU, indicating that it requires a GPU for optimal performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter functionality in the backend code?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSharpeningFilter functionality is implemented in the backend by the SaltMaskSharpeningFilter class."
