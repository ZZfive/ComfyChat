        "question": "What is Linear Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Linear Curve [Dream] is a class in ComfyUI that provides linear interpolation between an initial and a final value over a sequence of frames, commonly used for creating smooth transitions or animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Linear Curve [Dream] node interpolate?",
        "answer": "The Linear Curve [Dream] node interpolates values between an initial and a final value over a sequence of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Linear Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Linear Curve [Dream] node include 'frame_counter', 'initial_value', and 'final_value'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_counter' input do in the Linear Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_counter' input tracks the progression of frames, determining the current position in the interpolation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Linear Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Linear Curve [Dream] node include 'FLOAT' and 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Linear Curve [Dream] node compute the interpolated values?",
        "answer": "The Linear Curve [Dream] node computes the interpolated values using the formula: initial_value + frame_counter.progress * (final_value - initial_value)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the 'final_value' input correspond to?",
        "answer": "The 'final_value' input corresponds to the Python data type 'float'."
