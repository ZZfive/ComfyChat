        "question": "What class does ModelSamplingStableCascade belong to?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingStableCascade belongs to the `advanced/model` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ModelSamplingStableCascade do to models?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingStableCascade integrates advanced sampling techniques into models, potentially improving their performance or altering their behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ModelSamplingStableCascade?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ModelSamplingStableCascade include a `model` parameter of Comfy dtype `MODEL` and a `shift` parameter of Comfy dtype `FLOAT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `shift` parameter affect the sampling process in ModelSamplingStableCascade?",
        "answer": "The `shift` parameter in ModelSamplingStableCascade specifies the degree of shift applied during the sampling process, influencing how the model's behavior is altered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ModelSamplingStableCascade?",
        "answer": "The output type of ModelSamplingStableCascade is a `MODEL` with the stable cascade sampling patch applied."
