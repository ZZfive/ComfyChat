    {
        "question": "Can you specify the initial image that the CR Image Pipe In node should process?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can specify the initial image that the CR Image Pipe In node should process by providing an `image` input, which sets the starting point of the pipeline for the image processing in ComfyUI."
