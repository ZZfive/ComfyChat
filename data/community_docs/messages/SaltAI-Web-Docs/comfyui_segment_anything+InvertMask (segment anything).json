        "question": "What is the purpose of the InvertMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node in ComfyUI is designed for the inversion of mask values, effectively flipping the masked and unmasked areas in image processing tasks where the focus of interest needs to be switched between the foreground and background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type is required for the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node requires the 'mask' input, which represents the input mask whose values are to be inverted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InvertMask node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InvertMask node is 'mask', representing a mask with inverted values where previously masked areas are now unmasked and vice versa."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of operations can the InvertMask node facilitate in image processing?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node facilitates operations that require the opposite area of interest in image processing, such as toggling the areas of interest within an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which other nodes can be used in conjunction with the InvertMask node?",
        "answer": "Nodes that can be used in conjunction with the InvertMask node include MaskToImage, PorterDuffImageComposite, ImageCompositeMasked, VAEEncodeForInpaint, and FeatherMask."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the InvertMask node process the input 'mask' to produce the output?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node processes the input 'mask' by inverting its values through the operation out = 1.0 - mask to produce the output mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the InvertMask node in the ComfyUI node list?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node is categorized under 'segment_anything' in the ComfyUI node list."
