        "question": "What does ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative introduce to ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative introduces three new custom sampler nodes for ComfyUI, which are SamplerLCMAlternative, SamplerLCMCycle, and LCMScheduler. These nodes enhance the LCM sampler functions with additional parameters and functionalities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the features of the SamplerLCMAlternative node?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLCMAlternative node offers options for Euler steps, providing users with the ability to fine-tune their sampling process for more versatile and detailed results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SamplerLCMCycle node enhance the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLCMCycle node introduces cycle repetition of Euler and LCM sampling steps, allowing for the refinement of sample details and improved image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the LCMScheduler node in ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative?",
        "answer": "The LCMScheduler node in ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative is designed to inject randomness into the sampling process, enhancing the detail and quality of the images generated."
