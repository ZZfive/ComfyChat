        "question": "What is the Mikey Sampler Tiled node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler Tiled node in ComfyUI is designed for generating tiled samples in a structured manner, using advanced sampling techniques to ensure consistency and quality across tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the models required by the Mikey Sampler Tiled node for the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler Tiled node requires a base model and a refiner model for generating and refining the initial samples respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type does the variational autoencoder have in the Mikey Sampler Tiled node?",
        "answer": "In the Mikey Sampler Tiled node, the variational autoencoder (VAE) is of the Comfy dtype VAE and Python dtype torch.nn.Module."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the seed used in the Mikey Sampler Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The seed is used in the Mikey Sampler Tiled node for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the sampling process so that consistent tiles can be generated across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the resolution enhancement of the tiles in the Mikey Sampler Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The factor by which the tiles are upscaled, known as upscale_by, determines the resolution enhancement of the tiles, affecting the clarity and detail of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the denoising factor in the Mikey Sampler Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The denoising factor, tiler_denoise, helps in reducing noise and artifacts in the tiles generated by the Mikey Sampler Tiled node, improving the overall output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the Mikey Sampler Tiled node represented?",
        "answer": "The outputs of the Mikey Sampler Tiled node include the tiled_image and upscaled_image, both of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor, representing the final tiled image and the enhanced resolution version respectively."
