        "question": "What is the purpose of the MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node is designed for advanced sampling in a tiled manner, optimizing the generation process by handling complex patterns and structures efficiently."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameters specify the models used for initial tile generation and tile refinement in MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced?",
        "answer": "The 'base_model' parameter specifies the foundational model used for generating the initial set of tiles, while the 'refiner_model' parameter indicates the model used to refine the initially generated tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'positive_cond_base' and 'negative_cond_base' play in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_cond_base' specifies the positive conditioning for the base model, influencing the generation of initial tiles, while 'negative_cond_base' specifies the negative conditioning for the base model, also impacting the generation of initial tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'seed' parameter in MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced ensure reproducibility?",
        "answer": "By setting a specific seed value, the 'seed' parameter ensures the reproducibility of the generation process in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node so users can achieve consistent results across multiple runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the function of the 'upscale_by' parameter in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node.",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_by' parameter in MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced controls the upscaling factor, affecting the resolution and detail of the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'tiled_image' and what is its meaning in the context of MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced?",
        "answer": "The 'tiled_image' output in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced node is the result of the initial tiling process, providing a composite image made up of individual tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter can optionally replace the 'samples' input in MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced for increased flexibility in the generation process?",
        "answer": "The 'image_optional' parameter in MikeySamplerTiledAdvanced allows for an optional image input that, if provided, replaces the 'samples' input, offering flexibility in the generation process."
