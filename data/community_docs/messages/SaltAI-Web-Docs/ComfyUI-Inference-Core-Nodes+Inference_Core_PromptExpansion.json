        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance and expand input prompts using a pre-trained language model, automatically adjusting the input prompt based on a given seed to enrich it with additional context or variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with prompt expansion in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Inference_Core_PromptExpansion` class is associated with prompt expansion in ComfyUI, categorized under `utils`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node require to specify the model for prompt expansion?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node requires the `model_name` input, which specifies the model used for prompt expansion, determining the linguistic style and capabilities of the expansion."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, what format does the `seed` input of the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node take?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the `seed` input of the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node takes an integer format, influencing the variation in the expanded prompt and ensuring reproducibility of the expansion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `expanded_prompt` output defined in Inference_Core_PromptExpansion?",
        "answer": "The `expanded_prompt` output in Inference_Core_PromptExpansion is defined as the enriched and extended version of the original prompt, produced by incorporating additional context or variations based on the seed, with a Comfy dtype of `STRING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `log_prompt` input in the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The `log_prompt` input in the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node is a boolean flag that, when set to true, controls the logging of the original and expanded prompts for debugging or analysis purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which function is used to perform the prompt expansion in the `PromptExpansion` class within the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node?",
        "answer": "The `expand_prompt` function is used to perform the prompt expansion in the `PromptExpansion` class within the Inference_Core_PromptExpansion node, incorporating additional context or variations to the original prompt."
