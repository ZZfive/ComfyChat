        "question": "What is the Moondream Interrogator node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Moondream Interrogator node in ComfyUI is used to generate textual descriptions based on input images and prompts, leveraging the Moondream visual language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is essential for the Moondream Interrogator to generate textual descriptions?",
        "answer": "The Moondream Interrogator requires the input of an image tensor, a textual prompt, a separator string, a model_revision, a temperature setting, a device selection, and a trust_remote_code setting to generate textual descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Moondream Interrogator adjust to different model revisions?",
        "answer": "The Moondream Interrogator adjusts to different model revisions by enabling the selection of various model versions, which impacts the output variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of the `prompt` input in the Moondream Interrogator?",
        "answer": "The `prompt` input in the Moondream Interrogator influences the context and specificity of the textual descriptions generated for the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Moondream Interrogator node be run on both CPU and GPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Moondream Interrogator node can be run on both CPU and GPU, and the device selection impacts the performance and efficiency of the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Moondream Interrogator node generate multiple text descriptions for a single image?",
        "answer": "The Moondream Interrogator node generates multiple text descriptions for a single image by using a separator string to delineate between different generated texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `trust_remote_code` setting in the Moondream Interrogator do?",
        "answer": "The `trust_remote_code` setting in the Moondream Interrogator is a security feature that must be enabled to use remote code execution within the Moondream model, which is necessary for the node to function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Moondream Interrogator node output?",
        "answer": "The Moondream Interrogator node outputs a string of generated textual descriptions for the input image, influenced by the provided prompt and model settings."
