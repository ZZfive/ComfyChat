        "question": "What is ImageEffectsLensBokeh?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensBokeh is a class in ComfyUI that applies a bokeh effect to images, simulating the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageEffectsLensBokeh simulate?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensBokeh simulates the aesthetic quality of blur in out-of-focus areas of an image, mimicking real camera lens behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageEffectsLensBokeh?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageEffectsLensBokeh include 'images', 'blades_shape', 'blades_radius', 'blades_rotation', 'blur_size', 'blur_type', and 'method'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does blades_rotation affect ImageEffectsLensBokeh?",
        "answer": "blades_rotation in ImageEffectsLensBokeh determines the rotation angle of the lens blades, influencing the orientation of the bokeh blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of blades_shape in ImageEffectsLensBokeh?",
        "answer": "blades_shape in ImageEffectsLensBokeh defines the shape of the lens through which the bokeh effect is simulated, affecting the appearance of the blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the blur_size parameter control in ImageEffectsLensBokeh?",
        "answer": "blur_size in ImageEffectsLensBokeh sets the size of the blur effect, adjusting how prominent the bokeh effect appears in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageEffectsLensBokeh enhance images?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensBokeh enhances images by applying a bokeh effect that simulates lens characteristics and blur adjustments, improving visual appeal."
