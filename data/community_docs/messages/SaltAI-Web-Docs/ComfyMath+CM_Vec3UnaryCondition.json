        "question": "What is CM_Vec3UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryCondition is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to evaluate unary conditions on 3-dimensional vectors, providing a boolean result based on the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec3UnaryCondition belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryCondition belongs to the 'math/vec3' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_Vec3UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec3UnaryCondition specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector, determining the condition being evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'a' input represent in CM_Vec3UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in CM_Vec3UnaryCondition represents a 3-dimensional vector on which the unary condition is evaluated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec3UnaryCondition output its result?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3UnaryCondition outputs a boolean result, indicating whether the unary condition holds true for the given vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the inputs in CM_Vec3UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "In Python, the 'op' input is of type List[str], and the 'a' input is of type Vec3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code implementation of CM_Vec3UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The source code of CM_Vec3UnaryCondition includes a method 'op' that takes parameters 'op' and 'a' and returns a tuple containing a boolean result based on the evaluation of the unary condition."
