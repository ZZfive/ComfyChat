        "answer": "ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights is a class in ComfyUI under the category Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/weights that dynamically adjusts the weights of a control network based on a provided mask and specified minimum and maximum base multipliers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights?",
        "answer": "The purpose of ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights is to normalize and scale the weights of a control network, ensuring optimal performance by adjusting the weights according to a mask and specified scaling factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights requires inputs such as 'mask', which determines areas of influence within the control network; 'min_base_multiplier', specifying the minimum scaling factor for the weights; and 'max_base_multiplier', defining the maximum scaling factor for the weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights handle the 'mask' parameter?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights uses the 'mask' parameter to determine areas of influence within the control network. It normalizes and scales the weights based on this mask to adjust the network's influence dynamically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights outputs 'CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS', which represents the adjusted control network weights after applying the mask and scaling factors, and 'TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME', which encapsulates timestep keyframe information for integration into the model's processing flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights ensure normalized weights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights ensures normalized weights by using the 'min_base_multiplier' and 'max_base_multiplier' parameters. These parameters define the lower and upper bounds for scaling the weights, preventing them from falling below or exceeding specified thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter do in ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights?",
        "answer": "In ScaledSoftMaskedUniversalWeights, the 'mask' parameter determines specific areas of influence within the control network. It plays a crucial role in how the weights are adjusted and scaled to optimize the network's performance."
