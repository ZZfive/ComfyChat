        "question": "What is the purpose of the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to refine hand depth maps and predict 2D joint positions in image space using a Graphormer-based model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node provide?",
        "answer": "The MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node provides refined depth maps and masks corresponding to the detected hands in the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is required for the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node is the image, which is the input image to be processed for hand depth map refinement and 2D joint position prediction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask_bbox_padding' parameter do in the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_bbox_padding' parameter in the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node defines the padding around detected hand bounding boxes for mask generation, affecting the size and coverage of the output masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask_type' parameter in the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node affect the quality of the generated masks?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_type' parameter in the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node specifies the method for generating masks from the depth maps, offering options like 'based_on_depth' for depth-based masks, 'tight_bboxes' for masks based on tight bounding boxes, and 'original' for using the original mask, which affects the mask generation strategy and the final output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which other nodes in ComfyUI are commonly used in conjunction with the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes in ComfyUI in conjunction with the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node include the PreviewImage node and the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for using the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node is GPU."
