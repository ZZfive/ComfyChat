        "question": "What is ListStringToFloatNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ListStringToFloatNode is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to convert a string representation of a list into a float by performing a specified operation on the list elements, such as summing them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of ListStringToFloatNode?",
        "answer": "ListStringToFloatNode functions by handling both direct float values and lists of floats encapsulated as strings, converting them into a single float value for further data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ListStringToFloatNode?",
        "answer": "The required input type for ListStringToFloatNode is `input_data` of Comfy dtype `STRING`, which is a string input that can be either a direct float value or a string representation of a list of floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ListStringToFloatNode handle input data?",
        "answer": "ListStringToFloatNode attempts to evaluate the string input as a list. If the input data is a string, it is converted to a list before performing operations such as summing the elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the input data is not a list in ListStringToFloatNode?",
        "answer": "If the input data is not a list but a single string representation of a float, ListStringToFloatNode converts it to a float value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does ListStringToFloatNode output?",
        "answer": "ListStringToFloatNode outputs a single float value (`output_float`) of Comfy dtype `FLOAT`, resulting from the conversion and calculation performed on the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the ListStringToFloatNode classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ListStringToFloatNode is categorized under the 'Custom' category in ComfyUI."
