    {
        "question": "Which category does the GlobalSampler __Inspire node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSampler __Inspire node belongs to the 'InspirePack/Prompt' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input does the GlobalSampler __Inspire node require for specifying the sampler?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSampler __Inspire node requires the 'sampler_name' input, which specifies the sampler to be used, allowing selection from a variety of predefined sampling strategies within the Inspire Pack framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'sampler_name' input type classified in terms of Comfy dtype and Python dtype?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' input is classified as 'COMBO[STRING]' in terms of Comfy dtype and 'str' in terms of Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality of the 'scheduler' input in the GlobalSampler __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' input in the GlobalSampler __Inspire node determines the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, influencing the progression and quality of image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the GlobalSampler __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The GlobalSampler __Inspire node requires two inputs: 'sampler_name', which specifies the sampler to be used from a variety of strategies, and 'scheduler', which determines the method for controlling the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the GlobalSampler __Inspire node an output node in the Inspire Pack framework?",
        "answer": "Yes, the GlobalSampler __Inspire node is an output node, as indicated by the 'OUTPUT_NODE = True' in its source code."
