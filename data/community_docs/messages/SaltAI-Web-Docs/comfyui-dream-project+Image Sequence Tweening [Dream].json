        "question": "What is Image Sequence Tweening [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI designed to enhance animation sequences by interpolating additional frames between existing ones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] use to determine the number of frames to add?",
        "answer": "Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] uses a multiplier to determine the number of interpolated frames to add between each original frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required for Image Sequence Tweening [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The primary input required for Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] is the animation sequence to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] produce?",
        "answer": "Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] produces an enhanced animation sequence with additional tweened frames inserted between the original frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the smoothness of the resulting animation be controlled in Image Sequence Tweening [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The smoothness of the resulting animation in Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] can be controlled by adjusting the multiplier, which determines the number of interpolated frames added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] belong to?",
        "answer": "Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] belongs to the animation postprocessing category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the process function of Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] do?",
        "answer": "The process function of Image Sequence Tweening [Dream] generates extra frames based on the provided multiplier, enhancing the animation sequence by blending frames."
