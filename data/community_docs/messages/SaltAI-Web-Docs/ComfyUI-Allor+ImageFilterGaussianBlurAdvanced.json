        "question": "What is ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to apply an advanced Gaussian blur filter to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced belongs to the 'image/filter' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node applies a Gaussian blur filter to images with separate horizontal and vertical blur sizes and standard deviations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced include 'images' of type IMAGE, 'size_x' and 'size_y' of type INT specifying horizontal and vertical blur sizes, and 'sigma_x' and 'sigma_y' of type INT determining horizontal and vertical standard deviations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced node is a blurred image of type IMAGE, processed using the specified parameters for Gaussian blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does size_x affect the blurring in ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced?",
        "answer": "size_x in ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced specifies the horizontal size of the Gaussian kernel, influencing the extent of blurring along the x-axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does sigma_y determine in ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced?",
        "answer": "sigma_y in ImageFilterGaussianBlurAdvanced determines the vertical standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, affecting the spread of the blur along the y-axis."
