        "question": "What class is responsible for advanced CLIP text encoding for Stable Diffusion XL models in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` class is responsible for advanced CLIP text encoding for Stable Diffusion XL models in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node include `text_l`, `text_g`, `clip`, `token_normalization`, `weight_interpretation`, and `balance`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `text_l` input represent in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node?",
        "answer": "The `text_l` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node represents the local context text input, which allows for detailed specification of parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `balance` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node?",
        "answer": "The `balance` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node is a float value that determines the balance between local and global text embeddings in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What methods can be specified for the `token_normalization` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node?",
        "answer": "For the `token_normalization` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node, methods such as `none`, `mean`, `length`, and `length+mean` can be specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI deals with dual text inputs for local and global context for Stable Diffusion XL models?",
        "answer": "The `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node in ComfyUI deals with dual text inputs for local and global context for Stable Diffusion XL models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `weight_interpretation` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node influence?",
        "answer": "The `weight_interpretation` input in the `BNK_CLIPTextEncodeSDXLAdvanced` node influences the final embedding by adjusting the significance of certain tokens, affecting how weights are interpreted."
