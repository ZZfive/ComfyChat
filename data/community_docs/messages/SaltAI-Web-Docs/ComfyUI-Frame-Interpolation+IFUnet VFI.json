        "question": "What is IFUnet VFI designed for in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "IFUnet VFI is designed for video frame interpolation in ComfyUI, using deep learning models to predict and generate intermediate frames between existing frames in a video sequence to enhance video smoothness."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in IFUnet VFI determines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames?",
        "answer": "The 'multiplier' input parameter in IFUnet VFI determines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ckpt_name' input parameter specify in the IFUnet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' input parameter specifies the checkpoint name for the model to be used in the interpolation process, determining the specific pre-trained weights and configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the IFUnet VFI node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IFUnet VFI node can be found in the 'ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/VFI' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'ensemble' input parameter in the IFUnet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The 'ensemble' input parameter in the IFUnet VFI node is a boolean flag that indicates whether to use ensemble methods for interpolation, which can potentially improve the quality of the output frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the IFUnet VFI node generate?",
        "answer": "The IFUnet VFI node generates the output interpolated video frames, enhancing the smoothness and temporal resolution of the input video sequence. The output dtype is 'IMAGE' and the type in Python is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in the IFUnet VFI node controls memory usage during the interpolation process?",
        "answer": "The 'clear_cache_after_n_frames' input parameter controls how often the cache is cleared during the interpolation process, which manages memory usage effectively in the IFUnet VFI node."
