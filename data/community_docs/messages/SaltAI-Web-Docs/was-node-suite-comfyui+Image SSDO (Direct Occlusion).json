        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node is designed to simulate the effect of direct occlusion in images, enhancing the realism of 3D scenes by calculating how objects block light sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Filter` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node produce?",
        "answer": "The Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node produces 'composited_images', 'ssdo_images', 'ssdo_image_masks', and 'light_source_image_masks' as outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'strength' parameter control in the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter controls the intensity of the occlusion effect, allowing for fine-tuning of how pronounced the occlusion appears in the final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node?",
        "answer": "The input types required by the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node are images, depth_images, strength, radius, specular_threshold, and colored_occlusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node generate final images with the occlusion effect?",
        "answer": "The Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node generates final images with direct occlusion applied, showcasing enhanced depth and realism through the simulation of light blocking effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the 'ssdo_images' output of the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node be used for?",
        "answer": "The 'ssdo_images' output of the Image SSDO (Direct Occlusion) node can be used for further analysis or processing, as it represents the calculated occlusion effects for each image."
