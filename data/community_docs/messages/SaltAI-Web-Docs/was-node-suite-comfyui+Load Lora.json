        "question": "What is the purpose of the Load Lora node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load Lora node is designed to dynamically enhance the capabilities of machine learning models by applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments, allowing for fine-tuning of model and clip parameters without extensive retraining."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Load Lora node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Load Lora node are the original machine learning model (dtype: MODEL), clip parameter (dtype: CLIP), name of the LoRA adjustment file (dtype: COMBO[STRING]), strength of the LoRA adjustments for the model (dtype: FLOAT), and strength of the LoRA adjustments for the clip (dtype: FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Load Lora determine the intensity of adjustments applied to the model?",
        "answer": "Load Lora determines the intensity of adjustments applied to the model through the 'strength_model' input, which allows for fine-tuning the impact of LoRA adjustments on the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Load Lora node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Load Lora node is `Load Lora`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used alongside the Load Lora node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes alongside the Load Lora node include CLIPTextEncodeSDXL, PatchModelAddDownscale, FreeU_V2, and CLIPTextEncode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Load Lora node output, and what are their types?",
        "answer": "The Load Lora node outputs the enhanced version of the model (dtype: MODEL), the enhanced version of the clip parameter (dtype: CLIP), and the name of the LoRA adjustment applied (dtype: STRING)."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the Load Lora node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load Lora node is classified in the 'WAS Suite/Loaders' category in ComfyUI."
