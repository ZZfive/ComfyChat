        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI is designed to load a specific instance of the ScaleU model from a given filename for use in the instance diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI is `instance/loaders`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is LoadInstanceScaleUNode an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, LoadInstanceScaleUNode is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter is essential for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode and what does it specify?",
        "answer": "The parameter `model_filename` is essential for the LoadInstanceScaleUNode. It specifies the filename of the model to be loaded, determining which specific ScaleU model instance is retrieved for use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected data type of the `model_filename` input in the LoadInstanceScaleUNode when using ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "When using ComfyUI, the `model_filename` input in the LoadInstanceScaleUNode has a Comfy dtype of `COMBO[STRING]`, which is a combobox selecting a string value, usually a filename."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is returned by the LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadInstanceScaleUNode in ComfyUI returns a dictionary of type `Dict[str, List[torch.nn.Module]]` containing a list of ScaleU model instances under the key 'model_list'. This return data type has a Comfy dtype of `SCALEU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the dictionary returned by LoadInstanceScaleUNode contain?",
        "answer": "The dictionary returned by LoadInstanceScaleUNode contains a list of ScaleU model instances under the key 'model_list'. These models are prepared for integration into the instance diffusion framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LoadInstanceScaleUNode load the ScaleU model?",
        "answer": "The LoadInstanceScaleUNode loads the ScaleU model by using a checkpoint retrieval mechanism. It loads the model's state from the specified `model_filename` and prepares the ScaleU networks for subsequent use."
