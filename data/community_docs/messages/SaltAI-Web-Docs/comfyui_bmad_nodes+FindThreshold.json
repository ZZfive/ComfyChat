        "question": "What is the purpose of the FindThreshold custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindThreshold node in ComfyUI is designed to identify the optimal threshold value for image segmentation or binarization based on specific criteria, enhancing the adaptability and precision of image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'src' input in the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'src' input in the FindThreshold node is the source image on which thresholding needs to be applied, which is crucial for determining the optimal threshold value for segmentation or binarization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'downscale_factor' input control in the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'downscale_factor' input in the FindThreshold node controls by how much the image is downscaled, which can help in reducing the computational load during the threshold search process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs in the FindThreshold node define the threshold value search space?",
        "answer": "The 'start_at' and 'end_at' inputs in the FindThreshold node together define the range of threshold values to be considered, where 'start_at' provides the lower bound and 'end_at' sets the upper limit of the search space for the optimal threshold determination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FindThreshold node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the FindThreshold node in ComfyUI is the image after applying the optimal threshold value found, representing the segmented or binarized version of the source image."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the FindThreshold node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindThreshold node falls under the category 'Bmad/CV/Thresholding' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'condition' input allow in the FindThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'condition' input in the FindThreshold node allows the user to specify a condition that must be met by the thresholded image, which is used to evaluate and select the optimal threshold value."
