        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR XY Interpolate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Interpolate node in ComfyUI is designed for interpolating between two points or sets of points on an XY grid, facilitating the creation of smooth transitions or animations within a two-dimensional space."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the horizontal spread of points in the XY grid for the CR XY Interpolate node?",
        "answer": "The input that defines the horizontal spread of points in the XY grid for the CR XY Interpolate node is `x_columns`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `x_step` parameter control in the CR XY Interpolate node?",
        "answer": "The `x_step` parameter in the CR XY Interpolate node controls the step size for the X dimension, determining the increment between each point in the grid along the X axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of CR XY Interpolate specifies the vertical spread of points?",
        "answer": "The input that specifies the vertical spread of points for CR XY Interpolate is `y_rows`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CR XY Interpolate generate annotations for the Y dimension?",
        "answer": "CR XY Interpolate generates annotations for the Y dimension based on the 'y_annotation_prepend' input and interpolation parameters, providing a list of strings (`List[str]`) as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `index` input in CR XY Interpolate?",
        "answer": "The `index` input in CR XY Interpolate is used to specify a particular interpolation operation or sequence, which can be utilized to manage multiple interpolations within the same grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does CR XY Interpolate generate for interpolated values along the Y dimension?",
        "answer": "CR XY Interpolate generates a list of floats (`List[float]`) as the output type for interpolated values along the Y dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `show_help` output provide for CR XY Interpolate?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output for CR XY Interpolate provides a link to additional documentation or help related to the node and its usage, which is of type string (`str`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the transition smoothness between points in CR XY Interpolate?",
        "answer": "The `gradient_profile` parameter controls the transition smoothness between points in CR XY Interpolate."
