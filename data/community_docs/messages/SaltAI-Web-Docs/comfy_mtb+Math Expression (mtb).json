    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the Math Expression (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Math Expression (mtb) node is `expression`, a math expression string that can include placeholders for dynamic substitution and supports basic math operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Math Expression (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Math Expression (mtb) node are `result (float)`, the evaluated result of the math expression as a floating-point number, and `result (int)`, the evaluated result explicitly cast to an integer."

        "question": "What functionality does the function `eval_expression` in the Math Expression (mtb) node provide?",
        "answer": "The `eval_expression` function in the Math Expression (mtb) node evaluates a math expression string, replaces placeholders within the expression with values provided as arguments, and returns the evaluated result as both a float and an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if there is a syntax error in the math expression provided to the Math Expression (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "If there is a syntax error in the math expression provided to the Math Expression (mtb) node, a ValueError is raised, indicating that the expression syntax is incorrect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Math Expression (mtb) node replace the placeholder `<key>` with?",
        "answer": "The Math Expression (mtb) node replaces the placeholder `<key>` in the expression string with the corresponding value provided in arguments."
