        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeLoras custom node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoras custom node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to models within a generative AI framework, dynamically adjusting the LoRA stack based on input parameters for enhanced performance or specific outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SeargeLoras node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SeargeLoras node is `SeargeLoras`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeargeLoras node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeargeLoras node include `lora_i`, which specifies the LoRA's name (serving as a key identifier for applying specific LoRA adjustments), and `lora_i_strength`, which determines the strength of the LoRA's effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeLoras node handle optional data input?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoras node can optionally take in `data`, an optional data structure that can be provided to include additional context or parameters for the LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SeargeLoras node output?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoras node outputs `data`, which is an updated data structure including the modified LoRA stack, reflecting the applied LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the `lora_i_strength` input in the SeargeLoras node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `lora_i_strength` input in the SeargeLoras node is `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes used with SeargeLoras?",
        "answer": "The common nodes used with SeargeLoras are not specified in the documentation."
