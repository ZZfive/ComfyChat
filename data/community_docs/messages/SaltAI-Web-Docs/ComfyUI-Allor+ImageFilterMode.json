        "question": "What does the ImageFilterMode node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMode node applies a mode filter to images, which replaces each pixel's value with the most frequent value of its neighbors within a specified size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageFilterMode?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageFilterMode are 'images' of Comfy dtype IMAGE and Python dtype torch.Tensor, and 'size' of Comfy dtype INT and Python dtype int."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the size parameter affect ImageFilterMode?",
        "answer": "The size parameter in ImageFilterMode determines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel to consider for calculating the mode, thus affecting the extent of filtering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageFilterMode node return?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterMode node returns images after applying the mode filter, showcasing enhanced uniformity or reduced noise."
