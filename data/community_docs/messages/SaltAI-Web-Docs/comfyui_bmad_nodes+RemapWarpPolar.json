        "question": "What is the RemapWarpPolar node in ComfyUI designed for?",
        "answer": "The RemapWarpPolar node is designed to transform images by applying a warp polar effect, which includes adjustments for radius, center, and whether to apply the transformation in a logarithmic or linear fashion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the max_radius parameter do in the RemapWarpPolar node?",
        "answer": "The max_radius parameter in the RemapWarpPolar node specifies the maximum radius for the warp polar transformation, affecting how far from the center the effect extends."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you adjust the maximum radius of the warp polar effect in RemapWarpPolar?",
        "answer": "The maximum radius can be adjusted in RemapWarpPolar by using the max_radius parameter, which is specified as either a half of the minimum shape, a half of the maximum shape, hypot (using Pythagoras' theorem), or raw value controlled by the radius_adjust parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the center_x_adjust and center_y_adjust parameters in the RemapWarpPolar node?",
        "answer": "The center_x_adjust and center_y_adjust parameters in the RemapWarpPolar node adjust the center point of the transformation along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, allowing for horizontal and vertical shifting of the effect's origin."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the RemapWarpPolar node apply an inverse transformation to an image?",
        "answer": "Yes, the RemapWarpPolar node can apply an inverse transformation to an image when the 'inverse' parameter is enabled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the radius_adjust input type in the RemapWarpPolar node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the radius_adjust input type in the RemapWarpPolar node is set as a float in ComfyUI with a comfortable viewing range from 0.1 to 2048, and it is also a float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the log parameter in the RemapWarpPolar node determine?",
        "answer": "The log parameter in the RemapWarpPolar node determines whether the transformation should apply a logarithmic mapping, which alters the visual effect of the warp."
