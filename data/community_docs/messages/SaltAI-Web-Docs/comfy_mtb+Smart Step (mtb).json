        "question": "What is the Smart Step (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Smart Step (mtb) is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to manage the progression of steps within the KAdvancedSampler by calculating start and end points based on specified percentages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Smart Step (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Smart Step (mtb) node belongs to the 'mtb/conditioning' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'step' input parameter in the Smart Step (mtb) node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input parameter in the Smart Step (mtb) node specifies the current step count, which is used to calculate the starting and ending points of the sampling process based on percentage values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'start_percent' parameter expect in the Smart Step (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter in the Smart Step (mtb) node expects an integer type data that indicates the percentage at which the sampling process should start."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Smart Step (mtb) node calculate the 'start' output?",
        "answer": "The Smart Step (mtb) node calculates the 'start' output by determining the starting point of the sampling process as an integer value based on the provided 'step' and 'start_percent' inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'end_percent' parameter in the Smart Step (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'end_percent' parameter in the Smart Step (mtb) node sets the percentage at which the sampling process should end, enabling fine-tuned control over the sampling range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'do_step' function in the Smart Step (mtb) node source code do?",
        "answer": "The 'do_step' function in the Smart Step (mtb) node source code takes 'step', 'start_percent', and 'end_percent' as arguments and calculates the start and end points, returning them along with the original 'step' value."
