        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskContourExtraction node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskContourExtraction node is designed for extracting contours from mask regions using multiple threshold values, effectively highlighting their boundaries within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskContourExtraction node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskContourExtraction node is `masks`, which are the input masks for which contours are to be extracted, with a Comfy dtype of `MASK` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input does the SaltMaskContourExtraction node accept?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SaltMaskContourExtraction node is `thresholds`, a list of threshold values used to identify contours within the masks, with a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `List[int]`."
