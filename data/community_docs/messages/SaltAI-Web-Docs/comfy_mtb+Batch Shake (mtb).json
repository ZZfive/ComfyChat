        "question": "What is the Batch Shake (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Shake (mtb) node is used to apply a dynamic shaking effect to a batch of images in ComfyUI, simulating motion or instability effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Batch Shake (mtb) node modify the intensity of the shaking effect horizontally?",
        "answer": "The Batch Shake (mtb) node modifies the horizontal intensity of the shaking effect through the `position_amount_x` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter is crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo the shaking effect in the Batch Shake (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `images` input parameter is crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo the shaking effect in the Batch Shake (mtb) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the `rotation_amount` parameter in the Batch Shake (mtb) node and what is its purpose?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the `rotation_amount` parameter in the Batch Shake (mtb) node is `FLOAT`. It controls the amount of rotation applied to the images, simulating a twisting motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the Batch Shake (mtb) node influence the shaking effect's speed?",
        "answer": "The parameters `frequency` and `frequency_divider` in the Batch Shake (mtb) node influence the shaking effect's speed, with `frequency` defining the frequency and `frequency_divider` allowing for finer control over the speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Batch Shake (mtb) node produce after applying the shaking effect?",
        "answer": "After applying the shaking effect, the Batch Shake (mtb) node produces the processed image (`image`), the horizontal translation values (`pos_x`), the vertical translation values (`pos_y`), and the rotation values (`rot`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `octaves` parameter affect the shaking pattern in the Batch Shake (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `octaves` parameter in the Batch Shake (mtb) node adjusts the complexity of the shaking pattern, adding layers of motion for a more nuanced effect."
