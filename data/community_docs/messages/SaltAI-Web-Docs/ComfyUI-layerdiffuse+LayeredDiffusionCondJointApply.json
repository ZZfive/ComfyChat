        "question": "What is the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node in ComfyUI specializes in applying conditional and joint layered diffusion processes to generate or modify images based on specific conditions and joint configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node belongs to the 'layer_diffuse' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'model' in the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input is the model patcher used to apply the layered diffusion process, crucial for adapting the base model to specific configurations and conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node are 'model', 'image', and 'config'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which diffusion models can be selected using the 'config' input in the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'config' input allows you to specify the layered diffusion model to use by selecting from models such as 'layer_sd15_fg2bg.safetensors' or 'layer_sd15_bg2fg.safetensors'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'cond' input in the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node?",
        "answer": "The 'cond' input guides the diffusion process with conditional inputs, which are essential for tailoring the output to specific requirements or contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node output?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionCondJointApply node outputs a modified model after applying the layered diffusion process, reflecting the changes and enhancements made."
