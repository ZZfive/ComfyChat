        "question": "What is the CR Img2Img Process Switch node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Img2Img Process Switch node is designed to dynamically select between two different processing paths based on the input mode, specifically targeting image-to-image transformations. It facilitates the flexible integration of distinct processing pipelines within a single workflow, enhancing the adaptability of image manipulation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the processing path to be taken by the CR Img2Img Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The processing path to be taken by the CR Img2Img Process Switch node is determined by the 'Input' parameter, choosing between 'txt2img' and 'img2img' modes. This selection influences the subsequent processing steps and their outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'Input' parameter of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node accepts a 'COMBO[STRING]' datatype in ComfyUI, which is a combination of strings in the form of Union[str, Tuple[str]]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'txt2img' input parameter of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'txt2img' input parameter of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node specifies the latent representation to be used when the 'txt2img' mode is selected, enabling text-to-image conversion processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the CR Img2Img Process Switch node return when selecting the 'img2img' mode?",
        "answer": "When selecting the 'img2img' mode, the CR Img2Img Process Switch node returns a 'LATENT' output, which is the latent representation resulting from the image-to-image conversion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output of the CR Img2Img Process Switch node provides a URL to the help documentation for this node, offering additional information and guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name of the node 'CR Img2Img Process Switch'?",
        "answer": "The Python class name of the node 'CR Img2Img Process Switch' is 'CR_Img2ImgProcessSwitch'."
