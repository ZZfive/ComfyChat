        "question": "What does the MaskFromColor+ node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI generates a binary mask from an image, highlighting areas that match a specified RGB color within a given threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskFromColor+ node determine the areas to highlight in the mask?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromColor+ node determines areas to highlight by comparing the color within the input image against the specified red, green, and blue values within the threshold range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MaskFromColor+ node are the `image`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `threshold`, where `image` is the input image and `red`, `green`, and `blue` define the target color, and `threshold` specifies the tolerance level for color matching."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MaskFromColor+ node is `mask`, which is a binary mask that highlights areas of the input image matching the specified color within the given threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `threshold` input in the MaskFromColor+ node?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` input in the MaskFromColor+ node allows for a broader range of color variation to be considered a match, with a higher value allowing for more variation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can help generate masks based on color matching in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI can help generate masks based on color matching from an input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the MaskFromColor+ node in ComfyUI is `MaskFromColor+`."
