        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_MergeMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_MergeMasks node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two mask batches into a single batch, applying a specified merge strategy to handle size discrepancies and scaling between the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node categories does VHS_MergeMasks belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "VHS_MergeMasks belongs to the category `Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/mask` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `mask_A` input in the VHS_MergeMasks node?",
        "answer": "The `mask_A` input in the VHS_MergeMasks node represents the first mask batch to be merged. It plays a crucial role in determining the base template for merging when certain strategies are applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the merge_strategy input affect the merging process in VHS_MergeMasks?",
        "answer": "The `merge_strategy` input in VHS_MergeMasks defines the strategy for handling size discrepancies between the two mask batches, dictating whether to match the size of the first mask, the second mask, or the larger/smaller of the two."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data types are used to represent the inputs and outputs of the VHS_MergeMasks node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types used to represent the inputs `mask_A` and `mask_B` of the VHS_MergeMasks node are `torch.Tensor`, `merge_strategy` is of type `MergeStrategies`, `scale_method` is of type `ScaleMethods`, and `crop` is of type `CropMethods`. The outputs `MASK` and `count` are represented as `torch.Tensor` and `int` respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `scale_method` input in VHS_MergeMasks?",
        "answer": "The `scale_method` input in VHS_MergeMasks specifies the method to be used for scaling the masks during the merge process, ensuring that the masks are appropriately resized according to the merge strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node is used for the merge process of mask batches in ComfyUI's Video Helper Suite?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI's Video Helper Suite, the `VHS_MergeMasks` node is used for the merge process of mask batches."
