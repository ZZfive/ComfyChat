        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorFaceSwapOpt node is designed to offer optimized face swapping capabilities within the ReActor framework, providing advanced options for fine-tuning the face swap process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the enablement of the face swap operation in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The face swap operation in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node is enabled or disabled based on the `enabled` input, allowing users to toggle the functionality on demand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `input_image` play in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The `input_image` is the primary image input for the face swap operation in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node, serving as the target for face replacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node allow for face model customization?",
        "answer": "The ReActorFaceSwapOpt node allows for face model customization through the `swap_model`, which specifies the model used for swapping faces, `facedetection`, defining the face detection algorithm, and `face_model`, optionally specifying a face model to be used in the swap."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the blend between the original and restored face features in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node?",
        "answer": "The `face_restore_visibility` input controls the blend between the original and restored face features in the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node, adjusting the visibility level of the restored face details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes in ComfyUI can provide options for detailed face restoration?",
        "answer": "The ReActorFaceSwapOpt node in ComfyUI can provide options for detailed face restoration through its `face_restore_visibility` and `codeformer_weight` inputs, allowing control over the blend and impact of the restoration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node after a successful face swap?",
        "answer": "After a successful face swap, the ReActorFaceSwapOpt node outputs an `image` with the swapped faces integrated into the original image and a `face_model` used in the swapping process, ready for further operations or analysis."
