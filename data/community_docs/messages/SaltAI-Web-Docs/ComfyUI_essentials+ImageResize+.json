        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageResize+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageResize+ node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the size of an image to specified dimensions, providing a fundamental operation in image processing for preprocessing before further analysis or modification, and for adapting images to fit specific display or storage requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What image data type is expected for the 'image' input in ImageResize+?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in ImageResize+ expects image data of type `torch.Tensor`, as represented by Comfy dtype `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'interpolation' parameter affect the resizing process in ImageResize+?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' parameter in ImageResize+ defines the method used for resizing, which affects the quality and characteristics of the output image. Options include 'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'area', 'nearest-exact', and 'lanczos'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'keep_proportion' parameter do in ImageResize+?",
        "answer": "The 'keep_proportion' parameter in ImageResize+ determines whether the original aspect ratio of the image should be preserved during resizing. When set to true, the operation maintains the aspect ratio of the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter ensures that the dimensions of the resized image in ImageResize+ are multiples of a specified value?",
        "answer": "The 'multiple_of' parameter in ImageResize+ ensures the dimensions of the resized image are multiples of a specified value, which can be useful for certain processing or model input requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output types does ImageResize+ provide?",
        "answer": "ImageResize+ provides output types including `IMAGE` for the resized image, `INT` for the actual width and height of the resized image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with ImageResize+?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes with ImageResize+ include SetNode, SVD_img2vid_Conditioning, and PrepImageForClipVision, which are part of the ComfyUI ecosystem."
