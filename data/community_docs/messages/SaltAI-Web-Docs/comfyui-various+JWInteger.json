        "question": "Which category does the JWInteger node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWInteger node belongs to the category of `jamesWalker55` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for JWInteger node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The required input for the JWInteger node is the `value` parameter, which specifies the integer value to be encapsulated by the node, directly representing the data the node operates on."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of value does the JWInteger node output and how is it represented in Comfy and Python?",
        "answer": "The JWInteger node outputs the encapsulated integer value, with the Comfy dtype as `INT` and the Python dtype as `int`."
    },
    {
