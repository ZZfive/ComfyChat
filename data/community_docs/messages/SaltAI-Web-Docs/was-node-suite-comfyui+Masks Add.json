        "question": "What is the Masks Add node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Masks Add node in ComfyUI is designed to perform addition operations on mask data, effectively combining or layering two masks together."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Masks Add node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Masks Add node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types accepted by the Masks Add node?",
        "answer": "The Masks Add node accepts two required input types: 'masks_a' and 'masks_b', both of type 'MASK' in ComfyUI and 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the dimensions of 'masks_a' and 'masks_b' are different in the Masks Add node?",
        "answer": "If the dimensions of 'masks_a' and 'masks_b' are different, their shapes are adjusted before the addition operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Masks Add node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Masks Add node is a single 'MASK' type, which is the result of adding two sets of masks and can be used for further image processing or analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'masks_a' represent in the Masks Add node?",
        "answer": "'masks_a' represents the first set of masks to be added in the Masks Add node, serving as one of the two primary inputs for the addition operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'masks_b' represent in the Masks Add node?",
        "answer": "'masks_b' represents the second set of masks to be added alongside 'masks_a' in the Masks Add node, contributing significantly to the final combined mask result."
