        "question": "What is the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node is designed to extract a sequence of images from a batch based on specified start and stop indices, optionally including the stop index in the extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node belongs to the 'jamesWalker55' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'images' input parameter in the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'images' input parameter in the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inclusive' parameter control in the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'inclusive' parameter is a flag that indicates whether the stop index should be included in the extraction, allowing for flexible endpoint inclusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'i_start' parameter represent in the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node?",
        "answer": "The 'i_start' parameter represents an integer ('INT') that is the start index for the sequence extraction, determining the first image in the sequence to be included."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node when executed?",
        "answer": "The JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch node, when executed, returns a tensor ('torch.Tensor') representing the extracted sequence of images as the 'image' output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'execute' method in the JWImageSequenceExtractFromBatch nodeâ€™s source code?",
        "answer": "The 'execute' method in the source code is responsible for loading images based on the given parameters such as 'path_pattern', 'start_index', 'frame_count', and 'ignore_missing_images'."
