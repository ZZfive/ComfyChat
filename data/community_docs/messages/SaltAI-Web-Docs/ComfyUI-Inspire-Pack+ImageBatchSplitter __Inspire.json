        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node is designed to split a batch of images into smaller batches or individual images based on a specified split count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node requires two inputs: `images`, which is a collection of images to be split, and `split_count`, which specifies the number of splits or individual images to extract from the input batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire handle scenarios where the requested split count exceeds the number of available images?",
        "answer": "If the requested split count exceeds the number of available images, ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire pads the output with empty images, ensuring the output always matches the requested size."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node categorized in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node is categorized under 'InspirePack/Util' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'images' input in the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node is of dtype 'IMAGE', which is a list of torch.Tensor objects in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'split_count' input in the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'split_count' input in the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node is of dtype 'INT', which is an int in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the COMPY dtype of 'IMAGE' signify in the context of the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The COMPY dtype of 'IMAGE' signifies the input of images in the context of the ImageBatchSplitter __Inspire node, specifically a list of torch.Tensor objects representing the images to be split."
