        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConvertImg node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConvertImg node in ComfyUI is designed for explicit image format conversion, allowing users to convert images to specific formats required by certain custom nodes without the need for workarounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input parameter represent in the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter in the ConvertImg node represents the input image that needs to be converted. It has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What formats can the 'to' parameter specify in the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The 'to' parameter in the ConvertImg node can specify the target image format for conversion. The available formats are 'RGBA', 'RGB', and 'GRAY'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ConvertImg node is an image that has been converted to the specified format. The output also has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the ConvertImg node categorized in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The ConvertImg node is categorized under the 'Bmad/CV' section in ComfyUI's node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can benefit from the use of ConvertImg for image format conversion?",
        "answer": "Certain custom nodes in ComfyUI that require specific image formats can benefit from using the ConvertImg node to ensure the image format matches their requirements without needing any workarounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for running the ConvertImg node?",
        "answer": "The ConvertImg node requires an 'GPU' (Graphics Processing Unit) infrastructure type for its execution."
