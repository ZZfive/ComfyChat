        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Gradient Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Gradient Float node in ComfyUI is designed for creating smooth transitions between two float values over a specified number of frames, based on a given gradient profile, facilitating dynamic visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `start_value` input represent in the CR Gradient Float node?",
        "answer": "The `start_value` input in the CR Gradient Float node represents the starting float value of the gradient transition, marking the beginning of the interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `gradient_profile` input in the CR Gradient Float node?",
        "answer": "The `gradient_profile` input in the CR Gradient Float node is a profile defining the nature of the gradient transition, influencing the interpolation calculation. Currently, it only supports 'Lerp' as the gradient profile."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Gradient Float node output besides the interpolated float value?",
        "answer": "Besides the interpolated float value, the CR Gradient Float node outputs a URL to a help page providing additional information and guidance on using the gradient interpolation node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the interpolated float value calculated for the current frame?",
        "answer": "The interpolated float value for the current frame is calculated by determining the current step within the frame duration, then applying the linear interpolation formula which is a function of the `start_value`, `end_value`, and the `current_frame`'s position relative to the `start_frame` and `frame_duration`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category of nodes can you find CR Gradient Float in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Gradient Float can be found in the 'Comfyroll Studio/Animation/Interpolate' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output `show_help` in the CR Gradient Float node provide?",
        "answer": "The output `show_help` in the CR Gradient Float node provides a URL to a help page that offers additional information and guidance on using the gradient interpolation node."
