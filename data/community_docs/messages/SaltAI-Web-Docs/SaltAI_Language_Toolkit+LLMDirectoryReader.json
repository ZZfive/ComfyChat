        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMDirectoryReader node in ComfyUI's SALT/Language Toolkit/Readers category?",
        "answer": "The LLMDirectoryReader node is designed to read and process directories, efficiently handling and organizing the contents into a structured format suitable for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_directory' parameter specify in the LLMDirectoryReader node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_directory' parameter specifies the path to the directory to be read, serving as the starting point for the node's directory traversal and content extraction operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'optional_path_list' parameter do in the LLMDirectoryReader node?",
        "answer": "The 'optional_path_list' parameter is a list of specific paths within the directory to focus on. This can refine the reading process to target particular files or subdirectories, potentially optimizing performance and relevance of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'recursive' parameter affect the reading operation in the LLMDirectoryReader node?",
        "answer": "The 'recursive' parameter is a boolean flag that determines whether the reading operation should recursively traverse subdirectories. Enabling this can significantly affect the depth and comprehensiveness of the directory reading process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter allows the LLMDirectoryReader node to filter the files by file extensions?",
        "answer": "The 'required_ext_list' parameter defines a list of file extensions to include in the reading process. This filters the files to be processed, directly influencing the node's output by limiting it to files of specified types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can be achieved by using the 'exclude_glob_list' parameter in the LLMDirectoryReader node?",
        "answer": "The 'exclude_glob_list' parameter specifies patterns to exclude from the reading process. This can prevent certain files or directories from being processed, tailoring the output to exclude irrelevant or sensitive information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the LLMDirectoryReader node return?",
        "answer": "The LLMDirectoryReader node returns a structured representation of the contents read from the directory, typically organized in a way that facilitates further analysis or processing."
