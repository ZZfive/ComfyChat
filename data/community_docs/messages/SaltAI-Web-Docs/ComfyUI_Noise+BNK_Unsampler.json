        "question": "What is the purpose of the BNK_Unsampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_Unsampler node in ComfyUI is designed to reverse the sampling process, allowing for the manipulation or refinement of latent images through specific configurations and steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which generative model does the BNK_Unsampler node use for the unsampling process?",
        "answer": "The BNK_Unsampler node uses the generative model specified by the `model` input, which is central to determining the transformation applied to the latent image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sampler_name` input define in the BNK_Unsampler node?",
        "answer": "The `sampler_name` input in the BNK_Unsampler node determines the sampling strategy to be employed, which affects how the latent image is processed during unsampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BNK_Unsampler node handle normalization of the latent image?",
        "answer": "The BNK_Unsampler node can apply normalization to the latent image during the unsampling process if the `normalize` input is set to `enable`, which affects the output's characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `cfg` input play in the BNK_Unsampler node?",
        "answer": "The `cfg` input in the BNK_Unsampler node is a configuration parameter that influences the unsampling behavior, potentially adjusting aspects like the strength or direction of the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BNK_Unsampler node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BNK_Unsampler node is the transformed latent image, which results from the unsampling process and reflects the applied configurations and steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What scheduling algorithm is used by the BNK_Unsampler node?",
        "answer": "The BNK_Unsampler node uses the scheduling algorithm specified by the `scheduler` input to control the progression of steps in the unsampling process."
