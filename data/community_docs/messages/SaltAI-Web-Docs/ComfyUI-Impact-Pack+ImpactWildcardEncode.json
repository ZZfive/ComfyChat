        "question": "What is the ImpactWildcardEncode node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactWildcardEncode node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically replace placeholders within a string with actual values based on predefined rules and dictionaries, enabling the generation of customized and varied outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactWildcardEncode class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactWildcardEncode class is categorized under 'ImpactPack/Prompt' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters are required for the ImpactWildcardEncode node and what is their role?",
        "answer": "The required parameters for the ImpactWildcardEncode node include 'model', 'clip', 'wildcard_text', 'populated_text', 'mode', 'Select to add LoRA', 'Select to add Wildcard', and 'seed'. These serve roles such as specifying the model to be used, the clip to provide additional context, the input string with placeholders to be replaced, the resulting populated text, the operation mode, LoRA selection, wildcard selection, and controlling the randomness of replacements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ImpactWildcardEncode node provide in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactWildcardEncode node in ComfyUI outputs 'model', 'clip', 'conditioning', and 'populated_text'. These outputs represent the potentially modified or selected model and clip parameters, additional conditioning information, and the text with placeholders replaced by actual values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the seed parameter influence the output of the ImpactWildcardEncode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter in the ImpactWildcardEncode node influences the randomness of wildcard replacements, ensuring reproducibility or variation in outputs. It is represented by the dtype int and is crucial for controlling how wildcards are replaced within the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes work well with the ImpactWildcardEncode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that work well with the ImpactWildcardEncode node in ComfyUI include KSampler, Reroute, CLIPTextEncode, FaceDetailer, and ControlNetApplyAdvanced. These nodes can be used in conjunction with ImpactWildcardEncode for more dynamic text processing and generation capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python function is used to process the logic of the ImpactWildcardEncode node?",
        "answer": "The logic of the ImpactWildcardEncode node is processed using the 'doit' function, which utilizes the 'process_with_loras' function from the 'impact.wildcards' module to generate the populated text based on the inputs provided."
