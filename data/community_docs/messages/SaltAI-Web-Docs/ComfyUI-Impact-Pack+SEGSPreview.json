        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSPreview node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPreview node in ComfyUI is designed to generate previews of segmentation images, focusing on the control network aspect of these images. It processes a batch of segmentation data, extracting and saving control network images for each segment, and returns a list of these images along with their metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'segs' parameter and what does it represent in the SEGSPreview node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' parameter in the SEGSPreview node represents the segmentation data to be processed. It is crucial for generating the control network images and their previews, as it contains the necessary information for each segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'alpha_mode' parameter have in the SEGSPreview node?",
        "answer": "The 'alpha_mode' parameter in the SEGSPreview node determines the mode of alpha blending used in the preview generation, affecting the transparency and overlay of images. It can be set to 'enable' (True) or 'disable' (False)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'min_alpha' parameter in the SEGSPreview node?",
        "answer": "The 'min_alpha' parameter in the SEGSPreview node specifies the minimum alpha value for transparency in the preview images, controlling the visibility of underlying layers. It can be set between 0.0 and 1.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional parameter 'fallback_image_opt' do in the SEGSPreview node?",
        "answer": "The 'fallback_image_opt' parameter in the SEGSPreview node is an optional fallback image to use when segmentation data is incomplete or missing, ensuring a default visual is available."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of images are returned as output by the SEGSPreview node?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPreview node returns images with the Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE', which represents the final image or images generated by the node, encapsulating the visual result of the processing. The Python dtype for the returned images is 'List[Image]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'ui' parameter in the output of the SEGSPreview node and what does it contain?",
        "answer": "The 'ui' parameter in the output of the SEGSPreview node contains the results of the operation. It includes a list of images generated from the segmentation data, each with its filename, subfolder, and type."
