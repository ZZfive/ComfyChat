        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWFloatMul node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMul node in ComfyUI is designed to perform multiplication between two floating-point numbers, offering a simple method to scale or combine numerical values within a floating-point context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the JWFloatMul node?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMul node requires two input types: 'a', which is the first floating-point number to be multiplied, and 'b', the second floating-point number to be multiplied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'a' input represent in the JWFloatMul node and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in the JWFloatMul node represents the first floating-point number to be multiplied. Its data type in Comfy is FLOAT, and in Python, it is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'b' input represent in the JWFloatMul node and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The 'b' input in the JWFloatMul node represents the second floating-point number to be multiplied. Its data type in Comfy is FLOAT, and in Python, it is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the JWFloatMul node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWFloatMul node represents the result of multiplying the two input floating-point numbers, returned as a single floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the infra types supported by the JWFloatMul node?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMul node supports CPU as the infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWFloatMul node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWFloatMul node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
