        "question": "What is the ImpactSleep node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSleep node in ComfyUI introduces a delay in the execution flow by pausing for a specified number of seconds, which can be useful for timing operations or creating a pause in a sequence of actions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the ImpactSleep node is `ImpactSleep`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the ImpactSleep node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSleep node is categorized under `ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `signal` input in the ImpactSleep node do?",
        "answer": "The `signal` input in the ImpactSleep node acts as a pass-through, allowing the node to be integrated into a flow without affecting the data being transmitted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `seconds` input in the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The `seconds` input specifies the duration of the sleep period in seconds, determining how long the execution will pause before continuing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `signal_opt` output of the ImpactSleep node represent?",
        "answer": "The `signal_opt` output of the ImpactSleep node represents the same signal that was input, effectively acting as a pass-through after the specified sleep duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type of the ImpactSleep node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type of the ImpactSleep node is `CPU`."
