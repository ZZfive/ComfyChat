        "question": "What is the ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node is used for creating and configuring view options to generate animations with uniform distribution. It allows customization of view length, stride, and overlap, along with the method of fusing context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the granularity and extent of the animation frames generated by ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions?",
        "answer": "The granularity and extent of the animation frames generated by ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions is determined by the 'view_length' input, which specifies the length of the view."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter controls the smoothness and speed of the animation in the ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node?",
        "answer": "The 'view_stride' parameter in the ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node controls the smoothness and speed of the animation, by determining the stride between views."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'view_overlap' in ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions?",
        "answer": "The 'view_overlap' parameter in ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions is used to set the overlap between views, which helps in creating smoother transitions between animation frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'fuse_method' input in ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions impact the animation?",
        "answer": "The 'fuse_method' input in ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions impacts the animation by defining the method used to fuse multiple contexts together, which affects the continuity and coherence of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the 'view_length', 'view_stride', and 'view_overlap' inputs in the ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node?",
        "answer": "The data types of 'view_length', 'view_stride', and 'view_overlap' inputs in the ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions node are 'INT' in Comfy dtype and 'int' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions, how are the view options formatted for output?",
        "answer": "In ADE_StandardUniformViewOptions, the view options are formatted as output type 'view_opts', which is of dtype 'VIEW_OPTS' in Comfy and is an instance of the 'ContextOptions' class in Python."
