    {
        "question": "What is the 'signal' input used for in the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' input in the ImpactQueueTrigger node is a generic input signal that triggers the operation of the node and initiates the execution flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactQueueTrigger node handle the 'signal' input?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' input in the ImpactQueueTrigger node is passed through, allowing for the continuation of the execution flow without any change."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactQueueTrigger node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactQueueTrigger node is 'signal_opt', which is the same as the input 'signal' type, allowing for the continuation of the execution flow in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the ImpactQueueTrigger node designed for?",
