        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node is designed to toggle between enabling and disabling states based on specific conditions, facilitating dynamic control flows within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node and what do they do?",
        "answer": "The 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node requires three inputs: 'select', 'compare', and 'match'. 'select' and 'compare' are integer inputs that are compared to determine the switch state. 'match' is a predefined condition that dictates whether the switch should be set to enable or disable based on the comparison of 'select' and 'compare' inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node outputs a single value under the type 'enable_disable', which represents the state of the switch ('enable' or 'disable') determined by the input conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'compare' input in the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'compare' input in the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node is 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node, what are the options for the 'match' input and how do they influence the output state?",
        "answer": "The 'match' input in the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node has two options: 'Set to Enable' and 'Set to Disable'. 'Set to Enable' activates the switch when 'select' equals 'compare', and 'Set to Disable' deactivates the switch under the same condition, the opposite occurs when the 'select' does not equal 'compare'."

    {
        "question": "Which nodes can dynamically control the flow of a process in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node is one of the nodes that can dynamically control the flow of a process in ComfyUI by toggling the switch state based on input conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output state 'enable_disable' determined in the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node?",
        "answer": "The output state 'enable_disable' in the 'Enable Disable Switch (JPS)' node is determined by the comparison of 'select' and 'compare' inputs against the predefined condition 'match'; whether they should equal for 'enable' or 'disable' output depends on the 'match' value."
