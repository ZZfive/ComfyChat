        "question": "What is the CreateVoronoiMask node in ComfyUI for?",
        "answer": "The CreateVoronoiMask node is designed to generate dynamic Voronoi diagram-based masks, utilizing parameters such as the number of points, line width, and animation speed to create visually distinct and animated masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CreateVoronoiMask node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateVoronoiMask node belongs to the 'KJNodes/masking/generate' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in CreateVoronoiMask determines the animation speed of the mask?",
        "answer": "The speed parameter in CreateVoronoiMask controls the animation speed of the mask, enabling the adjustment of how quickly the mask evolves over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the mask generated by the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the mask generated by the CreateVoronoiMask node is `MASK`, which is represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you specify the width and height of the mask frame in CreateVoronoiMask?",
        "answer": "Yes, in CreateVoronoiMask, the frame_width and frame_height parameters specify the width and height of the frame for the mask, setting the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the frames and num_points parameters in CreateVoronoiMask node affect?",
        "answer": "The frames parameter in the CreateVoronoiMask node specifies the number of frames for the animated mask, while the num_points parameter determines the number of points used to generate the Voronoi diagram, both affecting the complexity and dynamics of the generated mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the CreateVoronoiMask node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure requirement for the CreateVoronoiMask node is `GPU`, which is used for processing the images and animations."
