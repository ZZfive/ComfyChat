        "question": "What is the class name for the node that performs content shuffle preprocessing in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that performs content shuffle preprocessing is `Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor is a ControlNet Preprocessors/T2IAdapter-only node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is to preprocess images by applying a content shuffle operation, which detects and potentially rearranges elements within an image for content manipulation or augmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is necessary for Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor to function?",
        "answer": "A required input for Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor is an `image`; it is the primary input for the content shuffle operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `resolution` input in the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` input specifies the resolution to which the image should be resized before processing, impacting the granularity of the shuffle operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the shuffle effect be reproduced in different runs using Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor, and if so, how?",
        "answer": "Yes, the shuffle effect can be reproduced across different runs by specifying the same `seed` value, which determines the random number generator used in the shuffle operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output generated by the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output generated by the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is the `image` after the content shuffle operation has been applied, ready for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node designed to work specifically with images?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Inference_Core_ShufflePreprocessor node is designed specifically for image preprocessing, as indicated by the 'Image' tag associated with it."
