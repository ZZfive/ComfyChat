        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageApplyLUT+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageApplyLUT+ node in ComfyUI is used to apply a Look-Up Table (LUT) to an image or a batch of images to adjust their colors, optionally applying color space transformations and blending the original images with their LUT-applied versions based on a specified strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input represent in the ImageApplyLUT+ node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in the ImageApplyLUT+ node represents the image or batch of images to which the LUT will be applied. This input is crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo color transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting `log_colorspace` to true in the ImageApplyLUT+ node?",
        "answer": "Setting `log_colorspace` to true in the ImageApplyLUT+ node indicates that a logarithmic color space transformation should be applied to the images before and after applying the LUT, enhancing the effect of the LUT under certain conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `clip_values` in the ImageApplyLUT+ node?",
        "answer": "The `clip_values` in the ImageApplyLUT+ node is a boolean flag that specifies whether to clip the color values of the images to fit within the LUT's domain, ensuring that the output colors are valid within the specified color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `strength` input in ImageApplyLUT+ determine the output of the images?",
        "answer": "The `strength` input in ImageApplyLUT+ is a floating-point value that determines the blend strength between the original images and their LUT-applied versions, allowing for subtle to significant alterations in the image's appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the ImageApplyLUT+ node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImageApplyLUT+ node produces the transformed images after applying the LUT, optional color space transformation, and blending based on the specified strength, showcased as the final stylized or color-corrected images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the ImageApplyLUT+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageApplyLUT+ node in ComfyUI is implemented by the `ImageApplyLUT` class."
