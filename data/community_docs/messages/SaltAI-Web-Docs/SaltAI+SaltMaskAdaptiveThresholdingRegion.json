        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node falls under the category of SALT/Masking/Filter in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node in ComfyUI applies adaptive thresholding to a set of mask images, converting them into binary images based on local pixel value variations to enhance feature visibility in regions with varying illumination."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is necessary for the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node to function?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node requires the input of masks to process for adaptive thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the block size of the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node defined?",
        "answer": "The block size in the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node is defined as the size of the local region around each pixel to calculate its threshold value, determining the adaptability of the thresholding process to local changes in illumination. It is an optional input, defaulting to 11, with a range from 3 to 255."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'constant' parameter play in the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'constant' parameter in the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node is a value subtracted from the mean or weighted mean calculated over the block size, which fine-tunes the thresholding process. It is an optional input, defaulting to 2, with a range from 0 to 10."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node outputs MASKS, which is a tensor containing the regions after applying adaptive thresholding, enhancing local features in the masks. The output data type is a 'torch.Tensor' representing binary images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input masks in the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The input masks in the SaltMaskAdaptiveThresholdingRegion node are of type 'MASK' in Comfy data dtype and are represented as List[torch.Tensor] in Python dtype."
