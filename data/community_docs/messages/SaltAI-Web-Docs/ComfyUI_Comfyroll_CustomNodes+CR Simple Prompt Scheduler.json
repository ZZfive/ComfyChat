        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Prompt Scheduler node is designed to manage and schedule animation prompts based on a simple scheduling logic. It processes a list of keyframes and prepares a sequence of prompts for animation frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of scheduling modes does the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler support?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Prompt Scheduler supports different scheduling modes, including default prompts and keyframe lists, and can handle format conversions for compatibility with different animation systems."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'keyframe_list' input in the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_list' input defines the sequence and timing of animation prompts, influencing the scheduling outcome and the generation of animation prompts. It's crucial for the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'current_frame' input affect the output of the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input determines the relevant prompt and keyframe information for the current point in the animation sequence, affecting the scheduled prompts for the current frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'keyframe_format' input in the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_format' input specifies the format of the keyframes, allowing for conversion between different animation systems' formats to ensure compatibility and correct interpretation of the keyframe list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the outputs of the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The CR Simple Prompt Scheduler node outputs the 'current_prompt', 'next_prompt', 'weight', and 'show_help'. The 'current_prompt' and 'next_prompt' are scheduled strings for the current and next frames respectively, 'weight' is a float indicating the relevance of the current prompt, and 'show_help' is a URL to documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler, what happens if no lines are present in the keyframe list?",
        "answer": "If no lines are present in the keyframe list, the CR Simple Prompt Scheduler prints an error message indicating no lines are found and returns an empty tuple."
