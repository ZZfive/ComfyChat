        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Image List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Image List node in ComfyUI is designed to load and process a list of images from a specified directory, converting them into a format suitable for further manipulation or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the CR Image List node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Image List node provides an output of 'IMAGE_LIST', which is a list of images that have been loaded and converted to a consistent format, ready for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'image_list' in the CR Image List node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_list' parameter in the CR Image List node allows for the bulk loading and processing of images, accommodating larger sets of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CR Image List node process more than one image at a time?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CR Image List node can process multiple images through the use of parameters like 'image_1', 'image_2', etc., each with an optional associated alias such as 'alias1', 'alias2', etc."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the aliases 'alias1', 'alias2', etc., represent in the CR Image List node?",
        "answer": "In the CR Image List node, the aliases 'alias1', 'alias2', etc., provide a means to reference each loaded image more conveniently in subsequent operations, making it easier to identify and work with each image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types supported by the CR Image List node?",
        "answer": "The CR Image List node supports 'IMAGE_LIST' as the primary output type which is a list of torch.Tensors representing the loaded and processed images, and 'STRING' type data as 'show_help' to provide a link to helpful documentation or resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Image List convert images to a consistent format?",
        "answer": "Although the exact process is not detailed, the CR Image List node performs necessary conversions on the input images to ensure that they are in a consistent format suitable for further processing or analysis."
