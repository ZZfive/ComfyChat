        "question": "What is the SaltLoadAudio node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltLoadAudio node in ComfyUI is designed to load audio files into the system, serving as the initial step in the audio handling pipeline and preparing audio data for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltLoadAudio node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltLoadAudio node include `file_path` (STRING), `start_seconds` (FLOAT), `manual_bpm` (FLOAT), and `frame_rate` (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltLoadAudio node handle the selection of audio segments for processing?",
        "answer": "The SaltLoadAudio node allows for the selection of audio segments through the `start_seconds` and optional `duration_seconds` inputs, enabling partial loading of audio files for focused analysis or manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `manual_bpm` input in the SaltLoadAudio node?",
        "answer": "The `manual_bpm` input in the SaltLoadAudio node allows for the manual specification of beats per minute, overriding automatic BPM detection and providing precise tempo information for audio processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI would you use to load audio data for further processing?",
        "answer": "You would use the SaltLoadAudio node in ComfyUI to load audio data for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the SaltLoadAudio node return in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltLoadAudio node returns the following output types in ComfyUI: `audio` (AUDIO), `bpm` (FLOAT), `frame_rate` (INT), and `frame_count` (INT), which are the loaded audio data, beats per minute, frame rate used during loading, and total number of frames in the loaded segment, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for the output type `audio` in the SaltLoadAudio node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for the `audio` output type in the SaltLoadAudio node is `bytes`."
