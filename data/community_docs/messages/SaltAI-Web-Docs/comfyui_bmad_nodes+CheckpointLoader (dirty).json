        "question": "What is CheckpointLoader (dirty) intended for?",
        "answer": "CheckpointLoader (dirty) is designed to load model checkpoints flexibly, accommodating potentially mismatched or incomplete filenames, and is part of the 'Bmad/api/dirty loaders' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CheckpointLoader (dirty)?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CheckpointLoader (dirty) are 'config_name' (STRING) and 'ckpt_name' (STRING), which are crucial for loading the model's configuration and weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What utility functions are employed by CheckpointLoader (dirty)?",
        "answer": "CheckpointLoader (dirty) employs utility functions to find the best match for potentially mismatched or incomplete filenames, aiding in the loading of configuration and weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What components of a model can CheckpointLoader (dirty) load?",
        "answer": "CheckpointLoader (dirty) can load various components of a model including configurations and weights to facilitate the restoration or continuation of model training and inference processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'config_name' parameter specify in CheckpointLoader (dirty)?",
        "answer": "The 'config_name' parameter in CheckpointLoader (dirty) specifies the name of the configuration file for the model, playing a crucial role in determining the architecture and parameters for loading."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'ckpt_name' parameter indicate in CheckpointLoader (dirty)?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter in CheckpointLoader (dirty) indicates the name of the checkpoint file containing the model's weights, essential for identifying and loading the correct model state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CheckpointLoader (dirty)?",
        "answer": "The output types of CheckpointLoader (dirty) include 'model' (MODEL), 'clip' (CLIP), and 'vae' (VAE), representing the loaded model with its architecture and weights, the CLIP component, and the VAE component, respectively."
