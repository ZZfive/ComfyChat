        "question": "What is XY Input in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "XY Input is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows users to dynamically change parameters and create chart data using input elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input elements provided by the XY Input node?",
        "answer": "The XY Input node provides input elements for X value, Y value, seed, variant count, and variant type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the XY Input node be used to create dynamic chart data?",
        "answer": "The XY Input node can be used to create dynamic chart data by allowing users to input X and Y values that will be used to create a scatter plot."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the XY Input node generate multiple variants of image outputs?",
        "answer": "Yes, the XY Input node can generate multiple variants of image outputs based on the variant count and type selected by the user."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of variants can the XY Input node generate?",
        "answer": "The XY Input node can generate two types of variants: common and uniform. The common variant type generates variants based on a normal distribution, while the uniform variant type generates variants randomly within a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the XY Input node use the seed value?",
        "answer": "The XY Input node uses the seed value to initialize its random number generator, ensuring that the results are reproducible."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the XY Input node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the XY Input node in ComfyUI is to provide a dynamic and interactive way to change parameters and generate chart data, making it easier to explore the effects of different inputs on the generated images."
