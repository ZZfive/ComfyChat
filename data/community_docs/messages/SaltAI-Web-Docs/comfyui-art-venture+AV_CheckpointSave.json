        "question": "What category does AV_CheckpointSave belong to?",
        "answer": "AV_CheckpointSave belongs to the 'Art Venture/Model Merging' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does AV_CheckpointSave save?",
        "answer": "AV_CheckpointSave saves the model, CLIP model, and VAE model as part of its functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for AV_CheckpointSave?",
        "answer": "The required input types for AV_CheckpointSave include 'model', 'clip', 'vae', and 'filename_prefix'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'dtype' input in AV_CheckpointSave?",
        "answer": "The 'dtype' input in AV_CheckpointSave specifies the data type for saving the model state, providing options between 'float16' and 'float32'."
