        "question": "What does TEEDPreprocessor do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "TEEDPreprocessor in ComfyUI is designed for preprocessing images, specifically to extract soft-edge lines using the TEED (TEDDetector) model, enhancing the input image for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input required by the TEEDPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor node requires an `image` as the primary input, which is the input image to be processed for soft-edge line extraction, with Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the robustness and sensitivity of the TEEDPreprocessor line extraction process be adjusted?",
        "answer": "The robustness and sensitivity of the line extraction process in TEEDPreprocessor can be adjusted by defining the number of `safe_steps`, which affects how the extraction is handled, with Comfy dtype `INT` and Python dtype `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameter can influence the detail level in the TEEDPreprocessor output?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` parameter in TEEDPreprocessor can influence the detail level of the extracted lines, with higher values leading to more detailed results, using Comfy dtype `INT` and Python dtype `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TEEDPreprocessor output?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor outputs an enhanced image that has undergone line extraction to highlight soft edges, which is more suitable for tasks requiring detailed line information, with Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing is TEEDPreprocessor best suited for?",
        "answer": "TEEDPreprocessor is best suited for preprocessing images by extracting soft-edge lines, making it particularly useful for tasks that require detailed line information, such as further image processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type is the TEEDPreprocessor intended to run?",
        "answer": "The TEEDPreprocessor is intended to run on a `GPU` infra type, optimizing its performance for image processing tasks."
