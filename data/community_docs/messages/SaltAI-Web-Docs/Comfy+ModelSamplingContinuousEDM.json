        "question": "What is ModelSamplingContinuousEDM?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingContinuousEDM is a node in ComfyUI that applies continuous, evenly distributed model sampling techniques within a deep learning model's architecture."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ModelSamplingContinuousEDM focus on?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingContinuousEDM focuses on configuring and adjusting sampling parameters for precise control over the diffusion process in generating or processing data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ModelSamplingContinuousEDM?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ModelSamplingContinuousEDM include 'model', 'sampling', 'sigma_max', and 'sigma_min', each with specific Comfy and Python data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ModelSamplingContinuousEDM handle the 'sigma_max' input?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingContinuousEDM defines 'sigma_max' as the maximum value of sigma for the sampling process, setting an upper limit on the diffusion scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ModelSamplingContinuousEDM return?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingContinuousEDM returns a modified model with updated sampling parameters, reflecting the applied continuous, evenly distributed model sampling techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of ModelSamplingContinuousEDM?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingContinuousEDM belongs to the 'advanced/model' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for using ModelSamplingContinuousEDM?",
