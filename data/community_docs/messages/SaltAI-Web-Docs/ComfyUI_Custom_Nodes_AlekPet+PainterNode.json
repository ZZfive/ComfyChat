        "question": "What is the PainterNode in AlekPet Nodes/image category in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "PainterNode is a node in the AlekPet Nodes/image category in ComfyUI designed to process images by applying transformations and generating a corresponding mask if applicable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image' parameter in PainterNode used for?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in PainterNode specifies the image file to be processed, influencing the node's output directly by determining which input image will undergo transformations and potentially mask generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the PainterNode provide?",
        "answer": "The PainterNode provides two types of outputs: 'image', which is the transformed and properly formatted version of the input image, ready for further processing or visualization, and 'mask', which provides a mask associated with the input image, useful for distinguishing the foreground from the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of dtype does Comfy use for the output 'image'?",
        "answer": "Comfy uses the 'IMAGE' dtype for the output 'image', which is represented in Python by a 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dtype does Comfy use to represent the 'mask' output of the PainterNode?",
        "answer": "Comfy uses the 'MASK' dtype to represent the 'mask' output of the PainterNode, which is also a 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type recommended for the PainterNode?",
        "answer": "The PainterNode is recommended to be used with an infra type of 'GPU' for optimal performance in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the source code for PainterNode be automatically detected?",
        "answer": "No, the PainterNode's source code is not automatically detectable as it is considered a built-in or C extension class."
