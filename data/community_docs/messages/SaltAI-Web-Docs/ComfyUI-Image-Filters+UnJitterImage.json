        "question": "What is the purpose of the UnJitterImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnJitterImage node in ComfyUI is designed to reverse or mitigate the effects of jittering on images, utilizing a predefined matrix to adjust the positioning of pixels for a more stable visual representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in the UnJitterImage node adjusts the intensity of the un-jittering effect?",
        "answer": "The 'jitter_scale' input parameter in the UnJitterImage node adjusts the intensity of the un-jittering effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the UnJitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the UnJitterImage node is 'image', which is a torch.Tensor representing the image after the un-jittering process has been applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'oflow_align' parameter in the UnJitterImage node control?",
        "answer": "The 'oflow_align' parameter in the UnJitterImage node is a boolean flag that controls whether optical flow alignment should be used as part of the un-jittering process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'images' input parameter in the UnJitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'images' input parameter in the UnJitterImage node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the UnJitterImage node functionality?",
        "answer": "The UnJitterImage node functionality is implemented by the class 'UnJitterImage'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the UnJitterImage node?",
        "answer": "The category of the UnJitterImage node is 'image/filters/jitter'."
