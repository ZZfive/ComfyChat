        "question": "What is CM_Vec2BinaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryCondition is a class in ComfyUI that performs a binary condition operation between two 2-dimensional vectors, resulting in a boolean output based on the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2BinaryCondition belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryCondition belongs to the category 'math/vec2' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec2BinaryCondition's op method do?",
        "answer": "The op method in CM_Vec2BinaryCondition performs the specified binary condition operation between two Vec2 inputs, returning a boolean result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CM_Vec2BinaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryCondition requires inputs 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' specifies the binary condition operation, while 'a' and 'b' are 2-dimensional vectors of type Vec2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CM_Vec2BinaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryCondition outputs a boolean type ('bool') after performing the binary condition operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the usage tip for CM_Vec2BinaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The CM_Vec2BinaryCondition node operates on CPU infrastructure and belongs to the 'math/vec2' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec2BinaryCondition determine the result of the binary condition operation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryCondition determines the result of the binary condition operation using the specified 'op' between the two input 2-dimensional vectors 'a' and 'b'."
