        "question": "What is the class name of the node that separates a mask into multiple contiguous components?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node is `Separate Mask Components`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Separate Mask Components node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Separate Mask Components node belongs to the `Masquerade Nodes` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the mask input in the Separate Mask Components node?",
        "answer": "The mask input represents the complex mask that needs to be broken down into simpler, contiguous components, and is crucial for the operation of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for the Separate Mask Components node?",
        "answer": "The output types for the Separate Mask Components node are `mask`, which is of type `IMAGE`, and `mask_mappings`, which is of type `MASK_MAPPING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the mask_mappings output in the Separate Mask Components node?",
        "answer": "The mask_mappings output provides a reference to the original mask from which each separated component was derived, facilitating further processing or analysis."

    {
        "question": "Which nodes are used to separate complex masks into simpler components in the Masquerade Nodes category?",
        "answer": "The `Separate Mask Components` node is used to process a given mask by separating it into multiple contiguous components, breaking down a complex mask into simpler, individual parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Separate Mask Components node?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the Separate Mask Components node is `GPU`."
