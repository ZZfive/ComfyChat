        "question": "What does the Latent Lerp (mtb) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Lerp (mtb) node in ComfyUI performs linear interpolation between two latent vectors, blending them based on a specified ratio to create a new latent vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Latent Lerp (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Latent Lerp (mtb) node is a latent vector, represented in Comfy dtype as `LATENT` and in Python dtype as `Tuple[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]`, which is the result of blending two latent vectors."

        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can perform linear interpolation between two latent vectors?",
        "answer": "The Latent Lerp (mtb) node in ComfyUI can perform linear interpolation between two latent vectors."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Latent Lerp (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Latent Lerp (mtb) node include two latent vectors `A` and `B`, both of Comfy dtype `LATENT` and Python dtype `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, and a floating point value `t` representing the interpolation ratio, which is of Comfy dtype `FLOAT` and Python dtype `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the latent vector input in the Latent Lerp (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the latent vector input in the Latent Lerp (mtb) node is `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the interpolation ratio `t` control in the Latent Lerp (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The interpolation ratio `t` in the Latent Lerp (mtb) node determines the blend between the two input latent vectors `A` and `B`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Latent Lerp (mtb) node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the Latent Lerp (mtb) node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
