        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_SplitLatents node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitLatents node is designed to divide a batch of latents into two groups based on a specified index, which is essential for managing and manipulating latent batches within video processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latents' parameter represent in the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'latents' parameter represents the batch of latent vectors to be split, which is crucial for determining the composition of the resulting groups post-split, affecting the node's execution and outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'split_index' parameter play in the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "The 'split_index' parameter specifies the position at which the batch of latents should be divided, playing a pivotal role in determining the size and content of the two resulting latent groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'LATENT_A' represent in the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "'LATENT_A' represents the first group of latent vectors obtained after the split, based on the provided split index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is indicated by the output 'A_count' in the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "'A_count' indicates the count of latent vectors in the first group post-split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'LATENT_B' denote in the outputs of the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "'LATENT_B' denotes the second group of latent vectors obtained after the split, following the provided split index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is specified by the output 'B_count' in the VHS_SplitLatents node?",
        "answer": "'B_count' specifies the count of latent vectors in the second group post-split."
