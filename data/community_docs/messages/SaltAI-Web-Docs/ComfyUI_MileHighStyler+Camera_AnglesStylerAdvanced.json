        "question": "What is the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node in ComfyUI is designed to manipulate and enhance images by adjusting their camera angles, leveraging 3D geometry and perspective transformations to achieve a more dynamic or aesthetically pleasing composition."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node belongs to the `ali1234/stylers` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is used to control the simulation of camera angles in the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The input `camera_angles` is used to control the simulation of camera angles, including elevation and azimuth, to adjust the perspective in the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node target specific negative prompts for transformation?",
        "answer": "Yes, the `negative_prompt_to` input allows the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node to target specific negative prompts for transformation, aiming to convert them into a more positive or neutral context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `log_prompt` input in the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `log_prompt` input in the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node is used to log the prompts used for generating text, aiding in the tracking and refinement of the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node generate to reflect the overall positive outcome of the transformation?",
        "answer": "The Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node generates globally positive text, reflected in the `text_positive_g` output, which represents the overall positive outcome of the transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node output that remains negatively influenced?",
        "answer": "The Camera_AnglesStylerAdvanced node outputs text that remains negatively influenced in the `text_negative` output, serving as a baseline or control for comparison."
