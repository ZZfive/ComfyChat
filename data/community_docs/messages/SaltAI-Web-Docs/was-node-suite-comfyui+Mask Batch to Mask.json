        "question": "What is the function of the Mask Batch to Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Batch to Mask node in ComfyUI is designed to extract a single mask from a batch of masks based on a specified batch number, facilitating the selection and isolation of a specific mask from a collection for focused operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Mask Batch to Mask node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Mask Batch to Mask node is `Mask Batch to Mask`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Mask Batch to Mask node in the node list?",
        "answer": "The Mask Batch to Mask node falls under the category `WAS Suite/Image/Masking` in the node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `masks` input play in the Mask Batch to Mask node?",
        "answer": "The `masks` input in the Mask Batch to Mask node represents the collection of masks from which a single mask is to be extracted, playing a crucial role in determining the specific mask to isolate based on the batch number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the `batch_number` input?",
        "answer": "The data type for the `batch_number` input is an integer (`INT`), specifying the index of the mask to be extracted from the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the `mask` output have?",
        "answer": "The `mask` output has the Python data type `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the specified batch number is not within the range of the masks collection in the Mask Batch to Mask node?",
        "answer": "When the specified batch number is not within the range of the masks collection in the Mask Batch to Mask node, the node will print an error message indicating that the batch number is not defined and will return the last image in the collection."
