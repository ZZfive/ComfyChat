        "question": "What is the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImpactGaussianBlurMask node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a Gaussian blur to a given mask, normalizing it to a 3-dimensional format if necessary, to enhance mask smoothness and create softened edges or gradients."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node in the ImpactPack?",
        "answer": "The ImpactGaussianBlurMask node belongs to the 'Util' category in the ImpactPack."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the target area for the Gaussian blur operation in the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input defines the target area for the Gaussian blur operation in the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Gaussian blur operation in the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node adjust the blur effect?",
        "answer": "The blur effect in the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node is adjusted through the 'kernel_size' and 'sigma' parameters, where larger values for 'kernel_size' increase the blur effect and higher values for 'sigma' result in more pronounced blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to the input mask in terms of dimensionality during the process of Gaussian blurring by the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node?",
        "answer": "The input mask is normalized to a 3-dimensional format by the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node, making it suitable for the Gaussian blur operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes might a user see in conjunction with the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node for visual effects adjustment?",
        "answer": "While the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node is a part of the 'Util' category and works specifically for applying Gaussian blur to masks, users might see other nodes related to visual effects adjustment in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is essential for the efficient operation of the ImpactGaussianBlurMask node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactGaussianBlurMask node requires an 'Infra type' of 'GPU' for its efficient operation, which leverages the parallel processing power of a graphics processing unit."
