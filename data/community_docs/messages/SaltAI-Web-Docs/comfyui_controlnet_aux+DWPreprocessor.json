        "question": "What is the DWPreprocessor node used for?",
        "answer": "The DWPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for preprocessing input data specifically for the DWPose estimation tasks, transforming input data into a format suitable for pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the DWPreprocessor node output?",
        "answer": "The DWPreprocessor node outputs two types of data: 'image', which is the processed image after pose estimation, and 'pose_keypoint', which is the detected pose keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DWPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the DWPreprocessor node is 'image', the input image to be processed for pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input can control facial detail in the pose estimation?",
        "answer": "The 'detect_face' input controls the inclusion of face detection in the pose estimation, influencing the detail level of facial keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution input affect the output of DWPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized, affecting the detail level of the pose estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the pose estimation model to be used in DWPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'pose_estimator' input determines the pose estimation model, directly affecting the accuracy and performance of pose keypoint detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that the DWPreprocessor node uses to handle the estimate pose process?",
        "answer": "The DWPreprocessor node uses the function 'estimate_pose' to handle the pose estimation process."
