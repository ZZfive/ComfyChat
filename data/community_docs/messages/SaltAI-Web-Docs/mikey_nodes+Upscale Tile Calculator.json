        "question": "What is the Upscale Tile Calculator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Tile Calculator is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to calculate the dimensions of a tile based on the resolution specified, facilitating the manipulation and analysis of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types does the Upscale Tile Calculator node require?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Tile Calculator node requires an 'image' input, represented as a `torch.Tensor`, and a 'tile_resolution' input, an integer that specifies the desired resolution for the tile."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Upscale Tile Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Tile Calculator node outputs an 'image' which is the same as the input image, 'tile_width' as an integer which is the calculated width of the tile, and 'tile_height' as an integer which is the calculated height of the tile."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the tile width calculated by the Upscale Tile Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The tile width is calculated by the Upscale Tile Calculator node based on the input image's dimensions and the specified tile resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the tile_resolution parameter in the Upscale Tile Calculator node?",
        "answer": "The tile_resolution parameter in the Upscale Tile Calculator node specifies the desired resolution for the tile, directly influencing the calculation of the tile's width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust image tiles to a desired resolution?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Tile Calculator node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust image tiles to a desired resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Upscale Tile Calculator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Upscale Tile Calculator node is categorized under 'Mikey/Image' in ComfyUI."
