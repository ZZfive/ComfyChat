        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node in ComfyUI is designed to apply style alignment to a batch of models, adjusting their normalization and attention mechanisms based on shared parameters to enhance consistency and harmony of styles across different models."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node belongs to the 'EasyUse/Adapter' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model' input in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node represents the neural network model to which style alignment will be applied. It defines the base structure that will undergo normalization and attention adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'share_norm' parameter influence in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'share_norm' parameter in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node influences how normalization layers within the model should be shared or aligned, impacting the overall style consistency and coherence of the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter adjusts the intensity of style application in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node affects the intensity of style application, allowing for fine-tuning of the style's impact on the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the output model from the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the output model from the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node is `ModelPatcher`, which is a modified version of the input model, now with adjusted normalization and attention mechanisms for enhanced style alignment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name of the style alignment in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node's source code?",
        "answer": "The function name of the style alignment in the easy styleAlignedBatchAlign node's source code is 'align'."
