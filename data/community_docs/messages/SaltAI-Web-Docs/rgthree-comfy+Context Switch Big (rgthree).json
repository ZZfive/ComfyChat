        "question": "What is the function of the Context Switch Big node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node in ComfyUI is designed to manage multiple context inputs and select the first non-empty context to output, ensuring a valid context is always passed forward in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs of the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs of the Context Switch Big node include `ctx_i`, where `ctx_i` is of unknown Python dtype and has a Comfy dtype of `RGTHREE_CONTEXT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the output types provided by the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node provides output types such as `CONTEXT`, `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, `LATENT`, `IMAGE`, `SEED`, `STEPS`, `CFG`, `CKPT_NAME`, `SAMPLER`, `SCHEDULER`, `CLIP_WIDTH`, `CLIP_HEIGHT`, `TEXT_POS_G`, `TEXT_NEG_G`, `MASK`, and `CONTROL_NET`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Switch Big node determine which context input to use?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch Big node determines which context input to use by checking for the first non-empty context from the given inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the Context Switch Big node includes all types that are typically returned by context-related nodes such as models, images, masks, and conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `ui` output of the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The `ui` output of the Context Switch Big node represents a selected non-empty context from the given input contexts. This output is essential for passing a valid context to subsequent nodes in a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Context Switch Big node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the Context Switch Big node is `CPU`."
