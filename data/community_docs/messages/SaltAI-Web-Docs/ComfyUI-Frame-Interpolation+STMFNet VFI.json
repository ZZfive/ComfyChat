        "question": "What class specializes in enhancing video sequences through frame interpolation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The STMFNet VFI class specializes in enhancing video sequences through frame interpolation in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `ckpt_name` input in the STMFNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` input in the STMFNet VFI node specifies the checkpoint name for the model, determining the specific pre-trained weights to be used for frame interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in the STMFNet VFI node represents the sequence of video frames to be interpolated?",
        "answer": "The `frames` input type in the STMFNet VFI node represents the sequence of video frames to be interpolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `clear_cache_after_n_frames` input in the STMFNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `clear_cache_after_n_frames` input in the STMFNet VFI node controls the frequency of cache clearing to manage memory usage during the interpolation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the STMFNet VFI node allows for the specification of custom interpolation states?",
        "answer": "The `optional_interpolation_states` input in the STMFNet VFI node allows for the specification of custom interpolation states, offering flexibility in handling frame skipping and other advanced interpolation scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the STMFNet VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the STMFNet VFI node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, which consists of the interpolated video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting `duplicate_first_last_frames` to True in the STMFNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "Setting `duplicate_first_last_frames` to True in the STMFNet VFI node affects the output video's length and smoothness by duplicating the first and last frames."
