        "question": "What is the purpose of the Range(Step) - Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Int node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a sequence of integers within a specified range, supporting customization of start, stop, and step values, as well as inclusive and exclusive end modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Range(Step) - Int node include `start`, `stop`, `step`, and `end_mode`. These inputs set the starting value, stopping value, step interval, and whether the end is inclusive or exclusive, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `start` parameter used in the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The `start` parameter in the Range(Step) - Int node specifies the starting value of the range, setting the initial point from which the integer sequence begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the Range(Step) - Int node fall?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Int node falls under the `List Stuff` category in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What does the `range_sizes` output represent in the Range(Step) - Int node?",
        "answer": "The `range_sizes` output of the Range(Step) - Int node provides the size of each generated integer sequence, indicating the number of elements within each range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Range(Step) - Int node to operate?",
        "answer": "The Range(Step) - Int node requires a CPU infrastructure type to operate."
