        "question": "What is ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel is a specific node in ComfyUI designed to apply the AnimateLCM-I2V model for animating images using latent code motion inference with I2V capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel belong to?",
        "answer": "ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel belongs to the category 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/AnimateLCM-I2V' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "The output node of ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel is set to False."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel include motion_model, ref_latent, ref_drift, apply_ref_when_disabled, start_percent, and end_percent."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does motion_model affect the execution of ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "motion_model parameter defines the motion characteristics and dynamics applied to the static image, influencing the type of animation and movement effects in ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ref_latent represent in ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ref_latent parameter holds the reference latent representation of the image being animated, preserving the image's original characteristics during motion effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of ref_drift in ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ref_drift specifies the degree of deviation from the original image's characteristics when applying motion, allowing for adjustments in the animated output's appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does apply_ref_when_disabled determine in ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "apply_ref_when_disabled determines whether reference characteristics like drift should still be applied even if the motion model is disabled, ensuring continuity in animation."
