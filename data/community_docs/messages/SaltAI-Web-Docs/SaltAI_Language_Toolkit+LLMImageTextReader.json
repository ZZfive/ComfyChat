        "question": "What is the LLMImageTextReader node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The LLMImageTextReader node is designed to read and process images, extracting text and additional information based on user-defined parameters. It leverages image processing and text extraction technologies for image content analysis and interpretation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary role of the 'path' input in the LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The 'path' input in the LLMImageTextReader specifies the file path of the image to be processed. It is a crucial parameter as it determines the source image for text extraction and further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'extra_info' input influence the processing of images in LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The 'extra_info' input in the LLMImageTextReader is a string containing extra information in JSON format. This input can be used to provide additional context or detailed instructions for processing the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the LLMImageTextReader and what does it contain?",
        "answer": "The output of the LLMImageTextReader is structured as a document containing the results of image processing and text extraction, formatted for further analysis or display."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the input types accepted by the LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The LLMImageTextReader accepts a required 'path' input to specify the image to process and optional 'parse_text' and 'extra_info' inputs for handling text extraction and additional processing instructions respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls text extraction capabilities in the LLMImageTextReader?",
        "answer": "The 'parse_text' parameter controls whether text should be extracted from the image. If set to True, the LLMImageTextReader will perform text parsing operations on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LLMImageTextReader handle an image path that does not exist?",
        "answer": "If the 'path' input to the LLMImageTextReader specifies a file path that does not exist, the node will raise a FileNotFoundError with a message stating that no file is available at the specified path."
