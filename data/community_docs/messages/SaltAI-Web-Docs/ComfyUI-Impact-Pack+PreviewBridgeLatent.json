        "answer": "The PreviewBridgeLatent node falls under the category `ImpactPack/Util` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for the PreviewBridgeLatent node to decode latent representations?",
        "answer": "The crucial input for the PreviewBridgeLatent node to decode latent representations is the `latent` input, which contains the encoded information of the image in a compressed form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the decoding strategy for the PreviewBridgeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The decoding strategy for the PreviewBridgeLatent node is determined by the `preview_method` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the `latent` input in the PreviewBridgeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the `latent` input in the PreviewBridgeLatent node is `LATENT` in ComfyUI and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameter allows customization of the decoding process in the PreviewBridgeLatent node?",
        "answer": "The `vae_opt` parameter is optional and allows for the customization of the decoding process with specific VAE models and settings, significantly influencing the decoding outcome."
