        "question": "What is the ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS node?",
        "answer": "ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS is a custom node in ComfyUI that applies a dilation operation to masks within a collection of segmentation elements (SEGS), altering their boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS node belong?",
        "answer": "ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS belongs to the ImpactPack/Util category in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What does the `segs` input represent in ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS?",
        "answer": "The `segs` input in ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS represents the collection of segmentation elements to which the dilation operation will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the dilation operation controlled in ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS?",
        "answer": "The `dilation` input controls the dilation operation in ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS, where positive values cause masks to expand and negative values lead to contraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS produce?",
        "answer": "ImpactDilateMaskInSEGS produces a modified collection of segmentation elements (SEGS) where each mask has been dilated according to the specified dilation parameter."
