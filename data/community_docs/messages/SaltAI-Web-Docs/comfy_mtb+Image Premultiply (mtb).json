        "question": "What is the Image Premultiply (mtb) node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Premultiply (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to premultiply an image with a mask, optionally inverting the mask, to combine an image with a transparency mask affecting the image's transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly associated with the Image Premultiply (mtb) in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes associated with the Image Premultiply (mtb) in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Image Premultiply (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the Image Premultiply (mtb) node in ComfyUI is `mtb/image`."

    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'image' input parameter in the Image Premultiply (mtb) node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter represents the image to be premultiplied with the mask, serving as the primary visual content to be processed in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'mask' input parameter in the Image Premultiply (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'mask' input parameter in the Image Premultiply (mtb) node is `MASK`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'invert' parameter affect the operation of the Image Premultiply (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in the Image Premultiply (mtb) node allows for the inversion of the mask's values before applying it to the image, which can alter the visual outcome by changing which parts of the image are transparent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and dtype of the Image Premultiply (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Premultiply (mtb) node is `RGBA`, and its dtype is `IMAGE` in ComfyUI."
