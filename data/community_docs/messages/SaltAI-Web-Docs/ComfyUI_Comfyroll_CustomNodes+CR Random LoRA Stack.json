        "question": "What is the CR Random LoRA Stack node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Random LoRA Stack node is designed to manage and manipulate stacks of LoRA instances, focusing on randomizing and applying LoRA modifications to models in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Random LoRA Stack node support dynamic weight adjustments?",
        "answer": "The CR Random LoRA Stack node supports dynamic weight adjustments through features like exclusive modes, stride-based re-randomization, and the integration of multiple LoRA instances."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'exclusive_mode' parameter do in the CR Random LoRA Stack node?",
        "answer": "The 'exclusive_mode' parameter in the CR Random LoRA Stack node determines whether only one LoRA instance should be applied at a time, enabling a selection mode based on chance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'stride' parameter utilized in the CR Random LoRA Stack node?",
        "answer": "The 'stride' parameter in the CR Random LoRA Stack node sets the minimum number of cycles before a re-randomization of the LoRA weights is performed, controlling the frequency of weight adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'force_randomize_after_stride' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'force_randomize_after_stride' parameter in the CR Random LoRA Stack node ensures that a re-randomization of the LoRA weights occurs after a specified number of cycles, guaranteeing dynamic adjustments over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes can be used to manage LoRA instances in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Random LoRA Stack node can be used to manage LoRA instances in ComfyUI, enabling dynamic weight adjustments and randomization of LoRA modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Random LoRA Stack node handle multiple LoRA instances?",
        "answer": "The CR Random LoRA Stack node handles multiple LoRA instances by allowing them to be applied together in a stack, with options to adjust their activity, chance of application, model weight, and clipping weight."
