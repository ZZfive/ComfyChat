    {
        "question": "Which MotionGPT model will be loaded by default by the mgpt_model_loader node?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_model_loader node will load the `MotionGPT-base` model by default."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the mgpt_model_loader node output for use in further processes?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_model_loader node outputs a `MGPTMODEL` type data, which is the loaded and initialized MotionGPT model, ready for generating or processing motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `loadmodel` method of the mgpt_model_loader node responsible for?",
        "answer": "The `loadmodel` method is responsible for loading the MotionGPT model based on the provided `model` parameter, initializing it with the corresponding configuration and weights, and returning the initialized model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the mgpt_model_loader node handle the situation when the requested `model` doesn't exist locally?",
        "answer": "When the requested `model` doesn't exist locally, the mgpt_model_loader node will download it from the Hugging Face repository specified by `Kijai/AnimationGPT_pruned`, ensure its storage in the local `checkpoints` directory, and load it for use."
