        "question": "What is the ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI is designed to analyze and adjust the luminance of images based on gamma correction, utilizing the Recolorizer from the controlnet_aux library to modify the image's luminance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImageLuminanceDetector node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'gamma_correction' in the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'gamma_correction' specifies the gamma correction factor applied to adjust the image's luminance. A higher value brightens the image, while a lower value darkens it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resolution' input adjust in the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in the ImageLuminanceDetector node adjusts the resolution to which the image is resized before applying the luminance adjustment, affecting the detail level of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is output by the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector node outputs a modified image with adjusted luminance levels, enhancing or altering the visual appearance based on the applied gamma correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input in the ImageLuminanceDetector node is 'numpy.ndarray'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which function is executed by the ImageLuminanceDetector class?",
        "answer": "The ImageLuminanceDetector class executes the 'execute' function."
