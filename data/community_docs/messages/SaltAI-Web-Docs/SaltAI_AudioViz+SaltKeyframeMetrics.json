        "question": "What is the SaltKeyframeMetrics node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltKeyframeMetrics node is designed to compute and present various metrics for keyframe values within a given schedule, analyzing statistical properties and aiding in evaluating the dynamic range and characteristics of keyframe data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which statistical properties does SaltKeyframeMetrics analyze for keyframe sequences?",
        "answer": "SaltKeyframeMetrics analyzes maximum, minimum, sum, average, absolute sum, and absolute average values, along with the duration of the keyframe sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the SaltKeyframeMetrics node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltKeyframeMetrics node is the 'schedule_list', which represents the sequence of keyframe values to be analyzed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the SaltKeyframeMetrics node and how do they affect metric calculation?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for SaltKeyframeMetrics include 'start_frame', 'end_frame', and 'frame_rate', which influence the subset of keyframes for analysis, the range of keyframes included in calculations, and the duration of the sequence, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the SaltKeyframeMetrics node produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltKeyframeMetrics node produces outputs including 'value_min', 'value_max', 'value_sum', 'value_avg', 'abs_sum', 'abs_avg', and 'duration', which represent the minimum value, maximum value, sum of values, average of values, absolute sum, absolute average, and duration of the keyframe sequence, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the computational type and common usage pattern of the SaltKeyframeMetrics node?",
        "answer": "The SaltKeyframeMetrics node is of infra type 'CPU', and its common nodes for use are not specified in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'duration' output calculated in the SaltKeyframeMetrics node?",
        "answer": "The 'duration' output is calculated based on the 'frame_rate' and the number of frames, specifically by dividing the number of frames in the sequence by the 'frame_rate'."
