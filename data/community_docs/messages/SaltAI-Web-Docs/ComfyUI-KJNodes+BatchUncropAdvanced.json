        "question": "What is the class name of the node used for advanced uncropping of images in batches in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node used for advanced uncropping of images in batches in ComfyUI is `BatchUncropAdvanced`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BatchUncropAdvanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BatchUncropAdvanced node in ComfyUI include `original_images`, `cropped_images`, `cropped_masks`, `combined_crop_mask`, `bboxes`, `border_blending`, `crop_rescale`, `use_combined_mask`, and `use_square_mask`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BatchUncropAdvanced node specifically aim to accomplish in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchUncropAdvanced node is designed for the advanced uncropping of images in a batch process in ComfyUI. It combines original images with their cropped versions and applies techniques like border blending, rescaling, and uses masks for seamless integration of cropped areas back into the original images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `combined_crop_mask` input in the BatchUncropAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `combined_crop_mask` input in the BatchUncropAdvanced node is intended for use in advanced uncropping scenarios where a unified approach to mask application is beneficial to accurately integrate cropped images back into their original positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the `border_blending` parameter in BatchUncropAdvanced?",
        "answer": "The `border_blending` parameter in BatchUncropAdvanced determines the degree to which the borders of the cropped images are blended with the original images, influencing the seamless integration of the cropped areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenario would a user set the `use_square_mask` parameter to `True` in BatchUncropAdvanced?",
        "answer": "A user would set the `use_square_mask` parameter to `True` in BatchUncropAdvanced when a square mask is preferred to simplify the uncropping process in certain scenarios, instead of using the actual crop shapes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `crop_rescale` input in BatchUncropAdvanced's uncropping process?",
        "answer": "The `crop_rescale` input in BatchUncropAdvanced indicates whether the cropped images should be rescaled to their original size before uncropping, which is crucial for maintaining the original aspect ratio and size of the image content."
