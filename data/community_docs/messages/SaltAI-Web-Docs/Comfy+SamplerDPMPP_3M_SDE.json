        "question": "What is SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE is a custom node in ComfyUI designed specifically for DPM-Solver++(3M) SDE models, used to generate samples based on specified noise levels and device preferences."
    },

        "question": "What category does SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE belong to?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE belongs to the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/samplers' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE requires inputs such as 'eta' which defines the scale of noise, 's_noise' which specifies the noise scale, and 'noise_device' which determines whether computations are performed on CPU or GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE determine the sampler name?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE determines the sampler name based on the 'noise_device' parameter. If 'noise_device' is set to 'cpu', it uses 'dpmpp_3m_sde' as the sampler name; otherwise, it uses 'dpmpp_3m_sde_gpu'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE?",
        "answer": "The output type of SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE is a 'SAMPLER' type, specifically configured for generating samples in DPM-Solver++(3M) SDE models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE?",
        "answer": "The function of SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE is to provide a sampler through the method 'get_sampler', which initializes a sampler based on provided parameters like 'eta', 's_noise', and 'noise_device'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE?",
        "answer": "Usage tips for SamplerDPMPP_3M_SDE include running it on an 'Infra type' of 'CPU', though specific details about common nodes are unknown."
