        "question": "What is StringToNumber?",
        "answer": "`StringToNumber` is a class in ComfyUI under the category `Art Venture/Utils` that converts a string representation of a number into its numerical form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by StringToNumber?",
        "answer": "The input types required by `StringToNumber` include a `string` parameter and a `rounding` parameter, where `string` represents the number in string format and `rounding` specifies how the number should be rounded (nearest, floor, or ceil)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of StringToNumber?",
        "answer": "The output types of `StringToNumber` include an `int` type, which represents the integer part of the converted number, and a `float` type, which provides a precise floating-point representation of the converted number."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does StringToNumber handle numerical conversions?",
        "answer": "`StringToNumber` handles numerical conversions by converting the input string into a float, and then depending on the specified rounding method (`nearest`, `floor`, or `ceil`), it returns an integer and/or float representation of the converted number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the StringToNumber node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `StringToNumber` node is to convert textual representations of numbers into numerical values suitable for mathematical operations or comparisons."

    {
        "question": "What does the `string_to_numbers` function do in StringToNumber?",
        "answer": "The `string_to_numbers` function in `StringToNumber` takes a string input representing a number and a rounding method (`round`, `floor`, or `ceil`), and returns the converted number as both an integer and a float based on the specified rounding."
