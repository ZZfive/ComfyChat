        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskOuterBlur node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskOuterBlur node in ComfyUI is designed for advanced image processing, specifically to apply a blur effect to the outer regions of a mask within an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the MaskOuterBlur node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskOuterBlur node belongs to the 'Bmad/CV/Misc' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'src' input in the MaskOuterBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'src' input in the MaskOuterBlur node serves as the source image to be processed, playing a crucial role as the base for applying the mask and subsequent blurring effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask' input affect the operation of the MaskOuterBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the MaskOuterBlur node specifies the regions within the image to be blurred, determining the areas where the blur effect will be applied, allowing for selective blurring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'kernel_size' input in the MaskOuterBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'kernel_size' input in the MaskOuterBlur node specifies the size of the kernel used for the blurring operation, affecting the intensity and spread of the blur effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'paste_src' input in the MaskOuterBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'paste_src' input in the MaskOuterBlur node is an optional parameter that allows for the original source image to be pasted back onto the blurred image, enabling a combination of blurred and sharp regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MaskOuterBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MaskOuterBlur node is the resulting image after applying the blurring effect to the specified regions, potentially combining blurred and sharp regions depending on the parameters."
