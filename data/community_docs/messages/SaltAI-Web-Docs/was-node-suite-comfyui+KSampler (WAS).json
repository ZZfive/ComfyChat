        "question": "What is the KSampler (WAS) node designed for in generative models?",
        "answer": "The KSampler (WAS) node is designed for advanced sampling in generative models, allowing for customization of the sampling process through various parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which generative model is used by KSampler (WAS) for sampling?",
        "answer": "KSampler (WAS) uses the `model` input, which is the generative model used for sampling and defining the behavior and output of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `seed` parameter play in KSampler (WAS)?",
        "answer": "The `seed` parameter ensures reproducibility of the sampling results in KSampler (WAS) by influencing the randomness of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `steps` parameter affect the quality of generated samples in KSampler (WAS)?",
        "answer": "The `steps` parameter in KSampler (WAS) affects the detail and quality of the generated samples by determining the number of steps to perform in the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the `cfg` parameter in KSampler (WAS) be used for?",
        "answer": "The `cfg` parameter in KSampler (WAS) adjusts the sampling process, allowing for fine-tuning of the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `sampler_name` and `scheduler` parameters in KSampler (WAS)?",
        "answer": "The `sampler_name` parameter specifies the particular sampler to use in KSampler (WAS), enabling different sampling strategies, while the `scheduler` parameter determines the scheduling algorithm for the sampling process, impacting how samples evolve over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of KSampler (WAS) and what is its role?",
        "answer": "The output of KSampler (WAS) is the `latent` type, which is the output latent representation generated by the sampling process. This latent representation can be further used or transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `latent_image` input in KSampler (WAS)?",
        "answer": "The `latent_image` input in KSampler (WAS) is an optional latent image to start the sampling from, allowing for modifications or enhancements of existing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `denoise` parameter influence the output of the KSampler (WAS) node?",
        "answer": "The `denoise` parameter in KSampler (WAS) controls the denoising level in the sampling process, affecting the clarity and sharpness of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes are recommended for use with KSampler (WAS)?",
        "answer": "Common nodes recommended for use with KSampler (WAS) include VAEDecode, LatentUpscaleBy, VAEDecodeTiled, Reroute, LatentComposite, NNLatentUpscale, LatentUpscale, another KSampler node, workflow/front, and SetNode."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can KSampler (WAS) be used with conditioning inputs?",
        "answer": "Yes, KSampler (WAS) can be used with conditioning inputs, specifically with `positive` and `negative` conditioning parameters, which guide the sampling towards desired and away from undesired attributes, respectively."
