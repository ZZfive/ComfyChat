        "question": "What is the Saw Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve [Dream] node in ComfyUI generates a linear ramp waveform that cycles over a specified period, allowing for the creation of sawtooth wave animations based on frame count and time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Saw Curve [Dream] node output?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve [Dream] node outputs a float value representing the calculated position of the saw curve at the current frame, as well as an integer representation rounded from the float calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Saw Curve [Dream] node customize its waveform?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve [Dream] node customizes its waveform through parameters such as maximum and minimum values, periodicity in seconds, and a phase shift, allowing adjustments to the peak, base, frequency, and alignment within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Saw Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Saw Curve [Dream] node requires inputs including frame_counter (for frame count and time), max_value (maximum value of the waveform), min_value (minimum value of the waveform), periodicity_seconds (duration of one cycle in seconds), and phase (phase shift within the cycle)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the frame_counter used in the Saw Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The frame_counter in the Saw Curve [Dream] node is used to determine the current frame count and time, serving as the basis for calculating the saw curve's position within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for max_value in the Saw Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for max_value in the Saw Curve [Dream] node is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the phase parameter in the Saw Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter in the Saw Curve [Dream] node allows the waveform to be advanced or delayed within its cycle, enabling temporal adjustments in the animation."
