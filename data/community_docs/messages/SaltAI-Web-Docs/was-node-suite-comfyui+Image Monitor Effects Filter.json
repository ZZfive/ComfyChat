        "question": "What is the Image Monitor Effects Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Monitor Effects Filter node in ComfyUI is a tool that applies various monitor effect filters to an image, simulating digital, signal, and TV distortions with adjustable intensity and offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of distortions can be simulated by the Image Monitor Effects Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Image Monitor Effects Filter node simulates digital, signal, and TV distortions, providing a versatile tool for creating visually unique images with customizable distortion intensity and offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Image Monitor Effects Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Image Monitor Effects Filter node requires an input image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), mode selection (Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING], Python dtype: str) for the type of distortion effect, amplitude (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int) for intensity, and offset (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int) for effect adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `mode` input of the Image Monitor Effects Filter node determine the visual style of the output?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input of the Image Monitor Effects Filter node determines the visual style of the output by specifying the type of distortion effect to apply: Digital Distortion, Signal Distortion, or TV Distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `amplitude` input in the Image Monitor Effects Filter node?",
        "answer": "The `amplitude` input in the Image Monitor Effects Filter node controls the intensity of the distortion effect, where a higher value results in more pronounced distortions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Monitor Effects Filter node output?",
        "answer": "The Image Monitor Effects Filter node outputs an image (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) after applying the selected monitor effect filters with the specified distortion intensity and offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which classes of distortion does the Image Monitor Effects Filter node allow users to choose from in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the Image Monitor Effects Filter node allows users to choose from Digital Distortion, Signal Distortion, and TV Distortion, each simulating different classes of visual distortion."
