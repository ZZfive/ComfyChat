        "question": "What is the purpose of the LayeredDiffusionDecode node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDecode node is designed to decode images through a layered diffusion process, enhancing image quality and detail by reconstructing or generating images with a series of diffusion steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LayeredDiffusionDecode node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the LayeredDiffusionDecode node are `image` (Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`) and `mask` (Comfy dtype: `MASK`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input represents the initial state of the images before applying diffusion steps in the LayeredDiffusionDecode node?",
        "answer": "The input `images` represents the initial state of the images before applying the diffusion steps. It is a tensor of images to be processed (Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `sub_batch_size` input of the LayeredDiffusionDecode node affect the decoding operation?",
        "answer": "The `sub_batch_size` input determines the size of sub-batches for processing, optimizing the efficiency of the decoding operation and resource utilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dictate(s) the characteristics and quality of the decoded images in the LayeredDiffusionDecode node?",
        "answer": "The characteristics and quality of the decoded images in the LayeredDiffusionDecode node are determined by the input samples, represented by the `samples` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of enhancements can the LayeredDiffusionDecode node provide to images?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDecode node can enhance image quality and detail by reconstructing or generating images with a series of diffusion steps, aimed at improving visual fidelity and achieving high-resolution outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sd_version` input of the LayeredDiffusionDecode node indicate?",
        "answer": "The `sd_version` input indicates the version of the diffusion model to be used, which impacts the effectiveness of the decoding process and the final image quality."
