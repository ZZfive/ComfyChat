        "question": "What is the main functionality of the SeargeLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoraLoader node is designed to load and apply LoRA modifications to models and CLIPs for dynamic adjustment of model behaviors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SeargeLoraLoader node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoraLoader node belongs to the 'Searge/_deprecated_/Files' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the model input in the SeargeLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the model input in the SeargeLoraLoader node is `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the strength of the LoRA modification for the CLIP model determined?",
        "answer": "The strength of the LoRA modification for the CLIP model is determined by the 'strength_clip' input, which is a float within the range of -10.0 to 10.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters does the SeargeLoraLoader node take to apply a LoRA modification?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLoraLoader node takes the base model, CLIP model, LoRA name, strength for the model, and strength for the CLIP as parameters to apply a LoRA modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'lora_name' input in the SeargeLoraLoader node?",
        "answer": "The 'lora_name' input in the SeargeLoraLoader node specifies the name of the LoRA modification, which identifies the specific LoRA file or setting to be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you tweak the strength of the LoRA modification applied to the model in SeargeLoraLoader?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can tweak the strength of the LoRA modification applied to the model in SeargeLoraLoader using the 'strength_model' input, which allows for fine adjustments of the LoRA's influence on the model."
