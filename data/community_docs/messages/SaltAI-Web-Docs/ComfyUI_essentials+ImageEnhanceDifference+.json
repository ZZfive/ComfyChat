        "question": "What is the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the difference between two images by applying a power transformation, highlighting disparities for further analysis or visual effect enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node include 'image1' and 'image2', both of type IMAGE, and 'exponent' of type FLOAT, which controls the intensity of the enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node adjust the second image?",
        "answer": "The ImageEnhanceDifference+ node adjusts the second image to match the dimensions of the first image if necessary, before enhancing the difference."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node is 'image', which is the enhanced difference image, highlighting disparities between the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'exponent' parameter control in the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'exponent' parameter in the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node controls the intensity of the difference enhancement, with higher values increasing the contrast between the differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which images can be compared using the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI compares two images, 'image1' and 'image2', both of type IMAGE, serving as the baseline for the enhancement and the image to compare and adjust, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the output of the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the output of the ImageEnhanceDifference+ node in ComfyUI is torch.Tensor, representing the enhanced difference image."
