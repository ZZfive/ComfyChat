        "question": "What is the purpose of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node in ComfyUI is designed for loading motion flows from EXR image files, specifically tailored for use with Blender's vector pass in the Cycles renderer, allowing for the manipulation and use of motion vectors in downstream processing or visualization tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node is `RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels in ComfyUI's GUI?",
        "answer": "The RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node can be found in the `jamesWalker55` category within ComfyUI's GUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'path' input in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The 'path' input in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node specifies the file path to the EXR image from which motion flows are to be loaded, directing the node to the source image for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which EXR image channels can be used as inputs for the x and y components of motion flow in RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels?",
        "answer": "The RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node allows you to specify the EXR image channel (R, G, B, A) for the x-component through the 'x_channel' input, and the EXR image channel (R, G, B, A) for the y-component through the 'y_channel' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you invert the motion flow along the x-axis using the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "You can invert the motion flow along the x-axis in the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node by setting the 'invert_x' input to 'true'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output can you expect from the RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node?",
        "answer": "The RAFTLoadFlowFromEXRChannels node outputs a tensor representing the motion flow extracted from the specified EXR channels, which is of the type 'RAFT_FLOW' in ComfyUI and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
