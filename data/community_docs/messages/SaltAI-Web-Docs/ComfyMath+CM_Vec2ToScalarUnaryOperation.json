        "question": "What is CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs a unary operation on a 2-dimensional vector, transforming it into a scalar value based on a specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec2' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation abstract?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation abstracts complex mathematical operations into a simple interface, allowing transformation of vector data into a single numerical outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation require?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation requires inputs 'op', specifying the unary operation, and 'a', the 2-dimensional vector to be transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_Vec2ToScalarUnaryOperation is 'float', which represents the scalar result of the unary operation."
