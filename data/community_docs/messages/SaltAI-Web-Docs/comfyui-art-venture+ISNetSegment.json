        "question": "What is ISNetSegment?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment is a class in ComfyUI designed for image segmentation using the ISNet model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ISNetSegment belong to?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment belongs to the 'Art Venture/Segmentation' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ISNetSegment?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ISNetSegment include 'images' of type IMAGE and 'threshold' of type FLOAT."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ISNetSegment determine the sensitivity of segmentation?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment determines the sensitivity of segmentation using the 'threshold' parameter, which specifies the threshold value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types does ISNetSegment support?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment supports optional input types such as 'device_mode' for computation device preference, 'enabled' for enabling or disabling segmentation, and 'isnet_model' for specifying the ISNet model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ISNetSegment?",
        "answer": "The output types of ISNetSegment include 'segmented' images and a 'mask' indicating segmented areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ISNetSegment handle the 'enabled' flag?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment uses the 'enabled' flag to control the execution flow of the segmentation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'isnet_model' input?",
        "answer": "The 'isnet_model' input in ISNetSegment allows for specifying a custom ISNet model for segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main function of ISNetSegment?",
        "answer": "The main function of ISNetSegment is to perform image segmentation using the ISNet model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ISNetSegment optimize performance?",
        "answer": "ISNetSegment optimizes performance by allowing specification of the computation device preference ('AUTO', 'Prefer GPU', 'CPU')."
