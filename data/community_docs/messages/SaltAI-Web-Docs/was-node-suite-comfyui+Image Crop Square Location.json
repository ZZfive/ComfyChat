        "question": "What is the 'Image Crop Square Location' node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Crop Square Location' node in ComfyUI is used to crop a square region from an image based on specified coordinates and size, ensuring the crop area remains within the image's boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific parameters are required by the 'Image Crop Square Location' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Crop Square Location' node requires an image (`image`), an x-coordinate (`x`), a y-coordinate (`y`), and a size (`size`) to define the square region to crop from the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does the 'Image Crop Square Location' node output?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Crop Square Location' node outputs the cropped square region of the image, resized to ensure its dimensions are multiples of 8, and the original crop data detailing the dimensions and coordinates of the crop."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Image Crop Square Location' adjust the size of the cropped square?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Crop Square Location' adjusts the size of the cropped square if the right - left and bottom - top dimensions are less than the specified size, ensuring the size requirement is met without exceeding the image boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to the cropped square region's dimensions in the output of the 'Image Crop Square Location'?",
        "answer": "In the output of the 'Image Crop Square Location', the cropped square region's dimensions are resized to ensure they are multiples of 8, facilitating compatibility with certain image processing operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which coordinates influence the positioning of the crop area within the image using the 'Image Crop Square Location' node?",
        "answer": "The x-coordinate (`x`) influences the horizontal positioning of the crop area, while the y-coordinate (`y`) affects the vertical positioning when using the 'Image Crop Square Location' node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter determine in the 'Image Crop Square Location' node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter determines the dimensions of the resulting cropped area when using the 'Image Crop Square Location' node."
