        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Bounds node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Bounds node is designed to calculate the bounding box of an image, effectively identifying the outermost edges where content exists. This functionality is crucial for tasks that require understanding of image dimensions and spatial content, such as cropping, resizing, or further image analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the node that calculates the bounding box of an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that calculates the bounding box of an image in ComfyUI is `Image Bounds`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image Bounds node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Bounds node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Bound` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the Image Bounds node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Image Bounds node is `image`, which represents the input image for which the bounding box is to be calculated. It plays a critical role in determining the spatial limits of the content within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types and their description for the Image Bounds node?",
        "answer": "The output type for the Image Bounds node is `image_bounds`. The `image_bounds` output provides the calculated bounding box of the input image, represented as a list of tuples with the format (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) for each image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of device does the Image Bounds node work best with in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Bounds node works best with an 'infra type' of 'GPU' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data types are associated with the input and output of the Image Bounds node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the input `image` is `torch.Tensor`, and the Python dtype for the output `image_bounds` is `List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]` in ComfyUI."
