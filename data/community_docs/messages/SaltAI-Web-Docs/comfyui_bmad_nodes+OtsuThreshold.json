        "question": "What is the OtsuThreshold node in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "OtsuThreshold is a custom node in ComfyUI's Bmad/CV/Thresholding category that applies Otsu's thresholding method to separate the foreground from the background in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs the image that will be thresholded by Otsu's method?",
        "answer": "The input image to be thresholded by Otsu's method is processed through the `image` input of the OtsuThreshold node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `threshold_type` parameter in the OtsuThreshold node control?",
        "answer": "The `threshold_type` parameter in the OtsuThreshold node specifies the type of thresholding to apply, influencing how the foreground and background are distinguished."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Gaussian blur preprocessing work in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "In the OtsuThreshold node, Gaussian blur preprocessing is controlled by `gaussian_blur_x` and `gaussian_blur_y`, specifying the kernel width and height. This process helps in reducing noise before thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `gaussian_border_type` in the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "`gaussian_border_type` in the OtsuThreshold node determines how the borders of the image are handled during the Gaussian blur process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the OtsuThreshold node?",
        "answer": "The output of the OtsuThreshold node is the image after applying Otsu's thresholding method, with the foreground and background successfully separated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the OtsuThreshold node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OtsuThreshold node belongs to the Bmad/CV/Thresholding category in ComfyUI."
