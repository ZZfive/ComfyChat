    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_IntUnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_IntUnaryCondition are 'op', which specifies the unary operation as a string, and 'a', an integer value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_IntUnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_IntUnaryCondition specifies the unary operation to be performed on the integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_IntUnaryCondition handle unary operations?",
        "answer": "CM_IntUnaryCondition abstracts the complexity of various unary operations into a simple interface, allowing evaluation or transformation of single integer values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_IntUnaryCondition's 'op' function return?",
        "answer": "CM_IntUnaryCondition's 'op' function returns a boolean value based on the specified unary operation."
