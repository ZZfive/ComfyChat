        "question": "What is the Range Float node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Range Float node is used to generate a list of floating-point numbers within a specified range using a step value, then selects a specific number based on a seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Range Float node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range Float node belongs to the 'Mikey/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' input of the Range Float node define?",
        "answer": "The 'start' input defines the starting point of the range, crucial for determining the lower bound of the generated sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'end' input in the Range Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'end' input specifies the ending point of the range, setting the upper limit for the sequence of numbers to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'step' input control in the Range Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input determines the increment between each number in the range, affecting the density and total count of numbers in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'seed' input utilized by the Range Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input is used as a basis for selecting a specific number from the generated list, ensuring a deterministic selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Range Float node output?",
        "answer": "The Range Float node outputs a floating-point number selected from the generated sequence, and a string representation of the selected floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type supported by the Range Float node?",
        "answer": "The Range Float node supports CPU as the infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the process used by the Range Float node to select a number based on the 'seed'?",
        "answer": "The Range Float node generates a list of numbers from 'start' to 'end' with a 'step' value, then selects the number at the 'offset', calculated as 'seed' modulo the length of the list."
