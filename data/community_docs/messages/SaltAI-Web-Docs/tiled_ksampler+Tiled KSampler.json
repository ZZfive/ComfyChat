        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tiled KSampler node in generative models using ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Tiled KSampler node in generative models using ComfyUI is to perform advanced sampling, specifically designed for handling tiled inputs and incorporating customizable sampling strategies."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input plays a crucial role in defining the architecture and parameters for the sampling process in the Tiled KSampler?",
        "answer": "The input `model` plays a crucial role in defining the architecture and parameters for the sampling process in the Tiled KSampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `latent_image` input in the Tiled KSampler node and how is it used?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `latent_image` input in the Tiled KSampler node is `LATENT`, which is a `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`. It is used as an initial latent image to start the sampling from, allowing for modifications or enhancements of existing samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the Tiled KSampler node controls the denoising strength during the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The input `denoise`, which has a data type of `FLOAT` and Python dtype of `float`, controls the denoising strength during the sampling process in the Tiled KSampler node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type (`latent`) of the Tiled KSampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Tiled KSampler node in ComfyUI is `latent`, which has a Comfy dtype of `LATENT` and Python dtype of `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`. It represents the generated latent representation that can be further processed or converted into a final image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input controls whether circular padding should be applied for enhancing the quality of tiled samples in the Tiled KSampler?",
        "answer": "The input `tiling`, which has a Comfy dtype of `INT` and Python dtype of `int`, controls whether circular padding should be applied for enhancing the quality of tiled samples in the Tiled KSampler."
