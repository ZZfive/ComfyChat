    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input does the 'image' parameter of the Unimatch Optical Flow node require?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter requires a sequence of images for which optical flow needs to be estimated, with the input type of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Unimatch Optical Flow node in ComfyUI affect bidirectional flow estimation?",
        "answer": "The Unimatch Optical Flow node can estimate bidirectional flow when the 'bidirectional_flow' flag is set to True, enhancing motion analysis by considering both forward and backward flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ckpt_name' parameter specify when using the Unimatch Optical Flow node?",
        "answer": "The 'ckpt_name' parameter specifies the name of the checkpoint file for the Unimatch model, determining the specific pre-trained model version used for flow estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Unimatch Optical Flow node provide?",
        "answer": "The Unimatch Optical Flow node provides two outputs: 'OPTICAL_FLOW', which is the enhanced optical flow predictions processed through the Unimatch algorithm, and 'PREVIEW_IMAGE', a visualization of the optical flow predictions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for the Unimatch Optical Flow node to estimate optical flow, and what input length is necessary?",
        "answer": "The Unimatch Optical Flow node requires at least two frames as a optical flow estimator, making it suitable for video input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which algorithm does the Unimatch Optical Flow node utilize to refine optical flow predictions?",
