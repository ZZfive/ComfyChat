        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node in ComfyUI is designed to extract and present detailed information about a video that has been loaded into the system, providing metrics such as frame rate, frame count, video duration, and the dimensions of the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the `video_info` input parameter contain in the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node?",
        "answer": "The `video_info` input parameter contains the metadata of the loaded video, including its frame rate, frame count, duration, width, and height, which is essential for the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node to extract detailed information about the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node output for the frame rate of the loaded video?",
        "answer": "The VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node outputs the frame rate of the loaded video in a format recognized by Comfy as `FLOAT`, which is a numerical representation in Python of type `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the total number of frames in the video represented by the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node?",
        "answer": "The total number of frames in the video is represented by the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node as `frame_countðŸŸ¦`, with a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `widthðŸŸ¦` output from the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node signify?",
        "answer": "The `widthðŸŸ¦` output from the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node signifies the width of the loaded video in pixels, represented with a Comfy dtype of `INT` and a Python dtype of `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node run on the GPU or is it limited to the CPU?",
        "answer": "The VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node is limited to running on the CPU, as indicated by its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class method in the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node source code defines the input types?",
        "answer": "The `INPUT_TYPES` class method in the VHS_VideoInfoLoaded node source code defines the input types, specifying that the `video_info` parameter is of type `VHS_VIDEOINFO`."
