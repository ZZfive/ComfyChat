        "question": "What is the class name for the node that transforms a noisy mask into a cleaner one for compositing purposes?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that transforms a noisy mask into a cleaner one for compositing purposes is `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node belong to?",
        "answer": "The `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node belongs to the `inpaint` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node is designed to transform a noisy mask into a cleaner, more usable mask for compositing purposes by adjusting the mask based on provided offset and threshold parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `mask` input in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node serves as the primary data for the denoising process, and it is of type `MASK` (torch.Tensor) in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `offset` parameter function in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The `offset` parameter in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node allows for adjusting the starting point of the mask's intensity to aid in the denoising process, and it is of type `FLOAT` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `threshold` parameter used for in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` parameter in the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node defines the upper limit of mask intensity to be considered in denoising, helping to isolate significant parts of the mask from noise, and it is of type `FLOAT` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected type of the output from the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The expected type of the output from the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node is a denoised `mask` of type `MASK` (torch.Tensor) in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for using the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the `INPAINT_DenoiseToCompositingMask` node is `GPU`."
