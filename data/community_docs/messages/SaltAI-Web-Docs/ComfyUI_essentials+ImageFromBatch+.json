    {
        "question": "What is ImageFromBatch+ used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImageFromBatch+ is used for extracting a specific range of images from a batch based on the provided start index and length, allowing selective processing or analysis of batched image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input parameter represent in ImageFromBatch+?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter in ImageFromBatch+ represents the batched image input from which a subset will be extracted. It specifies the source of the images to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python and Comfy dtypes for the 'image' input in ImageFromBatch+?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input in ImageFromBatch+ is `torch.Tensor`, and the Comfy dtype is `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start' input control in ImageFromBatch+?",
        "answer": "The 'start' input in ImageFromBatch+ specifies the starting index within the batch from which images will be extracted, determining the beginning of the subset to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the 'length' input parameter is set to a negative value in ImageFromBatch+?",
        "answer": "If the 'length' input parameter is set to a negative value in ImageFromBatch+, it will default to the total number of images in the batch, effectively extracting the rest of the images from the start index."
