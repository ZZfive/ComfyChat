        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWImageStackChannels node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageStackChannels node in ComfyUI is designed to stack two image tensors along their channel dimension, effectively combining them into a single tensor that retains the information from both input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the JWImageStackChannels node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageStackChannels node belongs to the 'jamesWalker55' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the JWImageStackChannels node include 'image_a' and 'image_b', both of which are image tensors of dtype 'IMAGE' and type 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWImageStackChannels node is a single image tensor of dtype 'IMAGE' and type 'torch.Tensor', resulting from stacking the two input image tensors along their channel dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the JWImageStackChannels node stack image tensors?",
        "answer": "The JWImageStackChannels node stacks image tensors by concatenating the 'image_a' and 'image_b' tensors along the third dimension using the torch.cat() function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the requirements for the input image tensors in the JWImageStackChannels node?",
        "answer": "The input image tensors in the JWImageStackChannels node, 'image_a' and 'image_b', must both be of dtype 'IMAGE' and type 'torch.Tensor' to be stacked by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWImageStackChannels node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWImageStackChannels node is not an output node in ComfyUI according to its documentation."
