        "question": "What is the class name of the node that provides a constant floating-point value?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that provides a constant floating-point value is `FloatConstant`."

        "question": "What is the category of the FloatConstant node?",
        "answer": "The category of the FloatConstant node is `KJNodes/constants`."

        "question": "Is FloatConstant an output node?",
        "answer": "No, FloatConstant is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type does FloatConstant require to define a constant floating-point value?",
        "answer": "FloatConstant requires the input type `value` which specifies the floating-point value to be used as a constant."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the parameter 'value' that defines the constant floating-point value described?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'value' allows for a wide range of values, enabling the node to serve various computational needs with precision, and it has a comfy dtype of `FLOAT`. Its Python dtype is `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does FloatConstant output and how is it represented?",
        "answer": "FloatConstant outputs the same floating-point value as defined by the input, serving as a constant throughout the node's usage. This output is represented with a comfy dtype of `FLOAT` and a Python dtype of `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the usage of FloatConstant?",
        "answer": "The infra type required for the usage of FloatConstant is `CPU`."
