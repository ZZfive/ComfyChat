        "question": "What is Smooth Event Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Smooth Event Curve [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI designed for generating smoothly transitioning curves based on a frame counter, facilitating animations with gradual starts and ends."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node calculate?",
        "answer": "The Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node calculates values within a specified range and time frame using a smoothing algorithm, ensuring a gradual transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The input types required for the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node include frame_counter, max_value, min_value, width_seconds, and center_seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the frame_counter input affect the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The frame_counter input determines the current time in seconds, influencing the position on the curve and the timing of its progression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the max_value input define in the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The max_value input specifies the maximum value the curve can reach, defining its amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node handle the width_seconds input?",
        "answer": "The width_seconds input determines the duration of the smooth transition, affecting the width of the curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the center_seconds input specify for the Smooth Event Curve [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The center_seconds input sets the center point of the curve in seconds, around which the smooth transition is centered."
