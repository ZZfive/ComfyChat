        "question": "What is the SaltThresholdSchedule node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltThresholdSchedule node is designed to apply a fading effect to a schedule list based on specified parameters in ComfyUI, enabling dynamic adjustment of schedule values to create smooth transitions or emphasize certain parts through fading in, fading out, or both."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does SaltThresholdSchedule belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltThresholdSchedule belongs to the 'SALT/Scheduling' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'float_schedule' input utilized in SaltThresholdSchedule?",
        "answer": "The 'float_schedule' input in the SaltThresholdSchedule node is the list of schedule values that will be modified with a fading effect, serving as the base values for the fading modification process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'max_frames' specify in the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "In the SaltThresholdSchedule node, 'max_frames' specifies the maximum number of frames for the schedule, limiting the length of the output schedule list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the function of the 'output_mode' parameter in the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_mode' parameter in SaltThresholdSchedule defines the format of the output schedule list, such as 'prompt_schedule', 'float_list', 'int_list', or 'raw', thereby determining how the modified schedule values are presented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule_values' input represent in the SaltThresholdSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_values' input in SaltThresholdSchedule is a string that details specific schedule values and their corresponding descriptions or settings, allowing for the customization of schedule values based on textual descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value_schedule_list' output from the SaltThresholdSchedule node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'value_schedule_list' output from the SaltThresholdSchedule node contains the modified schedule list after applying the specified fading effect, showcasing the dynamic transitions between values."
