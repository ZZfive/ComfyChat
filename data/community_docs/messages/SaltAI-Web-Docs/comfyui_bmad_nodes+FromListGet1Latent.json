        "question": "What is the role of the FromListGet1Latent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node in ComfyUI is designed to extract a single latent representation from a list of latents, simplifying the process of selecting a specific latent item for further operations or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'list' input of the FromListGet1Latent node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'list' input of the FromListGet1Latent node expects a list of latent representations. This parameter is crucial for specifying the source of the latent to be selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the FromListGet1Latent node determine which latent to extract?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node determines which latent to extract by using the 'index' input, which specifies the position of the latent representation in the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the latent representation extracted by the FromListGet1Latent node?",
        "answer": "The output format of the latent representation extracted by the FromListGet1Latent node is a torch.Tensor, which is of the type LATENT in ComfyUI's data type system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FromListGet1Latent node belong to in the ComfyUI node catalog?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node belongs to the 'Bmad/Lists/Get1' category in the ComfyUI node catalog."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type supported by the FromListGet1Latent node?",
        "answer": "The FromListGet1Latent node supports the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the FromListGet1Latent node be used to extract multiple latent representations simultaneously?",
        "answer": "No, the FromListGet1Latent node is designed to extract a single latent representation at a time. It is not suitable for extracting multiple latent representations simultaneously."
