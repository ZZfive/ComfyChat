        "answer": "ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the positional encoding (PE) within a model by stretching it to a new length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch allow you to do?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch allows you to dynamically modify the PE to accommodate different sequence lengths or to apply specific transformations for animation or advanced modeling purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch are `pe_stretch`, which specifies the amount by which the positional encoding should be stretched, and `print_adjustment`, a boolean flag that enables printing of the adjustment process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch?",
        "answer": "The output type of ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch is `pe_adjust`, which returns an updated adjustment group that includes the new positional encoding stretch, ready for further processing or application."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you use ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustPEFullStretch can be used to handle longer sequences in models or apply specific transformations by stretching the positional encoding dynamically."
