        "question": "What is the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageAdjust node in ComfyUI is designed to apply scheduled adjustments to a batch of images, enabling dynamic changes in brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, Gaussian blur, and edge enhancement over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node is a collection of images (`images`) to be adjusted, which is central to the node's operation as it defines the set of images that will undergo the scheduled transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `masks` input in SaltScheduledImageAdjust?",
        "answer": "The `masks` input in SaltScheduledImageAdjust is optional, allowing for the selective application of adjustments on the images. This provides more precise control over which areas of the images are affected by the adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI controls dynamic changes in image properties over time?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageAdjust node in ComfyUI controls dynamic changes in image properties over time, allowing for scheduled adjustments in brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, Gaussian blur, and edge enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the brightness of images change over time in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The brightness of images can change over time in ComfyUI through the use of the `brightness_schedule` input in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node, which defines how the brightness should evolve based on a predefined sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node in ComfyUI is the `image`, which represents the adjusted images after the application of the scheduled adjustments, showcasing the dynamic changes over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the `saturation_schedule` input expect in SaltScheduledImageAdjust?",
        "answer": "The `saturation_schedule` input in the SaltScheduledImageAdjust node expects a `List[float]` in Python, which defines how the color intensity of the images changes over time, enabling the creation of vibrant or muted color sequences."
