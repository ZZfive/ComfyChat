        "question": "What is the purpose of the AdjustRect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AdjustRect node is designed to adjust the dimensions and position of a rectangle based on specified modifiers and rounding modes. It simplifies geometric transformations and recalibrates rectangle coordinates for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `a` input do in the AdjustRect node?",
        "answer": "The `a` input in the AdjustRect node represents one of the coordinates (either x1 or y1) of the original rectangle. It plays a crucial role in determining the new adjusted rectangle's position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `input_format` input handle in AdjustRect?",
        "answer": "The `input_format` input in the AdjustRect node handles information about the format of the input coordinates. It influences how they are interpreted and transformed during the adjustment process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `xm` input in AdjustRect node specify?",
        "answer": "The `xm` input in the AdjustRect node specifies the modifier for the rectangle's width adjustment, affecting the calculation of the new width. It's a crucial parameter for adjusting the horizontal extents of the rectangle."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the AdjustRect node defines the rounding mode?",
        "answer": "The `round_mode` input in the AdjustRect node determines the rounding mode to be applied during the adjustment process. It impacts how the final dimensions of the rectangle are calculated."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what ways can the output coordinates of AdjustRect be specified?",
        "answer": "The format for the output coordinates of AdjustRect can be specified via the `output_format` input, determining how the adjusted rectangle's dimensions and position are represented after adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AdjustRect node?",
        "answer": "The AdjustRect node outputs the adjusted rectangle's coordinates as a tuple of four integers, reflecting the modifications applied based on the input parameters."
