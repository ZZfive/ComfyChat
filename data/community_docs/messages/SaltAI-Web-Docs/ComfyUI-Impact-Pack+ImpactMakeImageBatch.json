        "question": "What is the ImpactMakeImageBatch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageBatch node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple images into a single batch, potentially resizing images to ensure uniform dimensions, facilitating operations that require consistent image sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactMakeImageBatch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageBatch node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary image in ImpactMakeImageBatch used for?",
        "answer": "The primary image in ImpactMakeImageBatch serves as the reference for resizing operations if other images differ in dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ImpactMakeImageBatch node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeImageBatch node produces a single tensor representing a batch of images, where each image has been resized as necessary to match the dimensions of the first image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the dimensions of images differ in the ImpactMakeImageBatch process?",
        "answer": "If the dimensions of images differ in the ImpactMakeImageBatch process, images are resized to match the dimensions of the first image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type does the output 'image' of the ImpactMakeImageBatch node use?",
        "answer": "The output 'image' of the ImpactMakeImageBatch node uses the Python data type 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the ImpactMakeImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the ImpactMakeImageBatch node is 'GPU'."
