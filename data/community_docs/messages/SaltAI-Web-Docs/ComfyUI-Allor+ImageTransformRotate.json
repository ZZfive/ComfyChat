        "question": "What node in ComfyUI is used for rotating images?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformRotate node in ComfyUI is used for rotating a batch of images by a specified angle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The ImageTransformRotate node belongs to the 'image/transform' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'images' input in the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the ImageTransformRotate node specifies the batch of images that will undergo rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the rotation method specified in the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The rotation method in the ImageTransformRotate node is specified through the 'method' input, which supports various options such as 'lanczos', 'bicubic', 'hamming', 'bilinear', 'box', and 'nearest'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'expand' parameter do in ImageTransformRotate?",
        "answer": "The 'expand' parameter in ImageTransformRotate is a boolean flag that indicates whether the images should be expanded to fit the rotated image without clipping."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the supersampling anti-aliasing level set in ImageTransformRotate?",
        "answer": "The supersampling anti-aliasing level in ImageTransformRotate is set through the 'SSAA' input, which determines the smoothness of the edges and reduces aliasing in the rotated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageTransformRotate node is the rotated images, which are returned as a batch, reflecting the transformed images after applying the specified rotation and any additional processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the ImageTransformRotate node is IMAGE, which corresponds to a List of torch.Tensor objects in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for using the ImageTransformRotate node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type recommended for using the ImageTransformRotate node is GPU."
