        "question": "What is the purpose of the Deep Translator CLIP Text Encode Node?",
        "answer": "The Deep Translator CLIP Text Encode Node is designed to integrate translation services with CLIP text encoding, facilitating the translation of text inputs into different languages and subsequently encoding these translations into a format suitable for conditioning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode belong to in AlekPet Nodes?",
        "answer": "The DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode belongs to the category `AlekPet Nodes/conditioning`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'from_translate' input specify in the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'from_translate' input specifies the source language for translation, supporting a dynamic range of languages based on the selected translation service."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode facilitate proxy usage for its translation service?",
        "answer": "The DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode facilitates proxy usage for its translation service by enabling the 'add_proxies' input, which indicates whether proxy usage is enabled, and the 'proxies' input, which provides the specific proxy settings to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required to support authorization for the translation service in the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode?",
        "answer": "The 'auth_data' input in the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode contains authorization data required by some translation services, ensuring secure access to the translation features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode generate that can be used in conditioning models?",
        "answer": "The DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode generates an output of the encoded representation of the translated text under the name 'conditioning', formatted for use in conditioning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of text does the 'text' input of the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode accept?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input of the DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode accepts the text input to be translated and encoded, serving as the content that undergoes translation and subsequent text encoding."
