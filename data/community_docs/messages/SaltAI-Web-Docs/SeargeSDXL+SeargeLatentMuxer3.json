        "question": "What is the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SeargeLatentMuxer3 is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to select one of three provided latent inputs based on a specified selector input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeLatentMuxer3 node belongs to the 'Searge/_deprecated_/FlowControl' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node is to facilitate dynamic control over which latent input to use in a computational graph, enabling flexible manipulation of latent representations in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_selector' control in the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_selector' is an integer that determines which of the three latent inputs to use, ranging from 0 to 2, with each number corresponding to one of the latent inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output' represent in the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The 'output' represents the selected latent input, based on the value of the input selector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node include 'input0', 'input1', 'input2', and 'input_selector'. Each of these inputs is necessary for the node to function as intended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can be inferred about the 'input0', 'input1', and 'input2' inputs in the SeargeLatentMuxer3 node?",
        "answer": "'input0', 'input1', and 'input2' are latent input options for selection, each carrying a Comfy data type of 'LATENT' and a Python data type of 'tuple'."
