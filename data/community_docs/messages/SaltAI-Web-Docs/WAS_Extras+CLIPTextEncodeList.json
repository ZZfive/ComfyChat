        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncodeList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeList node in ComfyUI is designed for encoding multiple textual inputs using a CLIP model, transforming them into a structured format for further computational tasks or analyses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clip' parameter represent in the CLIPTextEncodeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeList node represents the CLIP model used for text encoding, which determines how text inputs are processed and encoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the CLIPTextEncodeList node produce?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncodeList node produces a conditioning sequence derived from the encoded text inputs, output as a sequence of conditionings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are weights interpreted during the encoding process in the CLIPTextEncodeList node?",
        "answer": "Weights are interpreted based on the 'weight_interpretation' parameter, which influences the final encoded output by tailoring the encoding to specific weight interpretation preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the CLIPTextEncodeList node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the CLIPTextEncodeList node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' parameter represent in the CLIPTextEncodeList node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the CLIPTextEncodeList node represents the textual input to be encoded, which is essential as it provides the raw data for the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the node do with the token normalization setting?",
        "answer": "The node uses the 'token_normalization' parameter to specify the method for normalizing tokens, affecting the outcome of the encoding process based on the chosen normalization strategy."
