        "question": "What is CM_FloatBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs binary operations on two float inputs, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_FloatBinaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryOperation belongs to the category 'math/float' within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_FloatBinaryOperation abstract?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryOperation abstracts the complexity of float arithmetic operations, providing a straightforward way to execute binary mathematical operations on float values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does CM_FloatBinaryOperation require?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryOperation requires inputs 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' specifies the binary operation (e.g., addition, subtraction), 'a' is the first float input, and 'b' is the second float input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_FloatBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_FloatBinaryOperation is a single float value representing the outcome of the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for CM_FloatBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryOperation is intended for use on CPUs. The common nodes it interacts with are currently unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide an example of how CM_FloatBinaryOperation works?",
        "answer": "Sure, here's an example usage: If 'op' is set to 'addition', 'a' is 5.0, and 'b' is 3.0, CM_FloatBinaryOperation would return 8.0 as the result."
