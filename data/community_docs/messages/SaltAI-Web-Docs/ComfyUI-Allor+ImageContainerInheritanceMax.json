        "question": "What is ImageContainerInheritanceMax?",
        "answer": "ImageContainerInheritanceMax is a class in ComfyUI designed to manage image data by applying a 'maximum' operation across multiple images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageContainerInheritanceMax node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageContainerInheritanceMax node manages image data by computing the maximum pixel value across corresponding pixels of multiple input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageContainerInheritanceMax?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageContainerInheritanceMax include 'images_a' and 'images_b' as collections of images, 'red', 'green', 'blue' specifying color components, and 'alpha' defining transparency. Additionally, 'method' determines how the 'maximum' operation is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageContainerInheritanceMax handle image dimensions?",
        "answer": "ImageContainerInheritanceMax abstracts the complexity of handling image dimensions by determining the maximum width and height from the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageContainerInheritanceMax node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageContainerInheritanceMax node is a single image represented as a composite result of applying the 'maximum' operation across all input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' parameter specify in ImageContainerInheritanceMax?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in ImageContainerInheritanceMax specifies how the 'maximum' operation is applied: 'single' creates a single composite image, 'for_each_pair' generates images for each pair, and 'for_each_matrix' creates images for each combination of images from 'images_a' and 'images_b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What tips are provided for using ImageContainerInheritanceMax?",
        "answer": "ImageContainerInheritanceMax is recommended for usage with GPU infrastructures. The behavior of the node with common nodes is unknown."
