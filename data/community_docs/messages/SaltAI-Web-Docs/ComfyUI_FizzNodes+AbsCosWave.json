        "question": "What is the AbsCosWave node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AbsCosWave node in ComfyUI is used to generate a wave pattern based on the absolute value of a cosine function, which can create dynamic, visually interesting waveforms for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the AbsCosWave node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AbsCosWave node belongs to the category `FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/WaveNodes` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter controls the periodicity of the AbsCosWave pattern?",
        "answer": "The phase parameter controls the periodicity of the AbsCosWave pattern, affecting how frequently the wave pattern repeats over a given interval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the height of the wave peaks in the AbsCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude output from the AbsCosWave node determines the height of the wave peaks, influencing the overall intensity of the wave pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the wave's starting position adjusted in the AbsCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The wave's starting position is adjusted in the AbsCosWave node through the `x_translation` parameter, which shifts the wave pattern along the horizontal axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What sets the upper limit for the wave's value in the AbsCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The `max_value` parameter sets the upper limit for the wave's value in the AbsCosWave node, capping the peak height and affecting the wave's amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `current_frame` parameter represent in the AbsCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The `current_frame` parameter in the AbsCosWave node represents a specific point in time or sequence, which is used to calculate the wave's position and shape at that moment."
