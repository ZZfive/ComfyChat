        "question": "Which category does the Regional Seed Explorer by Color Mask node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Regional Seed Explorer by Color Mask node belongs to the `InspirePack/Regional` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the color_mask input determine in the RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The color_mask input determines the region of interest for seed exploration by defining where the seed variations will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the specific color in the mask that identifies the target region for seed variations?",
        "answer": "The `mask_color` input defines the specific color in the mask for targeting region-specific variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `noise_mode` input in RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire determine?",
        "answer": "The `noise_mode` input specifies whether the noise processing should occur on the CPU or GPU, affecting performance and resource utilization."

    {
        "question": "What are the two outputs that RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire returns?",
        "answer": "RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire returns the `noise` and `mask`, the modified noise pattern and the original color mask used to define the target region, respectively."
