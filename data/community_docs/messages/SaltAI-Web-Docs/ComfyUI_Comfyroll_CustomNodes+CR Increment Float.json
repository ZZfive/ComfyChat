        "question": "What is the CR Increment Float node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Increment Float node is designed to incrementally adjust floating-point values, facilitating the creation of sequences or gradients of numbers. This node is particularly useful in scenarios where gradual changes or interpolations are required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'start_value' input in the CR Increment Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_value' input specifies the initial value from which the incrementation starts, setting the baseline for the sequence generation. It is of Comfy dtype 'FLOAT' and Python dtype 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_duration' input control in the CR Increment Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_duration' input specifies the duration in frames for each increment step, affecting the timing and pacing of the sequence. It is of Comfy dtype 'INT' and Python dtype 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'current_value' calculated in the CR Increment Float node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_value' in the CR Increment Float node is calculated by taking the 'start_value', and for each frame after the 'start_frame', incrementing it by the 'step' value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node should I use if I want to create a sequence of floating-point values with a gradual increment?",
        "answer": "You should use the CR Increment Float node in ComfyUI's Animation/Interpolate category to create a sequence of floating-point values with a gradual increment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the CR Increment Float node sets the starting point for the frame sequence?",
        "answer": "The 'start_frame' input sets the starting frame for the incrementation process, marking the point at which the sequence begins. It is of Comfy dtype 'INT' and Python dtype 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the 'show_help' output of the CR Increment Float node.",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output of the CR Increment Float node provides additional information or guidance related to the node's operation. It is output as a 'STRING' in ComfyUI and as a 'str' in Python."
