        "question": "What is the purpose of the TSC_EvaluateFloats node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TSC_EvaluateFloats node is designed to evaluate mathematical expressions involving floats and convert the results into multiple formats (integer, float, and string) for further use in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the TSC_EvaluateFloats node handle dynamic computations?",
        "answer": "The TSC_EvaluateFloats node can handle dynamic computations through the 'python_expression' input, which allows for floating-point operations to be defined, and optional input variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' that can be used within the expression for dynamic evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'print_to_console' input do in the TSC_EvaluateFloats node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_to_console' input in the TSC_EvaluateFloats node is a flag that, when set to 'True', enables the node to print the evaluation results to the console for debugging or informational purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the TSC_EvaluateFloats node provide?",
        "answer": "The TSC_EvaluateFloats node provides outputs in the form of integer ('int'), float ('float'), and string ('string') representations of the evaluated expression's result."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which custom node can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions and output the results in multiple formats?",
        "answer": "The TSC_EvaluateFloats node in ComfyUI can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions and output the results in integer, float, and string formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the output of the TSC_EvaluateFloats node be customized to different data types?",
        "answer": "Yes, the output of the TSC_EvaluateFloats node can be customized to different data types, including integer, float, and string formats, which can be further used in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required by the TSC_EvaluateFloats node?",
        "answer": "The TSC_EvaluateFloats node requires an infrastructure type of 'CPU' for its operations."
