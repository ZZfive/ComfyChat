        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImagePaste node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node in ComfyUI is designed to overlay a foreground image with transparency onto a background image, effectively merging them into a single composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output of the ImagePaste node?",
        "answer": "The primary output of the ImagePaste node is a composite image that results from pasting the foreground image over the background, converted back to a tensor format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImagePaste node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImagePaste node are a background image (`background_image`), foreground image (`foreground_image`), x_position, and y_position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the `background_image` and `foreground_image` inputs in the ImagePaste node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the `background_image` and `foreground_image` inputs in the ImagePaste node is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImagePaste node in ComfyUI use the alpha channel when pasting images?",
        "answer": "The ImagePaste node uses the alpha channel as a mask when pasting the foreground image onto the background image, allowing for seamless blending of the two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the x_position and y_position inputs in the ImagePaste node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The x_position and y_position inputs determine the horizontal and vertical position, respectively, where the top-left corner of the foreground image will be placed on the background image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which function is responsible for the conversion of the tensors to PIL images in the ImagePaste node?",
        "answer": "The function `tensor2pil` is responsible for converting the tensors to PIL images in the ImagePaste node."
