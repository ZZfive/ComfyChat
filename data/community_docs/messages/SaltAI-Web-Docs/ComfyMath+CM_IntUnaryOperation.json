        "question": "What category does CM_IntUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_IntUnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/int' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_IntUnaryOperation's op method do?",
        "answer": "The op method in CM_IntUnaryOperation applies a specified unary operation to a single integer input, modifying its value based on predefined operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for CM_IntUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_IntUnaryOperation requires inputs 'op', which specifies the unary operation as a string, and 'a', which is an integer to be modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CM_IntUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_IntUnaryOperation is an integer (INT), which is the result of applying the unary operation to the input integer."
