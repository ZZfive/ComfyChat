        "question": "What is SplitSigmas?",
        "answer": "SplitSigmas is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for dividing a sequence of sigma values into two parts based on a specified step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of SplitSigmas?",
        "answer": "The purpose of SplitSigmas is to enable more flexible and targeted manipulation of sigma values by dividing them into two sequences at a specified index."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SplitSigmas divide the sigma values?",
        "answer": "SplitSigmas divides the sigma values into two sequences by splitting them at a specified index using the 'step' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SplitSigmas?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SplitSigmas are 'sigmas', which represents the sequence of sigma values, and 'step', which specifies the index for splitting the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of SplitSigmas?",
        "answer": "SplitSigmas outputs two sequences of sigma values, each represented as a part of the original sequence split at the specified step."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can SplitSigmas be useful in processing sigma values?",
        "answer": "SplitSigmas is useful in processing sigma values by allowing differentiated handling of the initial and subsequent parts of the sequence, tailored to specific operational needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of SplitSigmas?",
        "answer": "SplitSigmas belongs to the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/sigmas' in ComfyUI."
