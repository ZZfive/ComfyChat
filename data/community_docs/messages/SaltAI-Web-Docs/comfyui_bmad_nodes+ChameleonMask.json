        "question": "What is the ChameleonMask node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ChameleonMask node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically adapt or modify image masks based on certain criteria or inputs, allowing for flexible and context-sensitive mask manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which mode does ChameleonMask node use for the contrast adjustment of the mask?",
        "answer": "The ChameleonMask node adjusts the contrast of the mask through the 'contrast_adjust' input, which is a float type, enhancing or reducing the mask's visual intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the ChameleonMask node, what does the 'thresh_blur' input define?",
        "answer": "The 'thresh_blur' input in the ChameleonMask node defines the threshold for blurring the mask, affecting the mask's edge smoothness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operation does the 'close_dist' input control in the ChameleonMask node, and how does it affect the mask?",
        "answer": "The 'close_dist' input in the ChameleonMask node specifies the distance for the closing operation on the mask, influencing the mask's compactness."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mask_blur' input in the ChameleonMask node modify the mask?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_blur' input in the ChameleonMask node sets the level of blurring applied to the mask, modifying its softness and transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the ChameleonMask node, what does the 'mode' input specify and what are the options available?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the ChameleonMask node specifies the mode of operation for mask generation, offering different strategies for mask creation. The available options include 'GRAY', 'VALUE', 'LIGHTNESS', 'HUE', 'SATURATION (HSV)', and 'SATURATION (HSL)' among others."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the format of the output from the ChameleonMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output from the ChameleonMask node in ComfyUI is an image with the mask applied, showcased as the result of the mask manipulation, and the format can be determined by the 'output_format' input."
