        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the CR_ModuleInput node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModuleInput node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the flow of data through a pipeline by accepting a variety of inputs and flushing them through the system, serving as a critical junction point in the pipeline to ensure correct data routing and transformation for subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the CR_ModuleInput node primarily expect?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModuleInput node primarily expects the 'pipe' parameter, which acts as the central hub for the input data that will be processed and routed within the pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the CR_ModuleInput node in ComfyUI, including the corresponding Python data types?",
        "answer": "The CR_ModuleInput node outputs include 'pipe' (Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.nn.Module, str, str, torch.Tensor, torch.nn.Module, torch.nn.Module, PIL.Image.Image, int, str]), 'model' (torch.nn.Module), 'pos' (str), 'neg' (str), 'latent' (torch.Tensor), 'vae' (torch.nn.Module), 'clip' (torch.nn.Module), 'controlnet' (torch.nn.Module), 'image' (PIL.Image.Image), 'seed' (int), and 'show_help' (str)."

    {
        "question": "What Python dtype corresponds to the Comfy dtype of IMAGE in the CR_ModuleInput node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype that corresponds to the Comfy dtype of IMAGE in the CR_ModuleInput node is PIL.Image.Image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtypes associated with the node CR_ModuleInput?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtypes associated with the node CR_ModuleInput include PIPE_LINE, MODEL, CONDITIONING (for both 'pos' and 'neg'), LATENT, VAE, CLIP, CONTROL_NET, IMAGE, INT, and STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can you find additional help and documentation for the CR_ModuleInput node?",
        "answer": "Additional help and documentation for the CR_ModuleInput node can be found at https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/Pipe-Nodes#cr-module-input."
