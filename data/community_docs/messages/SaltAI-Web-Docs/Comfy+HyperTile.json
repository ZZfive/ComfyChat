        "question": "What is HyperTile?",
        "answer": "HyperTile is a custom node in ComfyUI categorized under model_patches, designed to dynamically adjust the tile size of input images based on the neural network model's channel configuration and specified tile size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of HyperTile?",
        "answer": "The purpose of HyperTile is to optimize the handling of image data for neural networks by applying a specialized tiling strategy that adapts to the model's characteristics and computational constraints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the HyperTile node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the HyperTile node include 'model', 'tile_size', 'swap_size', 'max_depth', and 'scale_depth'. Each input type has specific Comfy dtype and Python dtype requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does HyperTile determine the tile size?",
        "answer": "HyperTile dynamically adjusts the tile size based on the model's channel configuration and the specified 'tile_size' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_depth' parameter define in HyperTile?",
        "answer": "The 'max_depth' parameter in HyperTile defines the maximum depth for the tiling strategy, influencing how deeply the tiling adjustments can be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of models does HyperTile modify?",
        "answer": "HyperTile modifies neural network models specified by the 'model' parameter, enhancing their processing of image data through an adjusted attention mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does HyperTile enhance the processing of image data?",
        "answer": "HyperTile enhances the processing of image data by optimizing the tiling strategy based on the model's characteristics and computational constraints."
