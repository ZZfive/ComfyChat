        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Explorer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Explorer node is designed for navigating and analyzing latent space, facilitating the exploration and manipulation of parameters to generate or modify content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IG Explorer node are `folder` specified as a `STRING` for the directory containing the job queue and other relevant files for exploration, and `precision` specified as a `FLOAT` for determining the level of detail or accuracy in the exploration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and what does it indicate in the context of IG Explorer node?",
        "answer": "The IG Explorer node outputs both a `FLOAT` value and a `STRING`. The `FLOAT` output indicates a specific point or configuration in the latent space determined through exploration, and the `STRING` output provides the filename of the image generated or identified during the exploration process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class in the IG Explorer source code is responsible for handling the exploration operations?",
        "answer": "The class responsible for handling the exploration operations in the IG Explorer node is the `IG_ExplorerNode` class."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the filename of the image generated by the IG Explorer node determined?",
        "answer": "The filename of the image generated by the IG Explorer node is determined by the `image_filename` function, which formats the parameter to have six digits before the decimal and six digits after, then creates a filename prefixed with `image_` within the specified folder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the IG Explorer node do when it encounters a job with no measured difference?",
        "answer": "When the IG Explorer node encounters a job with no measured difference, it will generate images for both parameters if they do not already exist, then measure the difference using the `measure_difference` function, which employs the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to compare grayscale versions of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the `process_jobs` function in the IG Explorer node finds no more eligible jobs for further exploration?",
        "answer": "When the `process_jobs` function finds no more eligible jobs for further exploration, it will return -1 indicating that the exploration has finished."
