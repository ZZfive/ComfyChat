        "question": "What is the Logic Comparison XOR node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison XOR node in ComfyUI is used to perform an exclusive logical XOR operation on two boolean inputs, returning true if exactly one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Logic Comparison XOR node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison XOR node belongs to the `WAS Suite/Logic` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Logic Comparison XOR node determine its output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison XOR node determines its output by comparing two boolean inputs and returns true if exactly one of them is true, indicating an exclusive disjunction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the inputs to the Logic Comparison XOR node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the inputs to the Logic Comparison XOR node is `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, which node can be used for performing a non-equivalence boolean logic operation?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison XOR node can be used in ComfyUI for performing a non-equivalence boolean logic operation, also known as an exclusive disjunction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the result of the Logic Comparison XOR node if both input boolean values are true?",
        "answer": "If both input boolean values are true, the Logic Comparison XOR node will return `False` in ComfyUI, as it only returns `True` if exactly one of the inputs is `True`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node for Logic Comparison XOR in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node for Logic Comparison XOR in ComfyUI is `False` by default, but it outputs `True` if exactly one of the input boolean values is true."
