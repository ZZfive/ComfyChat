        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBandpassFilter node is used to apply a bandpass filter to an audio input, allowing frequencies within a specified range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node are `audio`, `low_cutoff_frequency`, and `high_cutoff_frequency`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is the `audio` input in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The `audio` input in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node is the raw audio data to be processed, with a Comfy dtype of `AUDIO` and a Python dtype of `bytes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `low_cutoff_frequency` input utilized in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The `low_cutoff_frequency` input is the lower frequency threshold of the bandpass filter. Frequencies below this value will be attenuated, helping to isolate the desired frequency band."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `high_cutoff_frequency` input in the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node?",
        "answer": "The `high_cutoff_frequency` input is the upper frequency threshold of the bandpass filter. Frequencies above this value will be attenuated, further refining the isolation of the desired frequency band."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node output?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBandpassFilter node outputs the processed audio data after the bandpass filter has been applied, with specified frequencies allowed to pass and others attenuated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltAudioBandpassFilter node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBandpassFilter node belongs to the `SALT/Audio/Effect` category in ComfyUI."
