    {
        "question": "What does the 'directory' input represent in the VHS_LoadImages node?",
        "answer": "The 'directory' input in the VHS_LoadImages node specifies the directory from which images are to be loaded, serving as the primary source for the image loading operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the VHS_LoadImages node limit the number of images loaded from a directory?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadImages node can limit the number of images loaded from a directory using its 'image_load_cap' input, which allows for control over the batch size for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VHS_LoadImages node output?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadImages node outputs 'image' data as torch.Tensor images ready for further use, 'mask' data as torch.Tensor masks associated with the images if available, and 'int' data representing the total count of images loaded from the directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes work well with the VHS_LoadImages node in ComfyUI workflows?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that work well with the VHS_LoadImages node in ComfyUI workflows include PreviewImage, Reroute, ScribblePreprocessor, EmptyLatentImage, DWPreprocessor, TilePreprocessor, LineArtPreprocessor, and Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VHS_LoadImages node handle initial images within a directory?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadImages node handles initial images within a directory using the 'skip_first_images' input, which skips a specified number of initial images, allowing the loading process to start from a certain point."
