        "question": "What is the purpose of the convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node is designed to transform individual frame keys into a format suitable for batch processing, facilitating the integration of frame-specific data into batch-oriented workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node belong?",
        "answer": "The convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node belongs to the category of FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/HelperNodes in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `input` parameter represent in the convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node?",
        "answer": "The `input` parameter represents the individual frame key to be transformed, crucial for identifying the specific frame whose data needs to be integrated into a batch process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type (Comfy dtype) of the `num_latents` input in convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys?",
        "answer": "The `num_latents` input in convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys has a Comfy dtype of INT, specifying the total number of latent variables or elements in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output key value calculated in the convertKeyframeKeysToBatchKeys node?",
        "answer": "The output key value is calculated by the formula `c = input * num_latents - 1`, ensuring that the frame's data aligns with the batch's indexing requirements."
    },
