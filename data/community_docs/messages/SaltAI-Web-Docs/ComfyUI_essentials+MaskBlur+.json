        "question": "What node in ComfyUI is designed to soften the edges of a mask using a Gaussian blur effect?",
        "answer": "The MaskBlur+ node in ComfyUI is designed to soften the edges of a mask using a Gaussian blur effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for specifying the intensity of the blur effect in the MaskBlur+ node?",
        "answer": "The input type for specifying the intensity of the blur effect in the MaskBlur+ node is `amount`, which is of dtype `FLOAT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype does the MaskBlur+ node use for its `mask` input?",
        "answer": "The MaskBlur+ node uses the Python dtype `torch.Tensor` for its `mask` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `amount` input parameter control in the MaskBlur+ node?",
        "answer": "The `amount` input parameter in the MaskBlur+ node controls the intensity of the blur effect, with a higher value resulting in a more pronounced blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes can work in conjunction with MaskBlur+?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that can work in conjunction with MaskBlur+ include IPAdapterApply, MaskToImage, and Masks Subtract."
