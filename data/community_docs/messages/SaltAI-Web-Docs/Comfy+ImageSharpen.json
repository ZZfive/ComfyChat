        "question": "What is ImageSharpen?",
        "answer": "ImageSharpen is a node in ComfyUI designed for enhancing the clarity of images by applying a sharpening filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageSharpen node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageSharpen node enhances the clarity of images by applying a sharpening filter, which accentuates edges and details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageSharpen node include 'image' of type torch.Tensor, 'sharpen_radius' of type int defining the radius of the sharpening effect, 'sigma' of type float determining the spread of the Gaussian kernel, and 'alpha' of type float controlling the intensity of sharpening."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'sharpen_radius' parameter affect the ImageSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpen_radius' parameter in ImageSharpen defines the radius of the sharpening effect, influencing the area around edges that are enhanced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigma' parameter control in the ImageSharpen node?",
        "answer": "In the ImageSharpen node, the 'sigma' parameter controls the spread of the Gaussian kernel used for sharpening, affecting the smoothness and localization of the sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'alpha' parameter in the ImageSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The 'alpha' parameter in the ImageSharpen node adjusts the intensity of the sharpening effect, with higher values producing a more pronounced enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageSharpen node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageSharpen node is 'image', which is a torch.Tensor representing the sharpened image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used alongside ImageSharpen?",
        "answer": "Common nodes often used alongside ImageSharpen include PreviewImage, IPAdapterApplyFaceID, IPAdapterApply, ImageUpscaleWithModel, and UltimateSDUpscale."
