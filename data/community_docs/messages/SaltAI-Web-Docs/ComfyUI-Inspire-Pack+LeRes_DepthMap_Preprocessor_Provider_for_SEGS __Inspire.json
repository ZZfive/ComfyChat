        "question": "What is the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI is used for preprocessing depth map images using the LeReS algorithm, specifically tailored for the SEGS framework. It removes nearest and background elements from the depth map and optionally boosts the remaining features to enhance depth perception for subsequent processing stages."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI offers preprocessing capabilities for depth map images using the LeReS algorithm?",
        "answer": "The LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS node in ComfyUI offers preprocessing capabilities for depth map images using the LeReS algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rm_nearest' parameter control in the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The 'rm_nearest' parameter in the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS controls the extent to which the nearest elements in the depth map are removed, affecting the clarity and focus of the depth map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input parameter 'rm_background' in the LeReS DepthMap Preprocessor Provider for SEGS and what does it determine?",
        "answer": "The data type of the input parameter 'rm_background' in the LeReS DepthMap Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is FLOAT. It determines the degree to which background elements are removed from the depth map, enhancing the depth map's overall quality by focusing on relevant features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'boost' parameter in the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS, and what is its default value?",
        "answer": "The 'boost' parameter in the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is a boolean flag that, when enabled, boosts the features of the depth map after removing nearest and background elements. Its default value is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS and in which framework is it ready for further processing?",
        "answer": "The output of the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is a preprocessed depth map object of type SEGS_PREPROCESSOR, ready for further processing within the SEGS framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LeReS Depth Map Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is classified in the category 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' within ComfyUI."
