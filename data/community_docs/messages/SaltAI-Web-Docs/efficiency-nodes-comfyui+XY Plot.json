    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the cache_models input to True in the XY Plot node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Setting the cache_models input to True in the XY Plot node indicates that model data should be cached for efficiency, reducing load times for repeated plot generations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is used as a reference or base for the XY plot in the XY Plot node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ksampler_output_image input is used as a reference or base for the XY plot in the XY Plot node of ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the XY Plot node in ComfyUI return when executed?",
        "answer": "The XY Plot node in ComfyUI returns a dictionary containing the script configuration for the XY plot, including plot parameters and data points, with the output type being SCRIPT."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be considered as a common node associated with the XY Plot node?",
        "answer": "The KSampler SDXL (Eff.) node is considered a common node associated with the XY Plot node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the XY Plot node in ComfyUI, what data type is associated with the X and Y inputs?",
        "answer": "In the context of the XY Plot node, the X and Y inputs, if connected, have the Comfy dtype of XY, which refers to the X or Y axis data points in the plot."
