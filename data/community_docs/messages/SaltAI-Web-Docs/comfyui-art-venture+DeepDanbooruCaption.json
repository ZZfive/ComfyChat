        "question": "What is the purpose of the DeepDanbooruCaption node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DeepDanbooruCaption node in ComfyUI is designed to generate captions for images using the DeepDanbooru model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What primary input is required by the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the DeepDanbooruCaption node is `image`, which is the image to be captioned."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does DeepDanbooruCaption determine the inclusion of tags in the image caption?",
        "answer": "DeepDanbooruCaption determines the inclusion of tags in the image caption based on a confidence threshold set by the `threshold` parameter. Tags with confidence below this threshold are excluded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sort_alpha` input of the DeepDanbooruCaption node control?",
        "answer": "The `sort_alpha` input of the DeepDanbooruCaption node controls whether the tags should be sorted alphabetically in the caption."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input allows the DeepDanbooruCaption node to add extra text before and after the generated caption?",
        "answer": "The DeepDanbooruCaption node can add extra text before and after the generated caption through the `prefix` and `suffix` inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `filter_tags` input do in the DeepDanbooruCaption node?",
        "answer": "The `filter_tags` input in the DeepDanbooruCaption node is a list of tags to be excluded from the captions generated for the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the DeepDanbooruCaption node configured to run on specific hardware?",
        "answer": "The DeepDanbooruCaption node is configured to run on specific hardware, such as CPU or GPU, through the `device_mode` input."
