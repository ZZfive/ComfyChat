        "question": "What is the Save Gif (mtb) node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Save Gif (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to save a sequence of images as a GIF file, offering customization options such as frame rate, size adjustment, optimization, and the choice of using FFmpeg for potentially enhanced performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the 'image' parameter of the Save Gif (mtb) node require?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter of the Save Gif (mtb) node requires a sequence of images to be saved as a GIF. This is the primary input that dictates the content of the resulting GIF file and is of Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the frame rate affect the final GIF file when using the Save Gif (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The frame rate, specified by the 'fps' parameter, controls how fast the images in the sequence are played back and is therefore crucial in determining the smoothness of the final GIF animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does resizing images by a factor specified in the Save Gif (mtb) node achieve?",
        "answer": "Resizing images by a factor specified in the Save Gif (mtb) node allows for size adjustment of the images in the GIF, with 1.0 meaning no scaling. The 'resize_by' parameter is of type FLOAT in Comfy and float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the GIF file be optimized for size before saving using the Save Gif (mtb) node, and what is the trade-off?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'optimize' parameter, of type BOOLEAN in both Comfy and Python, indicates whether to apply optimization to the GIF, which can reduce file size but might also increase processing times."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'pingpong' parameter in the Save Gif (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "When enabled, the 'pingpong' parameter in the Save Gif (mtb) node causes the GIF animation to play forwards and then backwards, thus creating a seamless loop effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'resample_filter' parameter have on image quality during resizing with the Save Gif (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'resample_filter' parameter in the Save Gif (mtb) node, of type COMBO[STRING] in Comfy and Optional[str] in Python, determines the resampling filter to use when resizing images, which can affect the quality of the resized images."
