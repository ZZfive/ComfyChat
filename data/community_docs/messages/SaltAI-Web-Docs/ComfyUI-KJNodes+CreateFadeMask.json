        "question": "What is the CreateFadeMask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMask node in ComfyUI is used to generate fade masks for images or sequences, allowing for smooth transitions between frames or visual elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CreateFadeMask node affect the size of the generated mask?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMask node affects the size of the generated mask through the 'width' and 'height' parameters, which determine the dimensions of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter do in the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node is a boolean flag that, when set to true, inverts the fade effect, offering an alternative visual transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which algorithm does the CreateFadeMask node use for generating the fade effect when 'interpolation' is set to 'ease_in'?",
        "answer": "When 'interpolation' is set to 'ease_in', the CreateFadeMask node uses an algorithm where the fade effect starts slowly and accelerates through time, specified by the ease_in(t) function where t is the time normalized between 0 and 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'midpoint_frame' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'midpoint_frame' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node specifies the frame at which the midpoint opacity level is reached, influencing the timing of the fade's progression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'frames' parameter in the CreateFadeMask node is 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used to create smooth transitions between images or sequences in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CreateFadeMask node is one of the nodes that can be used to create smooth transitions between images or sequences in ComfyUI."
