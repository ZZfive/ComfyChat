        "question": "What is SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "SAG delayed activation is a custom implementation of Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) in ComfyUI, designed to enhance neural network models by dynamically adjusting attention mechanisms based on conditional inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "The purpose of SAG delayed activation is to improve model performance by modifying attention layers to incorporate additional guidance, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generate or process data with greater precision and relevance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SAG delayed activation include the neural network model (`MODEL`), a scaling factor (`FLOAT`) that adjusts the SAG effect intensity, the standard deviation (`FLOAT`) for Gaussian blur used in adversarial blurring, and starting and ending sigma values (`FLOAT`) that define the operational range for applying SAG modifications."

    {
        "question": "How does SAG delayed activation adjust attention mechanisms?",
        "answer": "SAG delayed activation adjusts attention mechanisms by using a custom implementation of Self-Attention Guidance (SAG), modifying the neural network model's attention layers based on conditional inputs such as scaling factor, blur sigma, and sigma start/end values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "SAG delayed activation belongs to the `model_patches` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name for SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "The Python class name for SAG delayed activation is `SelfAttentionGuidanceCustom`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is recommended for using SAG delayed activation?",
        "answer": "Using SAG delayed activation typically requires `GPU` infrastructure."
