        "question": "What is the purpose of the Compare node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Compare node in ComfyUI is designed to evaluate the relationship between two inputs based on a specified comparison operation (e.g., equality, inequality, greater than, less than) allowing users to dynamically assess and act upon the conditions of their data or variables."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Compare node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Compare node belongs to the Logic category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'comparison' input of the Compare node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'comparison' input of the Compare node determines the type of comparison to perform between the two inputs (e.g., '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', '>='). This input directly influences the result by specifying the logic applied for comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Compare node output?",
        "answer": "The Compare node outputs a BOOLEAN value indicating the result of the comparison operation, specifying whether the specified condition between the two inputs holds true or not."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of values can the 'a' and 'b' inputs of the Compare node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'a' and 'b' inputs of the Compare node can accept any type of value as they are set to the dtype `*` in ComfyUI, meaning they can accept any type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the logic for comparison implemented in the Compare node's source code?",
        "answer": "The logic for comparison in the Compare node's source code is implemented using the `compare_functions` dictionary that maps comparison operators to corresponding functions. The `compare` method selects the appropriate function from `COMPARE_FUNCTIONS` based on the 'comparison' input and applies it to the 'a' and 'b' inputs to return a Boolean result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Compare node run on?",
        "answer": "The Compare node runs on the 'CPU' infrastructure as specified in the 'Usage tips' section."
