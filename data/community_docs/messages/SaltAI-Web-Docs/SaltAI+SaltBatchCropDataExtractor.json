        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node in ComfyUI is designed to process a batch of crop data, extracting specific crop information and dimensions for a given index within the batch. It facilitates the manipulation and analysis of crop data by providing detailed metrics such as width, height, and boundary coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node belongs to the 'SALT/Masking/Process' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node is 'crop_data_batch', which represents the batch of crop data to be processed. It is essential for determining the specific crop information and dimensions to be extracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input 'index' used for in the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The 'index' input in the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node dictates the specific crop data within the batch to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node provide?",
        "answer": "The SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node provides outputs including 'crop_data_batch', 'width', 'height', 'top', 'left', 'right', and 'bottom', which correspond to the extracted crop data for the specified index, including size and boundary coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what situation will the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node throw a ValueError?",
        "answer": "The SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node will throw a ValueError if the provided 'index' is out of the range of the 'crop_data_batch'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'single_crop_data' returned by the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node consist of?",
        "answer": "The 'single_crop_data' returned by the SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node consists of a tuple for 'crop_size' and a tuple for the boundary coordinates (crop_left, crop_top, crop_right, crop_bottom) of the crop area."
