        "question": "What is the purpose of the Make Interpolation State List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Make Interpolation State List node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a list of interpolation states based on provided frame indices and a skip list flag, facilitating the setup for subsequent video frame interpolation operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Make Interpolation State List node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Make Interpolation State List node belongs to the category ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/VFI in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type determines which frames are considered for interpolation in the Make Interpolation State List node?",
        "answer": "The frame_indices input type, which is a string of comma-separated numbers, determines which frames are considered for interpolation in the Make Interpolation State List node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the skip list flag used in the Make Interpolation State List node?",
        "answer": "The skip list flag, represented by the is_skip_list input type, is a boolean that indicates whether certain frames should be skipped in the interpolation process, enabling more control over the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Make Interpolation State List node provide?",
        "answer": "The Make Interpolation State List node provides an output of type INTERPOLATION_STATES, which is a list of states that represent the configuration for frame interpolation, including which frames to interpolate and whether to skip certain frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the interpolation_states output in the Make Interpolation State List node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the interpolation_states output in the Make Interpolation State List node is InterpolationStateList."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the Make Interpolation State List node support?",
        "answer": "The Make Interpolation State List node supports CPU infrastructure."
