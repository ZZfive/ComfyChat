        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a list into an iterative execution list, facilitating the conversion of scheduling data into a format suitable for sequential processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node require?",
        "answer": "The SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node requires a list_input, which represents the input list to be converted into an iterative execution list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node is a list of floats derived from the input list, indicating the transformed scheduling data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node belong to in ComfyUI's node library?",
        "answer": "The SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node belongs to the SALT/Scheduling category in ComfyUI's node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node run on GPU hardware?",
        "answer": "No, the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node uses the CPU infrastructure, not GPU, for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node support list input data types in Python?",
        "answer": "Yes, the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node supports list input data types in Python, where the Comfy dtype is LIST and the Python dtype is List."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node function return?",
        "answer": "The SaltSchedule2ExecSchedule node function returns a tuple containing the transformed list_input as its only element, when the convert method is called on this class."
