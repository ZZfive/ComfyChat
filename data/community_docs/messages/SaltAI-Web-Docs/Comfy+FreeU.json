        "question": "What is FreeU in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "FreeU is a custom node in ComfyUI categorized under model_patches. It modifies the output of generative models by applying a Fourier filter to adjust frequency components of generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does FreeU enhance generative models?",
        "answer": "FreeU enhances generative models by adjusting higher and lower frequency components of images using scale factors b1 and b2, and threshold parameters s1 and s2, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for FreeU?",
        "answer": "The required input types for FreeU include the generative model 'model', and scale factors 'b1' and 'b2' along with threshold parameters 's1' and 's2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the scale factors b1 and b2 in FreeU?",
        "answer": "The scale factors b1 and b2 in FreeU adjust the intensity of higher and lower frequency components of the generative model's output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does FreeU modify the generative model's output?",
        "answer": "FreeU modifies the generative model's output by patching its output block to apply a Fourier filter, enhancing or altering the images based on specified scale and threshold parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does FreeU belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "FreeU belongs to the 'model_patches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'patch' method in FreeU?",
        "answer": "The 'patch' method in FreeU applies a Fourier filter to adjust frequency components of the generative model's output images, enhancing their quality or introducing specific effects."
