        "question": "What is the Tiled Upscaler Script node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Tiled Upscaler Script node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image resolution through a process of tiled sampling and upscaling, leveraging various upscaling strategies for efficiency and improved image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the Tiled Upscaler Script node determine the upscale factor and tile size?",
        "answer": "The parameters that determine the upscale factor and tile size in the Tiled Upscaler Script node are 'upscale_by' and 'tile_size', respectively. 'upscale_by' specifies the factor for resolution enhancement, and 'tile_size' determines the tile size used in the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'tiling_strategy' parameter in the Tiled Upscaler Script node?",
        "answer": "The 'tiling_strategy' parameter in the Tiled Upscaler Script node defines the approach for tiling during the upscaling process, influencing how the image is segmented and processed for better resolution enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Tiled Upscaler Script node in ComfyUI apply denoise filters during the upscaling process?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Tiled Upscaler Script node can apply denoise filters during the upscaling process. This is determined by the 'denoise' parameter, which when enabled, enhances image clarity by reducing noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_controlnet' parameter do in the Tiled Upscaler Script node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_controlnet' parameter in the Tiled Upscaler Script node determines whether a control net is used in the upscaling process, potentially allowing for more precise and guided upscaling results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Tiled Upscaler Script node's output be further processed in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Tiled Upscaler Script node's output can be further processed in ComfyUI by taking the returned 'script' parameter, which includes upscaling parameters ready for additional operations within the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is recommended for running the Tiled Upscaler Script node efficiently?",
        "answer": "The Tiled Upscaler Script node is recommended to be run on a GPU infrastructure for optimal performance. This allows efficient handling of the computationally intensive task of upscaling images by tiling and segmentation."
