        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMQueryEngine node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMQueryEngine node in ComfyUI is designed to process and execute queries using a language model, integrating vector indexing and similarity postprocessing to retrieve relevant responses. It leverages language models to understand and respond to user queries, applying advanced retrieval techniques to ensure the responses are both relevant and contextually appropriate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the mandatory input types for the LLMQueryEngine node?",
        "answer": "The mandatory input types for the LLMQueryEngine node are `llm_model`, which represents the language model and optional embedding model used for processing queries, and `llm_index`, the index used for retrieving vector embeddings, essential for identifying relevant documents or entries based on the query."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in LLMQueryEngine node is used for user's query input?",
        "answer": "The input type `query` in the LLMQueryEngine node is used for the user's query input, which is processed by the engine to find relevant information or answers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of information does the LLMQueryEngine node output?",
        "answer": "The LLMQueryEngine node outputs a `results` type which encapsulates the processed query response, representing the relevance and context of the information retrieved by the engine."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LLMQueryEngine handle optional messages in query processing?",
        "answer": "The LLMQueryEngine node can process a list of optional messages, `llm_message`, which can be included in the query context, potentially enhancing the model's understanding of the user's intent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type preferred for the LLMQueryEngine node execution?",
        "answer": "The preferred infrastructure type for executing the LLMQueryEngine node is `GPU`, which can optimize the processing and retrieval of information based on user queries."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which section of the ComfyUI toolkit can the LLMQueryEngine node be found?",
        "answer": "The LLMQueryEngine node can be found in the category `SALT/Language Toolkit/Querying` of the ComfyUI toolkit."
