        "question": "What is CM_Vec2ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ScalarOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs scalar operations on a 2-dimensional vector, applying specified operations like multiplication or division between the vector and a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2ScalarOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ScalarOperation belongs to the category 'math/vec2' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec2ScalarOperation's 'op' method do?",
        "answer": "The 'op' method in CM_Vec2ScalarOperation performs the specified scalar operation on the vector 'a' using the scalar value 'b', modifying the vector accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec2ScalarOperation abstract vector arithmetic?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ScalarOperation abstracts vector arithmetic by simplifying complex operations into reusable logic for 2-dimensional vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec2ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_Vec2ScalarOperation are: 'op' (specifies the scalar operation), 'a' (the 2-dimensional vector), and 'b' (the scalar value used in the operation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does CM_Vec2ScalarOperation provide?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ScalarOperation provides an output type of 'VEC2', which is the resulting 2-dimensional vector after applying the scalar operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of CM_Vec2ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of CM_Vec2ScalarOperation is 'tuple[Vec2]'."
