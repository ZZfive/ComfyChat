        "question": "What is PerturbedAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "PerturbedAttentionGuidance is a custom node in ComfyUI that introduces a method to modify the attention mechanism within a given model by applying a perturbation function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the PerturbedAttentionGuidance node aim to enhance?",
        "answer": "The PerturbedAttentionGuidance node aims to enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features by adjusting the attention weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does PerturbedAttentionGuidance require?",
        "answer": "PerturbedAttentionGuidance requires 'model' and 'scale' parameters. 'model' represents the neural network model to apply the perturbed attention guidance, and 'scale' controls the intensity of the perturbation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'scale' parameter control in PerturbedAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' parameter in PerturbedAttentionGuidance controls the intensity of the perturbation applied to the attention mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does PerturbedAttentionGuidance modify attention weights?",
        "answer": "PerturbedAttentionGuidance modifies attention weights by replacing self-attention with a perturbed attention function defined by 'perturbed_attention'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of PerturbedAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "The output of PerturbedAttentionGuidance is a modified version of the input model, where the attention mechanism has been perturbed according to the specified scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of PerturbedAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "PerturbedAttentionGuidance belongs to the '_for_testing' category."
