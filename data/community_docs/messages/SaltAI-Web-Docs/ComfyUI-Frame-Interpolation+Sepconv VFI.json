        "question": "What is the Sepconv VFI node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Sepconv VFI node in ComfyUI is designed for video frame interpolation, utilizing separable convolutional networks to enhance the smoothness and quality of interpolated frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Sepconv VFI node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Sepconv VFI node include `ckpt_name`, `frames`, `clear_cache_after_n_frames`, and `multiplier`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ckpt_name` parameter do in the Sepconv VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` parameter in the Sepconv VFI node specifies the checkpoint name for the model, which is crucial for loading the correct pretrained weights and ensuring the model operates as expected."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can increase the frame rate of a video by generating intermediate frames?",
        "answer": "The Sepconv VFI node in ComfyUI can increase the frame rate of a video by generating intermediate frames between existing ones."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input types does the Sepconv VFI node have?",
        "answer": "The Sepconv VFI node has an optional input type `optional_interpolation_states` which allows for passing optional states that may affect the interpolation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `multiplier` parameter control in the Sepconv VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `multiplier` parameter in the Sepconv VFI node defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly affecting the output video's frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Sepconv VFI node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Sepconv VFI node in ComfyUI is the interpolated video frames, enhanced in smoothness and quality through the sepconv VFI process."
