        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Divide node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Divide node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the division of two numerical values, offering a convenient method to execute arithmetic division operations within a node-based programming environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the DivideNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the DivideNode in ComfyUI is `DF_Divide`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the DF_Divide node belong to?",
        "answer": "The DF_Divide node is part of the `Derfuu_Nodes/Math` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types are required by the DF_Divide node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Divide node requires two input types: `Numerator` which is the dividend in the division operation, and `Denominator` which is the divisor affecting the outcome by dividing the numerator."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Divide node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Divide node is `FLOAT`, representing the result of dividing the Numerator by the Denominator, expressed as a floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is the DF_Divide node compatible with?",
        "answer": "The DF_Divide node in ComfyUI is compatible with the `CPU` infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the inputs and output of the DF_Divide node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types for the inputs `Numerator` and `Denominator` are `float`, and the output type, which represents the division result, is also `float`."
