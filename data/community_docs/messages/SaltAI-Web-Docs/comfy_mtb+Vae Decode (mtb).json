    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `Vae Decode (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `Vae Decode (mtb)` node are `samples` (LATENT), `vae` (VAE), `seamless_model` (BOOLEAN), `use_tiling_decoder` (BOOLEAN), and `tile_size` (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the `Vae Decode (mtb)` node, what does the `samples` input represent?",
        "answer": "In the context of the `Vae Decode (mtb)` node, the `samples` input represents the latent representations to be decoded into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What functionality does the `vae` input provide in the `Vae Decode (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The `vae` input provides the VAE model used for decoding the latent representations into images."

    {
        "question": "How does the `seamless_model` input affect the output of `Vae Decode (mtb)`?",
        "answer": "The `seamless_model` input indicates whether to use seamless mode for decoding, which adjusts the padding mode of convolutional layers for seamless image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `use_tiling_decoder` input in `Vae Decode (mtb)`?",
        "answer": "The `use_tiling_decoder` input determines whether to use a tiling decoder for image generation, enabling efficient handling of larger images by processing them in tiles."
