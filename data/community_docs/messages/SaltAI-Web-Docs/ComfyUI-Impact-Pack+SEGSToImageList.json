        "question": "What is the purpose of the SEGSToImageList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSToImageList node is designed to convert segmentation data into a list of images, providing a flexible way to handle segmentation outputs for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SEGSToImageList node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSToImageList node belongs to the category `ImpactPack/Util` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the primary required input `segs` in SEGSToImageList handle?",
        "answer": "The primary required input `segs` in SEGSToImageList handles segmentation data, which is essential for the operation as it holds the segments to be converted into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SEGSToImageList node handle the scaling of segmentation data when a fallback image is provided?",
        "answer": "When a fallback image is provided, the SEGSToImageList node ensures that the segmentation data is appropriately scaled to align with the fallback image's dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SEGSToImageList node output and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The SEGSToImageList node outputs a list of images extracted from the segmentation data. Each image corresponds to a cropped area from the original segmentation, potentially adjusted for scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `fallback_image_opt` input in SEGSToImageList?",
        "answer": "The `fallback_image_opt` input in SEGSToImageList is an optional image used to match the scale of segmentation data. If provided, it ensures that the segmentation data is scaled to align with the dimensions of the fallback image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function called inside the class `SEGSToImageList`'s source code that processes the input and generates the output?",
        "answer": "The function called inside the class `SEGSToImageList`'s source code that processes the input and generates the output is `doit`."
