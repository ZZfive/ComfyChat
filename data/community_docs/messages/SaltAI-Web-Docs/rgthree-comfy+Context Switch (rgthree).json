        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Switch (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Switch (rgthree) node is designed to streamline context management by selecting the first non-empty context from a set of provided contexts, ensuring efficient determination of an active context for subsequent operations and facilitating smoother transitions within various processing flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtypes for the outputs of the Context Switch (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtypes for the outputs of the Context Switch (rgthree) node include RGTHREE_CONTEXT for the comprehensive context output, MODEL, CLIP, VAE, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, LATENT, IMAGE, and INT for SEED."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Context Switch (rgthree) determine which context to output?",
        "answer": "Context Switch (rgthree) evaluates each provided context in sequence until it finds the first non-empty one to output. This approach allows for flexible and dynamic context switching based on the availability of content within the contexts."

    {
        "question": "What is the function used by the RgthreeContextSwitch class to choose the first non-empty context?",
        "answer": "The RgthreeContextSwitch class uses the switch function to choose the first non-empty context from the provided options."
