        "question": "What is the ImpactStringSelector node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactStringSelector node in ComfyUI is designed to select a specific string or a set of strings from a given multiline string input based on user-defined criteria, facilitating text manipulation and processing tasks within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactStringSelector node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactStringSelector node are: `strings` (a multiline string from which specific strings are to be selected), `multiline` (a boolean flag indicating whether to treat each line separately), and `select` (an integer specifying the index of the string to select)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the multiline input type affect the processing of strings in ImpactStringSelector?",
        "answer": "The `multiline` input type in ImpactStringSelector, when set to True, indicates that the selection should consider each line as a separate entity rather than treating the entire input as a single string, affecting how the selection process is made from the string input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactStringSelector node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactStringSelector node is `string`, which is the selected string or line based on the specified index and criteria after processing the input string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the select input in ImpactStringSelector?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the `select` input in ImpactStringSelector is `INT`."

        "question": "What is the default value for the multiline input in ImpactStringSelector?",
        "answer": "The default value for the `multiline` input in ImpactStringSelector is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `select` input in ImpactStringSelector?",
        "answer": "The `select` input in ImpactStringSelector specifies the index of the string or line to be selected from the input, determining which part of the multiline input is extracted and returned by the node."
