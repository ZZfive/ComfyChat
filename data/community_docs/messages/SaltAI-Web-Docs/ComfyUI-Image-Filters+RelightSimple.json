        "question": "What is the RelightSimple node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The RelightSimple node in ComfyUI is used to adjust the lighting of an image based on provided normal maps and directional light parameters, enabling dynamic relighting effects that simulate different lighting conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the RelightSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the RelightSimple node in ComfyUI is `RelightSimple`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the RelightSimple node belong to in the ComfyUI node framework?",
        "answer": "The RelightSimple node belongs to the `image/filters` category in the ComfyUI node framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main purpose of the `image` input in the RelightSimple node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in the RelightSimple node serves as the base for lighting adjustments, which is the input image to be relit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does `normals` input in the RelightSimple node expect?",
        "answer": "The `normals` input in the RelightSimple node expects normal maps corresponding to the input image, which are used to calculate how light interacts with the surface."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `brightness` parameter in the RelightSimple node function?",
        "answer": "The `brightness` parameter in the RelightSimple node controls the intensity of the light source, enabling the adjustment of brighter or dimmer lighting effects in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RelightSimple node in terms of image processing?",
        "answer": "The output of the RelightSimple node is an image with adjusted lighting based on the provided normals and light direction parameters."
