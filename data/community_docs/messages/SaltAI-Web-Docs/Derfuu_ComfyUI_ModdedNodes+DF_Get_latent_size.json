        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Get_latent_size node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node in ComfyUI is designed to calculate and return the dimensions of a latent representation, either in its original size or scaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types are required for the DF_Get_latent_size node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node requires two input types: 'latent' which represents the data structure for which the size is being calculated, and 'original', a boolean parameter that dictates whether the original size of the latent is returned or if it is scaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent' input represent in the DF_Get_latent_size node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' input represents the data structure for which the size is being calculated. It is crucial for determining the dimensions based on the latent's current state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'original' input in the DF_Get_latent_size node?",
        "answer": "The 'original' input is a boolean parameter that dictates whether the original size of the latent is returned or if it is scaled. It affects the calculation by potentially altering the dimensions returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the DF_Get_latent_size node provide?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node provides 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT' as output types, which represent the width and height dimensions of the latent's size respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node is used for calculating the size of a latent representation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The node used for calculating the size of a latent representation in ComfyUI is the DF_Get_latent_size node."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the DF_Get_latent_size node belong?",
        "answer": "The DF_Get_latent_size node belongs to the 'Derfuu_Nodes/Functions' category."
