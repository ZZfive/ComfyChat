        "question": "What is the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node in ComfyUI designed for?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node in ComfyUI is designed to generate Voronoi noise-based visual patterns that can evolve over time based on various scheduled parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of visual effects is SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise tailored for?",
        "answer": "SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise is tailored for dynamic and evolving visual effects, which can be responsive to audio or other time-varying inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter in SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise specify?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter specifies the number of noise patterns to generate in one execution, supporting batch processing of noise generation in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'distance_metric' parameter in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node?",
        "answer": "The 'distance_metric' parameter in the SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise node defines the metric used to calculate distances in the Voronoi diagram, which influences the shape and distribution of cells in the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'device' parameter in SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise specify, and how does it affect performance?",
        "answer": "The 'device' parameter specifies the computing device (CPU or GPU) where the noise generation process will be executed in SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise, which affects performance and capability, with GPU potentially offering faster processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise allow for the scheduling of noise attributes over time?",
        "answer": "The parameters 'x_schedule', 'y_schedule', 'scale_schedule', 'detail_schedule', 'randomness_schedule', and 'seed_schedule' in SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise allow for the scheduling of various noise attributes over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise output, and in what form?",
        "answer": "SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise outputs Voronoi noise patterns as a batch of images, with the data type being 'IMAGE' and represented as 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output from SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise confirms the size of the batch processed, and what are the data types?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' output from SaltScheduledVoronoiNoise confirms the size of the batch processed, with the data type being 'INT' in ComfyUI and 'int' in Python."
