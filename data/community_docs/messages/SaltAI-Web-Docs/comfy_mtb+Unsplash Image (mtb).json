        "question": "What is the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node is designed to fetch and return an image from Unsplash based on specified dimensions and optional keywords, utilizing the Unsplash API to dynamically source images tailored by the user through parameters such as image size and thematic keywords."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `width` input parameter specify in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The `width` input parameter specifies the desired width of the image to be fetched, directly influencing the resolution of the returned image and impacting its clarity and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `height` input affect the image in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The `height` input parameter determines the height of the image to be fetched, affecting the resolution and aspect ratio of the resulting image just like the width parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `random_seed` parameter in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The `random_seed` parameter is a seed value to introduce randomness in the image selection process of the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node, ensuring that requests for images are not deterministic and can vary with each call."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameter allows users to narrow down the image search in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node?",
        "answer": "The optional `keyword` parameter allows users to specify a keyword to narrow down the image search in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node, making the results more relevant to the desired theme or context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What format is the image output by the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node in?",
        "answer": "The image output by the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node is in the `torch.Tensor` format, suitable for further processing or display within the node's operational context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the `do_unsplash_image` method serve in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node's source code?",
        "answer": "The `do_unsplash_image` method in the `Unsplash Image (mtb)` node's source code is responsible for fetching an image from Unsplash given the specified dimensions and optional keyword, and returns the image in a `torch.Tensor` format suitable for processing and display."
