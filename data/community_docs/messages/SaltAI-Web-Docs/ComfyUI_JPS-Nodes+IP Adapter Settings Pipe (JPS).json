    {
        "question": "What settings does the `ip_adapter_settings` input specify in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe (JPS)?",
        "answer": "The `ip_adapter_settings` input specifies settings for image processing adaptation, including weights, types, noise levels, start and stop points, cropping preferences, zoom levels, offsets, mask types, interpolation methods, sharpening levels, and model types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ipa_weight` output represent in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe (JPS)?",
        "answer": "The `ipa_weight` output in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe represents the weight factor applied to the image processing settings, influencing the intensity of the applied effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type for `ipa_wtype` in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe (JPS)?",
        "answer": "The `ipa_wtype` output in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe is of type `COMBO[STRING]` and represents the type of weight application method used in the image processing settings, such as linear or ease in-out."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `ipa_noise` output contribute to image processing in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe (JPS)?",
        "answer": "The `ipa_noise` output in the IP Adapter Settings Pipe contributes to image processing by specifying the level of noise to be applied to the image as part of the processing settings."
    },
    {
