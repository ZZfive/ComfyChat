        "question": "What is the purpose of the AutoNegativePrompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AutoNegativePrompt node in ComfyUI is designed to automatically generate a negative prompt based on a given positive prompt and various parameters, potentially enhancing the negativity of the prompt based on the input parameters and the specified base model to guide generative models in producing content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the AutoNegativePrompt node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the AutoNegativePrompt node is `AutoNegativePrompt`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category of nodes does the AutoNegativePrompt node fall?",
        "answer": "The AutoNegativePrompt node falls under the category `OneButtonPrompt`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node for AutoNegativePrompt in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node for AutoNegativePrompt in ComfyUI is of boolean value `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in AutoNegativePrompt indicates the level of randomness or 'insanity' in the generated negative prompt?",
        "answer": "The input parameter `insanitylevel` in AutoNegativePrompt indicates the level of randomness or 'insanity' in the generated negative prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is reproducibility of the generated negative prompt ensured in AutoNegativePrompt?",
        "answer": "Reproducibility of the generated negative prompt in AutoNegativePrompt is ensured by specifying a seed value for random number generation through the `seed` input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the `enhancenegative` and `insanitylevel` parameters in AutoNegativePrompt?",
        "answer": "The `enhancenegative` parameter in AutoNegativePrompt has a Comfy dtype of `INT` (Python dtype: `bool`) and the `insanitylevel` parameter has a Comfy dtype of `INT` (Python dtype: `int`), indicating a boolean flag for enhancing the negative prompt and an integer to determine the level of randomness, respectively."
