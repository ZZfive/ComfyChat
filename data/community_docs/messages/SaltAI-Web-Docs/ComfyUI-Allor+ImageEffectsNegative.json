        "question": "What is ImageEffectsNegative?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsNegative is a custom node in ComfyUI that transforms images into their negative form by inverting the colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageEffectsNegative node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageEffectsNegative node transforms images into their negative form by inverting the colors of each color channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageEffectsNegative achieve its effect?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsNegative achieves its effect by subtracting each color channel value from the maximum possible value, thereby creating a photographic negative effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ImageEffectsNegative?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsNegative requires input images to be transformed into their negative form. These images are crucial for the node's operation and are of type Comfy dtype: IMAGE and Python dtype: torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ImageEffectsNegative?",
        "answer": "The output of ImageEffectsNegative is images transformed into their negative form, maintaining Comfy dtype: IMAGE and Python dtype: torch.Tensor."
    },
