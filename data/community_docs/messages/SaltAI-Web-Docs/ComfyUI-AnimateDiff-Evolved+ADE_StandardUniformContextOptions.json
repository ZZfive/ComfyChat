        "question": "What is ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions is a class in ComfyUI designed for creating a uniform set of context options used in animation difference processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions allow customization of?",
        "answer": "ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions allows customization of context length, stride, overlap, fuse method, use on equal length, start percentage, guarantee steps, previous context, and view options."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does context_length influence animation processing?",
        "answer": "context_length specifies the length of the context for animation difference processing, affecting the granularity and scope of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does context_overlap define?",
        "answer": "context_overlap defines the amount of overlap between contexts, influencing the continuity and smoothness of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of fuse_method in ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions?",
        "answer": "fuse_method specifies the method used to fuse multiple contexts together, impacting the visual coherence of the final animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does start_percent contribute to animation initiation?",
        "answer": "start_percent determines the starting point of the animation as a percentage, providing precise control over the initiation of the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does guarantee_steps ensure in animation?",
        "answer": "guarantee_steps defines the minimum number of steps guaranteed within the animation, ensuring a certain level of detail and smoothness."
