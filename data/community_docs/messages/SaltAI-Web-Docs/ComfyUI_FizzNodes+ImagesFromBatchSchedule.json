        "question": "What is the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImagesFromBatchSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a batch of images based on a predefined schedule by selecting and exporting images from an input image batch according to specified scheduling criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node served as the inspiration for the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The ImagesFromBatchSchedule node was inspired by and extends the capabilities of the ComfyUI-Image-Selector node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'images' input in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node is crucial for defining the source images for the scheduling operation. It is the input image batch from which images are selected and processed according to the batch schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' input represent in ImagesFromBatchSchedule?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input in ImagesFromBatchSchedule represents the scheduling criteria or instructions provided as text, which dictate how images are selected and organized from the input image batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'current_frame' input in the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input specifies the current frame in the scheduling sequence and is used by the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node to determine which images are selected from the input image batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'max_frames' input affect the operation of the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' input in ImagesFromBatchSchedule defines the maximum number of frames to consider in the scheduling process, setting the upper limit of the batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the ImagesFromBatchSchedule node output a batch of images or just a single image?",
        "answer": "The ImagesFromBatchSchedule node outputs a single image or a batch of images that have been selected and processed according to the input batch schedule. The collection of images is ready for further use or analysis."
