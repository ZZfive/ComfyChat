        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltOPAC node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltOPAC node in ComfyUI is designed for orchestrating Perlin noise sampling configurations to enhance dynamic visual effects in synchronization with audio or other triggers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the categories that SaltOPAC node belongs to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltOPAC node belongs to the 'SALT/Scheduling' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the use of a semi-random keyframe generation in SaltOPAC?",
        "answer": "The 'use_wiggle' parameter, which is a BOOLEAN type, controls the use of semi-random keyframe generation in SaltOPAC."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of 'frame_count' in the SaltOPAC node?",
        "answer": "The default value of 'frame_count' in the SaltOPAC node is 48."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SaltOPAC determine the range of zoom during the frame generation process?",
        "answer": "SaltOPAC determines the range of zoom based on the 'zoom_range' parameter, which is a STRING type and defaults to '0.95,1.05', and the variations are controlled by 'zoom_tremor_scale', a FLOAT type parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used for generating semi-random keyframes based on Perlin noise?",
        "answer": "SaltOPAC is the node in ComfyUI used for generating semi-random keyframes for zoom, spin, and translation based on specified start and end ranges using Perlin noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'translation_x_schdule_list' output of SaltOPAC node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'translation_x_schdule_list' output of the SaltOPAC node represents the scheduled list of semi-random X-axis translation values based on Perlin noise, which are generated for the frames specified by 'frame_count'."
