        "question": "What is Boolean To Float [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Boolean To Float [Dream] is a custom node in ComfyUI that converts a boolean input into a float output, allowing for custom float values to be assigned to true and false boolean states."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Boolean To Float [Dream] node facilitate?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float [Dream] node facilitates conditional logic and value transformation in data flows, enabling dynamic adjustments based on boolean conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Boolean To Float [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float [Dream] node requires inputs of type 'boolean', 'on_true' (a float value for true conditions), and 'on_false' (a float value for false conditions)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Boolean To Float [Dream] node determine its output?",
        "answer": "The Boolean To Float [Dream] node outputs a float value based on the boolean input: it returns 'on_true' if the boolean is true, and 'on_false' if the boolean is false."
