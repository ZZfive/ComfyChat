        "question": "What is ImageNoiseBinomial?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to apply binomial noise to images, offering control over monochromaticity, inversion, and channel-specific adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageNoiseBinomial belong to?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial belongs to the category image/noise in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageNoiseBinomial do to images?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial applies binomial noise to images, simulating stochastic variations based on binomial distribution parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseBinomial manipulate image data?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial manipulates image data by adding stochastic variations that mimic the effects of binomial distribution-based noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does ImageNoiseBinomial require?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial requires parameters such as 'images' (input images), 'n' (number of trials), 'p' (success probability), 'monochromatic' (uniform noise application), 'invert' (noise inversion), and 'channels' (targeted channels for noise application)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseBinomial handle monochromatic noise?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial handles monochromatic noise by applying uniform noise across all channels if specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ImageNoiseBinomial produce?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBinomial produces image outputs with binomial noise applied, reflecting the specified noise parameters."
