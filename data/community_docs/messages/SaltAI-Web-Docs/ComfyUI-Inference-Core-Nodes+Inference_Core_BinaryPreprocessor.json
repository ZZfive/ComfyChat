        "question": "What is the category of Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor falls under the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node do?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node preprocesses images by converting them to binary format based on a threshold value, specifically extracting lines or edges from images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The required input for Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor is the `image`, which is the input image to be processed using binary thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the bin_threshold input used in the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `bin_threshold` input is used to specify the threshold value for binary conversion of images, which classifies pixel values as black or white for line or edge extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `resolution` input play in the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` input determines the resolution to which the input image is resized before applying the binary thresholding, influencing the detail level of the extracted lines or edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of image is output by the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node outputs a processed image in binary format, where significant lines or edges are highlighted by converting the image based on the specified binary threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function and return type of the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The function of the Inference_Core_BinaryPreprocessor node is `execute`, and it returns a processed image in binary format with the data type `IMAGE`."
