        "question": "What is the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioTrebleBoost node in ComfyUI is used to enhance the treble frequencies of an audio input, allowing for a customizable increase in higher frequency ranges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input parameters required by the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioTrebleBoost node requires three input parameters: `audio`, the raw audio data to be processed; `cutoff_freq`, specifying the frequency threshold for treble boost; and `boost_dB`, controlling the level of gain applied to the treble frequencies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'cutoff_freq' parameter in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff_freq' parameter in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node specifies the frequency threshold above which treble frequencies will be boosted, defining the range of frequencies affected by the treble boost."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is SaltAudioTrebleBoost in the context of ComfyUI's node system?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioTrebleBoost is an audio effect node in ComfyUI, belonging to the 'SALT/Audio/Effect' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'boost_dB' parameter control in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost_dB' parameter in the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node controls the level of gain applied to the treble frequencies above the specified cutoff point, directly influencing the intensity of the treble enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node is the modified audio with enhanced treble frequencies, reflecting the applied gain adjustments and high-pass filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python functions does the SaltAudioTrebleBoost node utilize to implement its functionality?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioTrebleBoost node utilizes the `high_pass_filter` and `apply_gain` functions from the `AudioSegment` class to increase the treble frequencies, and `overlay` to combine the original and boosted audio streams."
