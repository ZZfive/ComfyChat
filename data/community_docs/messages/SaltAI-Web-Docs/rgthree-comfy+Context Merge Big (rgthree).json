        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context Merge Big node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big node is designed to merge multiple context objects into a single, comprehensive context within ComfyUI, ensuring a seamless integration of context data while allowing later contexts to override earlier ones where overlaps occur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Context Merge Big node output?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big node outputs a variety of data types including `CONTEXT`, `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, `LATENT`, `IMAGE`, `SEED`, `STEPS`, `STEP_REFINER`, `CFG`, `CKPT_NAME`, `SAMPLER`, `SCHEDULER`, `CLIP_WIDTH`, `CLIP_HEIGHT`, `TEXT_POS_G`, `TEXT_POS_L`, `TEXT_NEG_G`, `TEXT_NEG_L`, `MASK`, and `CONTROL_NET`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Merge Big node handle multiple input contexts?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big node intelligently merges multiple input contexts, with later contexts overriding earlier ones in case of overlaps, to create a unified context output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the Context Merge Big node?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big node has an infrastructure requirement of `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Context Merge Big node handle a large number of input contexts?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Context Merge Big node is designed to handle multiple input contexts (`ctx_i`) and merge them into a single comprehensive context, with potential inputs including `ctx_01`, `ctx_02`, `ctx_03`, `ctx_04`, and `ctx_05`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Context Merge Big node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Context Merge Big node is `RgthreeContextMergeBig`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context Merge Big node process its inputs in terms of order?",
        "answer": "The Context Merge Big node processes its inputs in an ordered manner, with later contexts (`ctx_i`) taking precedence over earlier ones during the merging process."
