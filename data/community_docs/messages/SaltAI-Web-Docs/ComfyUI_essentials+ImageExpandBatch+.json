        "question": "What is the ImageExpandBatch+ node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageExpandBatch+ node is designed to expand the batch size of images, allowing for the inclusion of additional images into an existing batch, which is crucial for batch processing operations such as image transformations, augmentations, or processing in machine learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the ImageExpandBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter represents the input image or images to be expanded into a larger batch, and it is crucial for defining the set of images that will undergo batch expansion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters are required for the ImageExpandBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The required parameters for the ImageExpandBatch+ node are 'image', 'size', and 'method'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageExpandBatch+ node handle the replication of existing images?",
        "answer": "The ImageExpandBatch+ node can replicate existing images based on the 'size' and 'method' parameters. It can either expand by replicating all images evenly, repeating the first image to fill in the extra slots, or repeating the last image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'size' parameter specify in the ImageExpandBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter specifies the desired size of the expanded batch, determining how many times the input images are replicated or how additional images are included."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'method' parameter do in the ImageExpandBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter defines the technique used for expanding the batch in the ImageExpandBatch+ node, such as replication of existing images or inclusion of new images, affecting the approach to batch expansion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the ImageExpandBatch+ node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImageExpandBatch+ node produces an output of type 'image', which represents the expanded batch of images, ready for further processing or analysis."
