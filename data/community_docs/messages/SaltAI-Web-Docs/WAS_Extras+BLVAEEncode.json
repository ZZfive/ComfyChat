        "question": "What is the BLVAEEncode node primarily used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BLVAEEncode node is designed for encoding images into a latent space representation using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two encoding modes supported by BLVAEEncode?",
        "answer": "BLVAEEncode supports both standard and tiled encoding modes for handling images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter of BLVAEEncode is crucial for determining the characteristics of the latent representation?",
        "answer": "The `vae` parameter is crucial for determining the characteristics of the latent representation by specifying the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `store_or_load_latent` flag do in BLVAEEncode?",
        "answer": "The `store_or_load_latent` flag in BLVAEEncode determines whether the encoded latent representation should be stored or loaded, facilitating persistence of latent data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does BLVAEEncode's output type represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of BLVAEEncode, `latent`, represents the encoded latent representation of the input image, essential for subsequent manipulation or analysis in latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter enables BLVAEEncode to process large images by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces?",
        "answer": "The `tiled` flag in BLVAEEncode, when set to True, enables the node to process large images in a tiled manner, by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "In BLVAEEncode, what is the purpose of the `remove_latent_on_load` flag?",
        "answer": "The `remove_latent_on_load` flag in BLVAEEncode indicates whether the latent representation should be removed from storage upon loading, which can help manage storage space efficiently."
