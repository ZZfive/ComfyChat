        "question": "What is the SeargeFloatMath class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SeargeFloatMath is a class in ComfyUI that provides mathematical operations on floating-point numbers, allowing the execution of basic arithmetic operations with customizable operands and operation types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFloatMath node requires 'op' to specify the arithmetic operation, 'a' as the first operand, 'b' as the second operand for multiplication and division, and 'c' as an additional operand for addition or subtraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used for the input operands 'a', 'b', and 'c'?",
        "answer": "The input operands 'a', 'b', and 'c' use the Comfy data type FLOAT and the Python data type float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SeargeFloatMath node is 'result', representing the result of the specified arithmetic operation on the input operands, with both Comfy and Python data types as FLOAT and float respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operations can be selected by the 'op' input in the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in the SeargeFloatMath node allows for the selection of operations such as 'a * b + c', 'a + c', 'a - c', 'a * b', and 'a / b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'get_value' function of the SeargeFloatMath class responsible for?",
        "answer": "The 'get_value' function of the SeargeFloatMath class is responsible for calculating the result of the selected arithmetic operation based on the provided operands and returning the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'INFRASTRUCTURE' type of the SeargeFloatMath node?",
        "answer": "The 'INFRASTRUCTURE' type of the SeargeFloatMath node is 'CPU', meaning that all calculations are performed on the computer's CPU."
