        "question": "What is the Filter Z (mtb) node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Filter Z (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used for applying depth-based filtering to an image, allowing for selective visibility based on depth values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of operation can the MTB_FilterZ node perform on specified depth regions?",
        "answer": "The MTB_FilterZ node can convert specified depth regions to black or adjust their transparency, with options for thresholding and inversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input of Filter Z (mtb) represent?",
        "answer": "The `image` input of Filter Z (mtb) represents the input image to be filtered based on depth values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the depth map used in the Filter Z (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The depth map in the Filter Z (mtb) node is used to determine which parts of the input image are affected by the filtering process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `to_black` parameter in Filter Z (mtb) do?",
        "answer": "The `to_black` parameter in Filter Z (mtb) is a boolean flag that determines whether the filtered areas are turned to black or made transparent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `threshold` in Filter Z (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` in Filter Z (mtb) is a float value that sets the depth threshold for filtering, controlling which parts of the image are affected based on their depth values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `invert` parameter in the Filter Z (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `invert` parameter in the Filter Z (mtb) node is a boolean flag that inverts the filtering effect, changing which parts of the image are affected based on the threshold."
