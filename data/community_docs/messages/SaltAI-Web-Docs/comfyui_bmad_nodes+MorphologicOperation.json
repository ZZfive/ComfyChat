        "question": "What is the MorphologicOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "MorphologicOperation is a custom node in ComfyUI's Bmad/CV/Morphology category designed to perform various morphological operations on images, such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, top hat, and bottom hat transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MorphologicOperation node include 'src' (the source image), 'operation' (the specific morphological operation), 'kernel_type' (the shape of the kernel), 'kernel_size_x' (the horizontal size of the kernel), 'kernel_size_y' (the vertical size of the kernel), and 'iterations' (the number of times the operation is applied)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operation does the 'operation' parameter in MorphologicOperation control?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' parameter in MorphologicOperation determines the specific morphological operation to be applied to the source image, such as erosion, dilation, or others."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MorphologicOperation node apply morphological operations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MorphologicOperation node applies morphological operations by taking the source image, the selected operation, kernel type, kernel sizes, and number of iterations as inputs, and outputs the image after applying the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MorphologicOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MorphologicOperation node is 'image', which is the output image after the morphological operations have been applied, and it is of type `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is recommended for using the MorphologicOperation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The recommended infra type for using the MorphologicOperation node in ComfyUI is 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for 'kernel_size_x' and 'kernel_size_y' in the MorphologicOperation node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for 'kernel_size_x' and 'kernel_size_y' in the MorphologicOperation node is `INT`, which indicates that these inputs must be integers."
