        "question": "What is the SAM Image Mask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAM Image Mask node in ComfyUI is used to apply the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to an input image, generating a mask based on specified points and labels. It produces both a modified image and a corresponding mask after segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the SAM model play in the SAM Image Mask node?",
        "answer": "The SAM model in the SAM Image Mask node is used for image segmentation. It is crucial in determining the accuracy and quality of the segmentation output, as it uses provided points and labels to identify and segment relevant parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the node `sam_parameters` require for the SAM Image Mask to function correctly?",
        "answer": "The `sam_parameters` input in the SAM Image Mask node requires a dictionary containing parameters such as points and labels for the SAM model to use during segmentation. These parameters guide the model in identifying segments within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type does the SAM Image Mask node require to process the image to be segmented?",
        "answer": "The SAM Image Mask node requires an `image` input type. This input is the image to be segmented. It is processed and modified by the SAM model based on the provided `sam_parameters`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SAM Image Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAM Image Mask node outputs two types: IMAGE and MASK. The `IMAGE` output is the modified image after applying the SAM model and segmentation process, while the `MASK` output is the generated mask corresponding to the segmented parts of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are considered common nodes used in conjunction with the SAM Image Mask?",
        "answer": "The SAM Image Mask node documentation does not specify any common nodes used in conjunction with it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the device type that the SAM model is initially moved to in the SAM Image Mask node's source code?",
        "answer": "In the SAM Image Mask node's source code, the SAM model is initially moved to the device specified by the `device` variable, which defaults to CUDA if available, otherwise, it defaults to CPU."
