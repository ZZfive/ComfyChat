        "question": "What does the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskEdgeDetection node in ComfyUI applies edge detection algorithms to mask regions, enhancing the edges within the masks using methods like Canny or Sobel. It's designed to highlight the contours and boundaries of objects within the mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node include masks (`MASK` dtype), method (`COMBO[STRING]` dtype), low_threshold (`INT` dtype), high_threshold (`INT` dtype), and sobel_ksize (`INT` dtype)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'masks' input affect the output of the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input on which edge detection is performed significantly impacts the output of the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node by delineating object boundaries more clearly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What methods can be chosen for edge detection in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node, and how do they differ?",
        "answer": "The edge detection methods that can be chosen in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node are 'canny' or 'sobel'. The choice of method affects the edge enhancement technique, influencing the clarity and style of the resulting edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'low_threshold' input used in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' input in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node helps in filtering out noise and less prominent edges by setting the lower bound for the edge detection algorithm's thresholding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What defines the most prominent edges in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node's edge enhancement?",
        "answer": "The 'high_threshold' input in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node defines the intensity above which edges are considered significant, ensuring that only the most prominent edges are enhanced."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does changing the 'sobel_ksize' input affect edge detection when using the Sobel method in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node?",
        "answer": "Changing the 'sobel_ksize' input affects the smoothness and precision of edge detection when using the Sobel method in the SaltMaskEdgeDetection node, as it determines the kernel size for the Sobel operator."
