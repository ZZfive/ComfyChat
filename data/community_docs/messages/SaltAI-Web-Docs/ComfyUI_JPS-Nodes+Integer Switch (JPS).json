        "question": "What is the purpose of the Integer Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Integer Switch (JPS) node is designed to select and output one of several integer inputs based on a specified selection criterion, facilitating conditional logic within data flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'select' input of the Integer Switch node determine the output integer value?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input determines which integer input from 'int_1' to 'int_5' to select and output based on the integer value provided, enabling conditional logic and dynamic data flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Integer Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Integer Switch node is 'INT' with the name 'int_out', indicating the output integer value selected based on the input criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for the functionality of the Integer Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Integer_Switch` class is responsible for the functionality of the Integer Switch node in ComfyUI, specifically for the logic that selects between multiple integer inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function `get_int` used for in the Integer Switch node?",
        "answer": "The `get_int` function in the Integer Switch node is used to determine which optional integer input to output based on the 'select' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select' input parameter in the Integer Switch node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input parameter in the Integer Switch node represents the criterion used to determine which optional integer input ('int_1' to 'int_5') to output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of optional integer inputs the Integer Switch node can handle?",
        "answer": "The Integer Switch node can handle up to five optional integer inputs ('int_1' to 'int_5'), each of which can be selected for output based on the 'select' input criterion."
