        "question": "What is the CR Batch Process Switch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Batch Process Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively process images or image batches based on a specified input type, facilitating dynamic handling of either single images or batches of images in image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the execution path of the CR Batch Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The execution path of the CR Batch Process Switch node is determined by the 'Input' parameter, which specifies whether a single image or a batch of images is to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional inputs of the CR Batch Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input is 'Input' which determines the type of processing. The optional inputs are 'image' for processing a single image and 'image_batch' for processing a batch of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Batch Process Switch node output?",
        "answer": "The CR Batch Process Switch node outputs the processed image or image batch depending on the input type selected, along with a URL providing additional help and documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Batch Process Switch node handle processing when 'Input' is set to 'image'?",
        "answer": "When 'Input' is set to 'image', the CR Batch Process Switch node processes the single image provided as 'image' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Batch Process Switch node output when 'Input' is set to 'image batch'?",
        "answer": "When 'Input' is set to 'image batch', the CR Batch Process Switch node outputs the processed batch of images provided as 'image_batch' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can you find additional help and documentation for the CR Batch Process Switch node?",
        "answer": "Additional help and documentation for the CR Batch Process Switch node can be found at the URL provided in the 'show_help' output, specifically at https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/Process-Nodes#cr-batch-process-switch."
