        "question": "What is LatentInterpolate?",
        "answer": "LatentInterpolate is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for interpolating between two sets of latent samples based on a specified ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for LatentInterpolate?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentInterpolate include 'samples1' and 'samples2', both of type LATENT, and 'ratio', a floating-point value that determines the blend between the two sets."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentInterpolate determine the output?",
        "answer": "LatentInterpolate determines the output by creating a new set of latent samples that blend characteristics from 'samples1' and 'samples2' based on the specified 'ratio'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for LatentInterpolate?",
        "answer": "LatentInterpolate is optimized for GPU usage. It commonly works with nodes like KSampler (Efficient) and Latent Noise Injection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of LatentInterpolate?",
        "answer": "LatentInterpolate belongs to the 'latent/advanced' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can LatentInterpolate handle different ratios?",
        "answer": "Yes, LatentInterpolate can handle ratios ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 produces a copy of 'samples1' and 1 produces a copy of 'samples2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code snippet for LatentInterpolate?",
        "answer": "The source code snippet for LatentInterpolate defines a class method 'INPUT_TYPES' and a function 'op' that performs the interpolation based on the input 'samples1', 'samples2', and 'ratio'."
