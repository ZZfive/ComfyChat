        "question": "What is ImageNoiseBeta?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBeta is a custom node in ComfyUI that introduces beta distribution-based noise to images, allowing for various noise effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageNoiseBeta do?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBeta applies beta distribution-based noise to input images. It can adjust noise intensity, apply noise selectively based on color channels, and support both monochromatic and colored noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageNoiseBeta?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageNoiseBeta include 'images', 'a', 'b', 'monochromatic', 'invert', and 'channels'. 'images' are the input images to apply noise, 'a' and 'b' are parameters for the beta distribution, 'monochromatic' specifies whether noise should be applied uniformly across channels, 'invert' controls the visual effect of noise, and 'channels' selects the color channels for noise application."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseBeta modify images?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBeta modifies images by adding or subtracting beta distribution-based noise depending on the 'invert' parameter. It adjusts noise intensity using parameters 'a' and 'b' and can selectively apply noise across different color channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for 'a' in ImageNoiseBeta?",
        "answer": "'a' in ImageNoiseBeta has a Python dtype of 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for 'channels' in ImageNoiseBeta?",
        "answer": "'channels' in ImageNoiseBeta has a Comfy dtype of 'COMBO[STRING]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ImageNoiseBeta affect image output?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBeta affects image output by applying beta distribution-based noise, which can alter the visual appearance of the input images based on the selected noise intensity, color channels, and inversion settings."
