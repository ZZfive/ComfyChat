        "question": "What is the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSmoothRegion node is used to apply a smoothing filter to regions within masks, enhancing the visual quality by reducing noise and irregularities with a specified sigma value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' parameter represent in the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' parameter represents the input masks on which the smoothing operation is to be performed, serving as the primary data for the node's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the degree of smoothing controlled in SaltMaskSmoothRegion?",
        "answer": "The degree of smoothing in SaltMaskSmoothRegion is controlled by the 'sigma' parameter, which specifies the level of smoothness for the filter applied to the mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node output and in what format?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSmoothRegion node outputs a tensor of masks, designated as 'MASKS', that have been smoothed according to the specified sigma value, represented in `torch.Tensor` format in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type associated with the masks input in SaltMaskSmoothRegion?",
        "answer": "The Python data type associated with the masks input in SaltMaskSmoothRegion is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in SaltMaskSmoothRegion adjusts the smoothness level of the filter?",
        "answer": "The 'sigma' parameter in SaltMaskSmoothRegion adjusts the smoothness level of the filter applied to the mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltMaskSmoothRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSmoothRegion node falls under the category 'SALT/Masking/Filter' in ComfyUI."
