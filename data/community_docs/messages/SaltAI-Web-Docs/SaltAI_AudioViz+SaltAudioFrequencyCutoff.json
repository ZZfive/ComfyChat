        "question": "What is the SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff is a custom node in ComfyUI that applies a frequency cutoff to an audio file, using FFmpeg to filter out frequencies above or below a specified cutoff point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff belong to?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff belongs to the 'SALT/Audio/Effect' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node requires 'audio' data, 'filter_type' which specifies the type of filter to apply (lowpass or highpass), and 'cutoff_frequency', the threshold for filtering frequencies."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node process the audio data?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node processes the audio data by applying a frequency cutoff filter using FFmpeg. It either attenuates frequencies above or below the cutoff frequency, depending on the filter type selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'cutoff_frequency' input in SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'cutoff_frequency' input in SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff is an integer (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node provide?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff node outputs the modified audio data after applying the frequency cutoff. The output type is 'audio' and its dtype is 'AUDIO'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What range can the 'cutoff_frequency' in SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff be set?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff_frequency' in SaltAudioFrequencyCutoff can be set within the range from 20 to 20000 ( inclusively ), with a default value of 1000."
