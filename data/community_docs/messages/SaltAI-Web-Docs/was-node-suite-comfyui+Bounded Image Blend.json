        "question": "What is the purpose of the Bounded Image Blend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Bounded Image Blend node in ComfyUI is designed to blend two images within specified bounds, allowing for precise control over the blending process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'target' input represent in the Bounded Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'target' input in the Bounded Image Blend node represents the base image onto which the source image will be blended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'target_bounds' in the Bounded Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'target_bounds' input specifies the bounds within which the source image will be blended onto the target image, allowing for localized blending."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'source' input influence the output of the Bounded Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'source' input is the image that will be blended onto the target, overlaying it within the specified bounds defined by 'target_bounds'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'blend_factor' have in the Bounded Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'blend_factor' determines the intensity of the source image's influence in the blend, with higher values resulting in the source image being more prominent in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'feathering' input in the Bounded Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The 'feathering' input applies a smoothing effect to the edges of the blended area, creating a more seamless transition between the source and target images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Bounded Image Blend node produce?",
        "answer": "The Bounded Image Blend node produces an output of type 'IMAGE', which is the result of blending the source image onto the target within the specified bounds, incorporating blend factor and feathering effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does Bounded Image Blend belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Bounded Image Blend belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Bound' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is Bounded Image Blend an input or output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Bounded Image Blend is classified as an output node in ComfyUI, with the value of 'False' for this classification."
