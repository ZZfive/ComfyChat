    {
        "question": "What is the input type required for the depth map generation using `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor`?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the depth map generation using `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` is an `image`, which serves as the primary data for depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'a' parameter affect the MiDaS depth map generated by `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor`?",
        "answer": "The 'a' parameter in `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` adjusts the depth estimation sensitivity, influencing how the depth map perceives distance and depth."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters are optional inputs for the `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` node?",
        "answer": "The `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` node accepts 'a', 'bg_threshold', and 'resolution' as optional parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the `MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor` node is an image representing the depth map, where pixel intensity corresponds to the estimated depth from the camera perspective."
