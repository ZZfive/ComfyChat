        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configurations based on a predefined schedule, enhancing model performance or behavior for animation or image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node include mode, model, clip, current_frame, schedule_alias, default_lora, strength_model, and strength_clip."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what operational mode can the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node operate without loading any LoRAs?",
        "answer": "The CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node can operate in 'Off' mode without loading any LoRAs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Load default LoRA' mode in CR Load Scheduled LoRAs signify?",
        "answer": "In 'Load default LoRA' mode, the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node specifies a default LoRA to be used when no specific LoRA is scheduled for the current frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'schedule' input in CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule' input in the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node is used when the node is in a mode that requires dynamic LoRA loading based on frame numbers. It details which LoRA to load at specific frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which components are output by the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node?",
        "answer": "The CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node outputs the model and clip after potentially being modified by the application of a LoRA based on its operational mode and schedule, and a show_help URL."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node handle the case when no LoRA is specified for a particular frame in the schedule?",
        "answer": "When no LoRA is specified for a particular frame in the schedule, the CR Load Scheduled LoRAs node uses the default LoRA if available, ensuring that some LoRA is applied to the model, unless in 'Off' mode."
