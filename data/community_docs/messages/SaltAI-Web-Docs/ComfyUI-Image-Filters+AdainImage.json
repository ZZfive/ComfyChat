        "question": "What does the AdainImage node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AdainImage node applies Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) technique to a batch of images, using a reference image to adjust the style of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the primary subjects for the style transfer process in the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The primary subjects for the style transfer process in the AdainImage node are the input images to be stylized."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node allows for blending between the original and stylized images based on the intensity of the style transfer?",
        "answer": "AdainImage node allows for blending between the original and stylized images based on the intensity of the style transfer controlled by the 'factor' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'reference' input in the AdainImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'reference' input in the AdainImage node is used to derive style characteristics (mean and standard deviation) for the style transfer process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of normalization technique does the AdainImage node use?",
        "answer": "The AdainImage node uses Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the source code of the AdainImage node define?",
        "answer": "The source code of the AdainImage node mainly defines the `AdainImage` class which contains the initialization method and the `batch_normalize` method that applies AdaIN to a batch of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of input does the AdainImage node require?",
        "answer": "The AdainImage node requires an 'images' input of dtype `IMAGE` for the input images to be stylized, a 'reference' input of dtype `IMAGE` for the reference image, and a 'factor' input of dtype `FLOAT` to control the intensity of the style transfer."
