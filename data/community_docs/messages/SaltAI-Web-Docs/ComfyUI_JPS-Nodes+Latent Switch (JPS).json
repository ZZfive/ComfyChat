        "question": "What does the Latent Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to select and output one of several provided latent representations based on a given selection index, facilitating dynamic switching between different latent inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the Latent Switch (JPS) node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node can be found in the 'JPS Nodes/Switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type is required by the Latent Switch (JPS) node and what does it do?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node requires an 'select' input of type INT, which determines which latent representation to output based on its numerical index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the Latent Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI accepts optional input types 'latent_i' from latent_1 to latent_5, which are latent representation options that can be selected for output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the Latent Switch (JPS) node provide and how is it defined?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node provides a 'latent_out' output type, which is the selected latent representation based on the input selection index. This output is of type LATENT in Comfy dtype and dict in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used to facilitate dynamic switching between different latent inputs in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Switch (JPS) node can be used in ComfyUI to facilitate dynamic switching between different latent inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select' input parameter of the Latent Switch (JPS) node drive in the generative models?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input parameter of the Latent Switch (JPS) node drives the core functionality of the node by choosing among the available latent inputs, enabling flexible manipulation of latent spaces in generative models."
