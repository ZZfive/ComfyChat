        "question": "What is the SAMModelLoader node for?",
        "answer": "The SAMModelLoader node is designed to load and prepare SAM (Segment Anything Model) models for use in image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SAMModelLoader handle the retrieval of SAM models?",
        "answer": "SAMModelLoader handles the retrieval and initialization of various SAM models, ensuring they are ready for segmentation operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model_name' parameter do in SAMModelLoader?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' parameter specifies the name of the SAM model to be loaded, which is crucial for determining which specific model is retrieved and initialized for segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does SAMModelLoader output?",
        "answer": "SAMModelLoader outputs 'sam_model', which is the loaded and initialized SAM model, ready for segmentation tasks, and its data type is 'SAM_MODEL'."
