        "question": "What is the purpose of the Ratio Advanced node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Ratio Advanced node is designed to provide advanced functionalities for managing and selecting image ratios, allowing for flexible image dimension specifications based on user input or predefined standards."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type specifies whether to use a custom width and height for the latent space in the Ratio Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The input type that specifies whether to use a custom width and height for the latent space is `custom_latent_w` and `custom_latent_h` respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `swap_axis` option do in the Ratio Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The `swap_axis` option in the Ratio Advanced node determines whether the width and height of the selected ratio should be swapped, enabling orientation changes without altering the ratio itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Ratio Advanced node, how can dimensions be adjusted to fit within a specified size constraint?",
        "answer": "Dimensions can be adjusted to fit within a specified size constraint by using the `cte_fit_size` input in the Ratio Advanced node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `target_h` input in the Ratio Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The `target_h` input in the Ratio Advanced node specifies a custom height for the target image, allowing for detailed control over its dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output type indicates the width of the constant tensor extension after processing by the Ratio Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The output type that indicates the width of the constant tensor extension after processing by the Ratio Advanced node is `cte_w`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What functionality is provided by the `use_preset_seed` option in the Ratio Advanced node?",
        "answer": "The `use_preset_seed` option in the Ratio Advanced node determines whether a preset seed should be used for generating images, ensuring consistency in image generation."
