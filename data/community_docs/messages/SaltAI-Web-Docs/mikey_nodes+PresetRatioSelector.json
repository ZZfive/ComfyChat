        "question": "What is the purpose of the PresetRatioSelector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PresetRatioSelector node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and apply predefined and user-defined ratio presets for image dimensions, providing a flexible way to select and apply specific aspect ratios for image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PresetRatioSelector node determine image dimensions?",
        "answer": "The PresetRatioSelector node determines image dimensions by dynamically reading, merging, and deduplicating ratio presets from both a default set and user-customized configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the PresetRatioSelector node use to select ratio presets?",
        "answer": "The PresetRatioSelector node uses the 'select_preset' input to determine which predefined or user-defined ratio preset to select for image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in the PresetRatioSelector node controls orientation adjustment?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_axis' input type in PresetRatioSelector node controls whether the width and height dimensions of selected ratios should be swapped, allowing for easy adjustment of orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of 'use_preset_seed' input in the PresetRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "'use_preset_seed' input in the PresetRatioSelector node indicates whether to use a preset seed for selecting a ratio preset, enabling deterministic selection of presets based on a seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the target width and height dimensions for image generation in the PresetRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The target width and height dimensions for image generation in the PresetRatioSelector node are determined by the selected preset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'latent_w' output in the PresetRatioSelector node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'latent_w' output in the PresetRatioSelector node is 'INT', both in ComfyUI and Python, representing the width dimension of the latent space determined by the selected preset."
