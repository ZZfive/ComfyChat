        "question": "What is the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node in ComfyUI is used for processing three input texts and, based on a condition, outputs either two of the original texts or duplicates one across both outputs, enabling dynamic text manipulation and conditional output generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What condition determines whether 'text_c' is used as the output for both 'text_a' and 'text_b' in the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node?",
        "answer": "In the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node, the condition is determined by the boolean flag 'use_text_c_for_both'. If this flag is set to 'true', 'text_c' will be used as the output for both 'text_a' and 'text_b'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node outputs the text 'Text C' when the condition is met in ComfyUI's Mikey category?",
        "answer": "The 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node under the 'Mikey/Text' category in ComfyUI outputs 'Text C' to both 'text_a' and 'text_b' when the condition set by 'use_text_c_for_both' is met."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' handle the 'text_c' input when 'use_text_c_for_both' is set to 'false'?",
        "answer": "When 'use_text_c_for_both' is set to 'false' in the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node, 'text_c' does not affect the output. Instead, the original 'text_a' and 'text_b' are outputted as they are after potential modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the node that allows for conditional output of text inputs in ComfyUI's Mikey category?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that allows for conditional output of text inputs under the Mikey category in ComfyUI is 'Text2InputOr3rdOption'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'use_text_c_for_both' input of the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'use_text_c_for_both' input of the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node represents a boolean flag that determines whether 'text_c' should be used as the output for both 'text_a' and 'text_b' when the condition is met, allowing for conditional output behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required for the 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node to operate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Text2InputOr3rdOption' node in ComfyUI requires the infrastructure type 'CPU' to operate effectively."
