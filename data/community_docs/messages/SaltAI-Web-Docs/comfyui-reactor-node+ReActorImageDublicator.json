        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorImageDublicator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator node is designed to create duplicates of images, potentially in a list format, as part of the ReActor suite. This functionality is essential for operations that require multiple instances of the same image for processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the ReActorImageDublicator class?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator class requires 'image' and 'count' as inputs. 'image' specifies the original image to be duplicated, and 'count' determines the number of duplicates to be created from the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input specify for the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input specifies the original image to be duplicated, with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'count' input affect the ReActorImageDublicator node's operation?",
        "answer": "The 'count' input determines the number of duplicates to be created from the original image, with a Comfy dtype of 'INT' and a Python dtype of 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ReActorImageDublicator node return after processing?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator node returns a list of duplicated images based on the specified count, with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'List[torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is supported by the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator node supports the 'CPU' infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node status of the ReActorImageDublicator node?",
        "answer": "The ReActorImageDublicator node is not an output node (False)."
