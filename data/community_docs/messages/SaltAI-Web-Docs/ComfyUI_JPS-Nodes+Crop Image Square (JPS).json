        "question": "What is the purpose of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image Square (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to crop an image into a square shape based on specified parameters such as crop position, offsets, zoom level, interpolation method, target resolution, and sharpening intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node is crucial for defining the source image to be cropped?",
        "answer": "The crucial input parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node that defines the source image to be cropped is `image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `zoom` parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node control?",
        "answer": "The `zoom` parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node determines the zoom level applied to the image before cropping, allowing for closer focus on specific areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which interpolation method can be used in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The interpolation methods that can be used in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node include `lanczos`, `nearest`, `bilinear`, `bicubic`, `area`, and `nearest-exact`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `sharpening` parameter influence the output of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `sharpening` parameter in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node influences the output by specifying the intensity of sharpening applied to the cropped image, thus enhancing its details and edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of offsets can be set in the Crop Image Square (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Crop Image Square (JPS) node allows for setting horizontal offset (`offset_x`) and vertical offset (`offset_y`) from the specified crop position, enabling fine-tuning of the crop's starting point on both x and y-axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node and what format is it in?",
        "answer": "The output of the Crop Image Square (JPS) node is the resulting image after the cropping process, which is adjusted to meet the specified square shape, resolution, and quality enhancements. The output format is Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `PIL.Image.Image`."
