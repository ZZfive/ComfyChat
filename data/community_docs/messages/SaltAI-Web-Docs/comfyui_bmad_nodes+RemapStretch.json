        "question": "What is the RemapStretch node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The RemapStretch node in ComfyUI is used to apply a stretching transformation to images, adjusting their geometry based on specified power factors along the x and y axes, centered around a given point."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RemapStretch node include 'power_x', 'power_y', 'center_x', and 'center_y', which are all floats specifying the power factors for stretching and the center point of the stretch effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'power_x' input in the RemapStretch node control?",
        "answer": "The 'power_x' input in the RemapStretch node controls the power factor for stretching along the x-axis, where a higher value results in more pronounced stretching."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemapStretch node is 'remap', which is a set of parameters or a transformation map that defines how the image should be stretched according to the input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the center point inputs in the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the center point inputs ('center_x' and 'center_y') in the RemapStretch node is 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the RemapStretch node inherit from in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapStretch node in ComfyUI inherits from the 'RemapBase' class."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for the RemapStretch node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for the RemapStretch node is 'CPU'."
