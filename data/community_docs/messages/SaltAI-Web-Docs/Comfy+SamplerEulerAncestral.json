        "question": "What category does SamplerEulerAncestral belong to?",
        "answer": "SamplerEulerAncestral belongs to the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/samplers'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SamplerEulerAncestral?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SamplerEulerAncestral are 'eta' and 's_noise'. 'eta' specifies the step size for the Euler method, and 's_noise' determines the scale of noise added at each step."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of SamplerEulerAncestral?",
        "answer": "The output type of SamplerEulerAncestral is a sampler configured for Euler Ancestral sampling, which is represented as 'SAMPLER'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SamplerEulerAncestral generate samples?",
        "answer": "SamplerEulerAncestral generates samples using the Euler Ancestral sampling method. It utilizes the 'eta' parameter for step size and 's_noise' parameter for adding noise, adjusting the variability of the samples accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of SamplerEulerAncestral?",
        "answer": "The function of SamplerEulerAncestral is to provide a sampler configured for Euler Ancestral sampling through the method 'get_sampler', which takes parameters 'eta' and 's_noise'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for SamplerEulerAncestral?",
        "answer": "SamplerEulerAncestral is suitable for CPU infrastructures. Specific details about common nodes are currently unknown."
