        "question": "What is the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to scale the dimensions of an image by a specified factor, effectively multiplying the width and height of the image to produce new dimensions. It is useful for adjusting image resolution for processing or display at different sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' input in the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node represents the original width of the image, which is then scaled by the factor input to calculate the new width of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is responsible for adjusting image resolution in ComfyUI's JPS Nodes/Math category?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply (JPS) node is responsible for adjusting image resolution in ComfyUI's JPS Nodes/Math category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node require and what types are they?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply (JPS) node requires 'width' and 'height' inputs, both of type INT with values between 256 and 8192, and a 'factor' of type INT ranging from 1 to 8, all with a step of 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node calculate the new dimensions of an image?",
        "answer": "The Resolution Multiply (JPS) node calculates the new dimensions of an image by multiplying the original width and height by the specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node include 'width_resized' and 'height_resized', both of type INT, representing the new width and height of the image after scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Resolution Multiply (JPS) node is CPU."
