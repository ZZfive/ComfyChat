        "question": "What is the purpose of the Canny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Canny node in ComfyUI is designed for edge detection in images, utilizing the Canny algorithm to identify and highlight edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of image processing does the Canny node perform?",
        "answer": "The Canny node performs edge detection, enhancing the structural details of the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The Canny node requires inputs such as 'image', 'low_threshold', and 'high_threshold' to perform edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'low_threshold' parameter affect edge detection?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' parameter in the Canny node determines the minimum intensity gradient considered for an edge, affecting the sensitivity of edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'high_threshold' parameter control in the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The 'high_threshold' parameter in the Canny node sets the maximum intensity gradient considered for an edge, influencing the selectivity of edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Canny node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Canny node is an image with highlighted edges, where edges are detected using the Canny algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with the Canny node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes used with the Canny node include ControlNetApply and PreviewImage."
