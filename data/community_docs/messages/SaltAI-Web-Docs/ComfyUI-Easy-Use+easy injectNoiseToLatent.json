        "question": "What is easy injectNoiseToLatent?",
        "answer": "easy injectNoiseToLatent is a class in ComfyUI designed for injecting noise into latent representations, allowing for varied outputs from a given input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does easy injectNoiseToLatent belong to?",
        "answer": "easy injectNoiseToLatent belongs to the EasyUse/Latent category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the injectNoiseToLatent node modify?",
        "answer": "The injectNoiseToLatent node modifies latent representations by injecting noise, which can alter the output generated from a given input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for injectNoiseToLatent?",
        "answer": "The required input types for injectNoiseToLatent are strength (FLOAT), normalize (BOOLEAN), and average (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does normalize affect the noised latent?",
        "answer": "normalize determines whether the noised latent should be normalized, impacting the distribution of the resulting latent values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of mask in injectNoiseToLatent?",
        "answer": "mask is an optional input that selectively applies noise to parts of the latent space, allowing for localized modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mix_randn_amount parameter control?",
        "answer": "mix_randn_amount controls the amount of random noise mixed into the noised latent, introducing additional randomness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of injectNoiseToLatent?",
        "answer": "The output type of injectNoiseToLatent is LATENT, representing the modified latent representation after noise injection."
