        "question": "What is the `easy seed` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy seed` node in ComfyUI is designed to manage and control the seed value used in generation processes, allowing for the replication of results or the introduction of variability by setting, incrementing, decrementing, or randomizing the seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the `easy seed` node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy seed` node belongs to the `EasyUse/Seed` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of setting a fixed seed in the `easy seed` node?",
        "answer": "Setting a fixed seed in the `easy seed` node is used to ensure reproducibility and consistency in generation processes by specifying a consistent starting point for any pseudo-random operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the seed is incremented or decremented in the `easy seed` node?",
        "answer": "When the seed is incremented or decremented in the `easy seed` node, it introduces variability by changing the starting point for pseudo-random operations while still controlling the sequence of results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type is required for the `easy seed` node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the `easy seed` node is `seed`, which specifies the initial seed value serving as the basis for generation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the `seed` input in the `easy seed` node?",
        "answer": "The data type used for the `seed` input in the `easy seed` node is `INT`, which corresponds to the integer type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the `easy seed` node randomize the seed for each node or globally?",
        "answer": "Yes, the `easy seed` node can randomize the seed for each node or globally across the workflow, which is useful for introducing variability in generation processes."
