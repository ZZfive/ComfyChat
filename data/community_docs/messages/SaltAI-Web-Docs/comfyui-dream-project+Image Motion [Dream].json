        "question": "What is Image Motion [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Image Motion [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI that applies transformations to an image to simulate motion, including zooming, translating in both x and y directions, and applying overlap masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for Image Motion [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The required input types for Image Motion [Dream] include 'image' (IMAGE), 'zoom' (FLOAT), 'mask_i_feather' (INT), 'mask_i_overlap' (INT), 'x_translation' (FLOAT), 'y_translation' (FLOAT), and 'frame_counter' (FRAME_COUNTER)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Image Motion [Dream] simulate lateral motion?",
        "answer": "Image Motion [Dream] simulates lateral motion using the 'x_translation' parameter, which controls horizontal movement of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can enhance realism in Image Motion [Dream]?",
        "answer": "An optional 'noise' image can be used to add noise to the motion effect in Image Motion [Dream], enhancing realism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of Image Motion [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The output types of Image Motion [Dream] include 'image' (IMAGE), 'mask1' (MASK), 'mask2' (MASK), and 'mask3' (MASK)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Image Motion [Dream] handle the transformation process?",
        "answer": "Image Motion [Dream] handles transformations by resizing the image based on the 'zoom' parameter, applying translations with 'x_translation' and 'y_translation', and using overlap masks for complex motion effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frame_counter' in Image Motion [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_counter' in Image Motion [Dream] tracks the number of frames processed, which is useful for animations or effects that change over time."
