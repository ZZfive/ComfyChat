        "question": "What is the purpose of the TextCombinations node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a variety of text combinations based on predefined text inputs and operations, allowing for dynamic mixing and matching of text elements to create new composite strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the 'use_seed' input in the TextCombinations node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'use_seed' input in the TextCombinations node determines whether a seed should be used to generate deterministic combinations of text inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for customizing the output format in the TextCombinations node?",
        "answer": "The 'delimiter' input in the TextCombinations node is responsible for customizing the output format by specifying a string used to separate text elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output1' and 'output2' represent in the context of the TextCombinations node?",
        "answer": "In the context of the TextCombinations node, 'output1' and 'output2' represent the resulting strings after applying the specified combination operation to the input texts, with each output type being of the 'STRING' dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'seed' input utilized in the TextCombinations node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input in the TextCombinations node, an integer value, is used to ensure deterministic output when combining text inputs if the 'use_seed' input is set to 'true'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the method of mixing and matching text inputs in the TextCombinations node?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' input in the TextCombinations node defines the specific combination operation to be applied to the text inputs, determining how they are mixed and matched to generate the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of input texts that the TextCombinations node can process?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations node can process 'STRING' dtype inputs, specifically 'text1' and 'text2', which can be dynamically combined according to the 'operation' defined, and 'delimiter' for formatting output."
