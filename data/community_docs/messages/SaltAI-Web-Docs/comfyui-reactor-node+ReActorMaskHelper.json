        "question": "What is the ReActor Masking Helper node designed for?",
        "answer": "The ReActor Masking Helper node is designed to assist in the process of masking within the ReActor framework, involving operations such as combining, dilating, and refining masks for use in face swapping or restoration tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ReActor Mask Helper node belong to?",
        "answer": "The ReActor Mask Helper node belongs to the category `ðŸŒŒ ReActor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is considered the primary input for mask-related operations in the ReActorMaskHelper node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is the primary input for mask-related operations in the ReActorMaskHelper node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `swapped_image` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node?",
        "answer": "The `swapped_image` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node represents the image resulting from a face swap operation, which may require further masking or adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `mask_hint_threshold` input affect the process of mask generation in the ReActorMaskHelper node?",
        "answer": "The `mask_hint_threshold` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node is used to generate mask hints, controlling the threshold for pre-identification of mask areas in the process of mask generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `morphology_operation` input do in the ReActorMaskHelper node?",
        "answer": "The `morphology_operation` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node specifies the type of morphological operation to apply to the mask, affecting its shape and boundaries such as dilation or erosion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `blur_radius` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node handle?",
        "answer": "The `blur_radius` input in the ReActorMaskHelper node deals with the `INT` data type, representing the radius for blurring the mask to soften edges or blend it more seamlessly with the image."
