        "question": "What is CM_NearestSDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution is a class in ComfyUI that finds the nearest supported SDXL resolution to an input image's resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_NearestSDXLResolution belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution belongs to the 'math/graphics' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of CM_NearestSDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution is designed to determine the closest SDXL resolution to the aspect ratio of a given input image, ensuring optimal resizing without significant distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_NearestSDXLResolution calculate the nearest resolution?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution calculates the aspect ratio of the input image and compares it with a list of supported SDXL resolutions. It selects the resolution with the smallest difference in aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CM_NearestSDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution requires an input image, which is of Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CM_NearestSDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_NearestSDXLResolution outputs the width and height components of the nearest SDXL resolution. These are of Comfy dtype 'INT' and Python dtype 'int'."
    },
