        "question": "What is the Image Edge Detection Filter node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Edge Detection Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to apply edge detection filters to images, enhancing the visual distinction of shapes and boundaries within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Image Edge Detection Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Image Edge Detection Filter node requires `image` as the input image to apply edge detection on, and `mode` to specify the edge detection mode to use, either 'normal' or 'laplacian'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kinds of edge detection modes does the Image Edge Detection Filter node support?",
        "answer": "The Image Edge Detection Filter node supports 'normal' edge detection mode, which is typically a simple edge detection algorithm, and 'laplacian' mode, which applies a more complex edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Edge Detection Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Edge Detection Filter node is `image`, which is the output image with edges detected and enhanced, represented as a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Edge Detection Filter node process the `image` input?",
        "answer": "The Image Edge Detection Filter node processes the `image` input by applying the selected edge detection mode, either 'normal' which applies the FIND_EDGES filter, or 'laplacian' which applies a specific Kernel filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the `mode` input to the Image Edge Detection Filter node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the `mode` input to the Image Edge Detection Filter node is `str`, and it specifies the mode as either 'normal' or 'laplacian'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the Image Edge Detection Filter node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Edge Detection Filter node is classified under the 'WAS Suite/Image/Filter' category in ComfyUI."
