        "question": "What is the `CR Model List` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `CR Model List` node is designed to manage and organize models within a list structure, facilitating the selection and application of different models in a dynamic and flexible manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the `CR Model List` node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `CR Model List` node belongs to the `ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/ðŸŽ¥ Animation/ðŸ’€ Legacy` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `ckpt_name` inputs in the `CR Model List` node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` inputs (such as `ckpt_name1`, `ckpt_name2`, etc.) are used to specify the names of checkpoints, which play a crucial role in defining the models to be included in the model list."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do aliases contribute to the functionality of the `CR Model List` node?",
        "answer": "Aliases (such as `alias1`, `alias2`, etc.) provided for each checkpoint help in easier identification and management of models within the list, enhancing their accessibility and comprehensibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines if the inputs `ckpt_name1` to `ckpt_name5` are included in the model list?",
        "answer": "Each checkpoint name input, from `ckpt_name1` to `ckpt_name5`, is only included in the model list if its associated value is not set to `None`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `model_list` input in the `CR Model List` node?",
        "answer": "The `model_list` input allows users to input a pre-existing list of models to be managed within the node, which is crucial for integrating additional models and directly affects the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `CR Model List` node output, and what is its dtype?",
        "answer": "The `CR Model List` node outputs a `MODEL_LIST` which is a list of models currently managed within the node, and a `STRING` with textual information related to operations performed on the models, with dtypes `List[str]` and `str`, respectively."
