        "question": "What does the SaltAudioBassBoost node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioBassBoost node enhances the bass frequencies of an audio input, applying a low-pass filter and gain increase to boost the lower end of the audio spectrum."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Audio Bass Boost node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Audio Bass Boost node is `SaltAudioBassBoost`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category would you find the SaltAudioBassBoost node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You would find the SaltAudioBassBoost node in the `SALT/Audio/Effect` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which data types are compatible with the 'audio' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node accepts data of type `AUDIO` in Comfy dtype and `bytes` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'cutoff_freq' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'cutoff_freq' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node serves as the threshold for the low-pass filter, determining the frequency below which the audio will be boosted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of the 'cutoff_freq' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The range of the 'cutoff_freq' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node is from 20 to 300, with a step of 1, and a default value of 150."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'boost_dB' input have on audio processing in the SaltAudioBassBoost node?",
        "answer": "The 'boost_dB' input in the SaltAudioBassBoost node specifies the amount of gain to be applied to the frequencies below the cutoff frequency, measured in decibels."
