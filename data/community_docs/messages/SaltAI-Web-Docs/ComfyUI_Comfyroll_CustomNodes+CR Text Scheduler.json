    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Text Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Text Scheduler node include 'mode', 'current_frame', 'schedule_alias', 'default_text', and 'schedule_format'. These inputs specify the scheduling mode, current frame number, schedule identifier, default text, and schedule format respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input specify in the CR Text Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the CR Text Scheduler node specifies the scheduling mode, which can be either 'Default Text' to use a predefined text or 'Schedule' to apply a predefined schedule, determining how text outputs are managed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'current_frame' input utilized by the CR Text Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input in the CR Text Scheduler node indicates the current frame number, which is used to determine the appropriate text output based on the schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenarios would the 'default_text' input be used in the CR Text Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'default_text' input in the CR Text Scheduler node is used to provide a default text that will be used when no specific schedule is applied, serving as a fallback text output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule_format' input do in the CR Text Scheduler node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_format' input in the CR Text Scheduler node defines the format of the schedule, either 'CR' or 'Deforum', which affects how the schedule is interpreted by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Text Scheduler node output?",
        "answer": "The CR Text Scheduler node outputs the scheduled text for the current frame and a show_help URL providing additional information or assistance related to text scheduling."
