        "question": "What is the SALVTON_Apply node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SALVTON_Apply node in ComfyUI is designed to apply the SAL-VTON (Virtual Try-On) process, enabling the overlay of a garment onto a person's image realistically considering the shape and fit of the garment relative to the person's body."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific types of images does the SALVTON_Apply node require as input?",
        "answer": "The SALVTON_Apply node requires three specific types of images as input: the 'garment' image, 'person' image, and 'garment_mask' image, all in the format of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'garment' input in the SALVTON_Apply node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'garment' input in the SALVTON_Apply node represents the garment image to be overlaid onto the person's image, playing a crucial role in the virtual try-on process by providing the specific item of clothing to be fitted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the garment's position and fit determined in the virtual try-on process?",
        "answer": "The garment's position and fit are determined by the 'person' image onto which the garment will be applied, this image serves as the base for the virtual try-on and defines how the garment will be positioned and fitted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'garment_mask' in the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The 'garment_mask' is used by the SALVTON_Apply node to accurately overlay the garment onto the person's image by defining the garment's boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the virtual try-on process using the SALVTON_Apply node?",
        "answer": "The output of the virtual try-on process using the SALVTON_Apply node is an image showcasing the person with the garment realistically fitted onto them, in the format of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what type of infrastructure does the SALVTON_Apply node optimally run its processes?",
        "answer": "The SALVTON_Apply node optimally runs its processes on GPU infrastructure, as indicated by the 'Infra type' 'GPU' specified in the node's documentation."
