        "question": "What is CM_Vec3ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ScalarOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs scalar operations on 3-dimensional vectors, allowing for mathematical manipulations such as scaling and division."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec3ScalarOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ScalarOperation belongs to the 'math/vec3' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CM_Vec3ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ScalarOperation requires inputs such as 'op', which specifies the scalar operation, 'a', which is a 3-dimensional vector, and 'b', which is a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input do in CM_Vec3ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec3ScalarOperation specifies the scalar operation to be performed on the vector, influencing its magnitude or direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec3ScalarOperation handle the 'a' input?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3ScalarOperation handles the 'a' input as the 3-dimensional vector to be operated on, serving as the primary operand for the scalar operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of value does 'b' represent in CM_Vec3ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "'b' in CM_Vec3ScalarOperation represents the scalar value used in the operation, affecting the vector's magnitude or direction based on the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_Vec3ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_Vec3ScalarOperation is a 3-dimensional vector ('vec3'), reflecting changes in magnitude or direction after applying the specified scalar operation."
