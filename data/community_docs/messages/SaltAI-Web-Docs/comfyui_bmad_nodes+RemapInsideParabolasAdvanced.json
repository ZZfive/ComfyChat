        "question": "What is the class name of the node that specializes in remapping images based on the geometry of two parabolas?",
        "answer": "The class name is `RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node fall under in Bmad/CV/Transform?",
        "answer": "RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced falls under the `Bmad/CV/Transform` category, which is typically associated with image transformation nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `dst_mask_with_i_parabolas` input represent in the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `dst_mask_with_i_parabolas` input represents the destination mask containing two parabolas used to guide the remapping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What purpose does the `curve_wise_adjust` input serve in the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `curve_wise_adjust` input allows for adjustments to the remapping intensity along the curve of the parabolas, providing finer control over the curvature effect in the remapped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `ortho_wise_adjust` input modify the behavior of the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `ortho_wise_adjust` input adjusts the remapping intensity orthogonally to the curve of the parabolas, enabling control over the spread of the remapping effect perpendicular to the parabolas' curvature."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the `flip_ortho` input have on the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `flip_ortho` input determines whether the orthogonal adjustment direction should be flipped, adding an additional layer of customization to the remapping effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `RemapInsideParabolasAdvanced` node is `REMAP`, which represents a remapped image based on the specified parabolas and adjustments, reflecting changes in pixel locations as dictated by the input parameters."
