        "question": "What is LatentCrop in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "LatentCrop is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for cropping operations on latent representations of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LatentCrop node do?",
        "answer": "The LatentCrop node performs cropping operations on latent representations of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The LatentCrop node requires inputs such as 'samples' (latent representations), 'width', 'height', 'x' (starting x-coordinate), and 'y' (starting y-coordinate)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentCrop affect the latent representation?",
        "answer": "LatentCrop modifies the latent representation by cropping it based on specified dimensions (width and height) and coordinates (x and y)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentCrop node is a modified latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The LatentCrop node is intended for use with GPU infrastructure and operates on latent representations to perform cropping. Specific dimensions and coordinates should be carefully set to achieve desired cropping results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The LatentCrop node belongs to the category 'latent/transform' within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the LatentCrop node?",
        "answer": "The function of the LatentCrop node is to crop latent representations of images."
