        "question": "What is the SaltListOperation node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltListOperation node is designed for performing numeric operations on a schedule list, allowing for dynamic adjustments to scheduled values based on predefined operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the specific operation to be applied to the schedule lists in SaltListOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' parameter determines the specific numeric operation to be applied to the schedule lists, with options including 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', among others."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SaltListOperation handle different data types for output?",
        "answer": "The output data type of SaltListOperation can be customized with the 'output_type' parameter, which can be set to 'default', 'int', 'float', or 'boolean'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'schedule_list_a' parameter in SaltListOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_list_a' parameter in SaltListOperation represents the primary numeric list to be operated on, serving as one of the inputs for the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can SaltListOperation handle operations requiring two lists?",
        "answer": "SaltListOperation can handle operations requiring two lists by using the 'schedule_list_b' parameter, which serves as the secondary numeric list involved in operations such as 'add' or 'subtract'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the 'expression' parameter serve in SaltListOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'expression' parameter in SaltListOperation allows for the input of a custom mathematical expression to be applied to the schedule lists, offering advanced flexibility in list manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the SaltListOperation node?",
        "answer": "The SaltListOperation node outputs a 'schedule_list', which is the modified sequence of values resulting from applying the specified operation to the input schedule lists."
