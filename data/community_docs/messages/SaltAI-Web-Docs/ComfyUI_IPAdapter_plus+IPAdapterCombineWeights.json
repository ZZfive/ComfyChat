        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterCombineWeights node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterCombineWeights node is designed to aggregate and combine weight values from two different sources, providing a unified set of weights and their count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the IPAdapterCombineWeights node?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterCombineWeights node requires 'weights_i' as input, which is of unknown Python dtype but recognized as 'FLOAT' dtype in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weights' output of IPAdapterCombineWeights represent?",
        "answer": "The 'weights' output represents the combined list of weights resulting from merging weights_1 and weights_2, reflecting the aggregate influence of both inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is output by the 'count' field in IPAdapterCombineWeights?",
        "answer": "The 'count' output is an integer (Python dtype: 'int') representing the total number of weights in the combined list."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IPAdapterCombineWeights handle single value inputs for weights?",
        "answer": "If weights_1 or weights_2 is not a list, the IPAdapterCombineWeights node will convert it into a list before merging."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the IPAdapterCombineWeights node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterCombineWeights node is categorized under 'ipadapter/utils' in ComfyUI."
