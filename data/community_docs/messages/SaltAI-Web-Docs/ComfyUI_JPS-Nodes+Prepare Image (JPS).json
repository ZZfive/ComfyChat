        "question": "What is the Prepare Image (JPS) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Prepare Image (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed for processing and adjusting images according to specified parameters such as resizing, cropping, padding, and applying transformations like interpolation and sharpening."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Prepare Image node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Prepare Image node is `Prepare Image (JPS)`. It belongs to the `JPS Nodes/Image` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Prepare Image node determines the final width of the image after processing?",
        "answer": "The `target_w` parameter in the Prepare Image node determines the final width of the image after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the horizontal offset in the Prepare Image (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `offset_w` input in the Prepare Image (JPS) node controls the horizontal offset applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the interpolation method selected in the Prepare Image (JPS) node characterized in terms of data types?",
        "answer": "In the Prepare Image (JPS) node, the interpolation method is selected using the `interpolation` parameter, which is of dtype `COMBO[STRING]` in Comfy and `str` in Python, allowing for methods like `lanczos`, `nearest`, `bilinear`, `bicubic`, `area`, and `nearest-exact`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sharpening` parameter in the Prepare Image (JPS) node do?",
        "answer": "The `sharpening` parameter in the Prepare Image (JPS) node specifies the level of sharpening to be applied to the output image, enhancing detail and clarity, with a dtype of `FLOAT` in Comfy and `float` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input types control the size and position of the cropping area in the Prepare Image (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_w_percent` and `crop_h_percent` input types control the percentage of the image's width and height to be retained after cropping, allowing for precise control over the dimensions of the cropped area in the Prepare Image (JPS) node."
