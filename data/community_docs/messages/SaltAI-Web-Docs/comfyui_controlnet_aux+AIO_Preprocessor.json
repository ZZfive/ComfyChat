        "question": "What is the AIO_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The AIO_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically select and apply a specified auxiliary preprocessing operation on an image, based on the preprocessor type chosen, supporting a variety of preprocessing options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of input does AIO_Preprocessor require?",
        "answer": "AIO_Preprocessor requires the input of an `image` and optionally a `preprocessor` and `resolution`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `image` input used in the AIO_Preprocessor?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in AIO_Preprocessor is the input image to be preprocessed. This image is directly passed to the selected auxiliary preprocessor for modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `preprocessor` input in the AIO_Preprocessor?",
        "answer": "The `preprocessor` input in AIO_Preprocessor specifies the type of preprocessing to apply to the image. This selection determines which auxiliary preprocessor's logic will be executed, impacting the final preprocessing outcome on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `resolution` input in the AIO_Preprocessor correspond to?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` input in AIO_Preprocessor corresponds to the resolution for the preprocessing operation, which may be used by certain preprocessors to adjust the processing detail level or output resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the AIO_Preprocessor output?",
        "answer": "The AIO_Preprocessor outputs the preprocessed image, as modified by the selected auxiliary preprocessor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does AIO_Preprocessor belong to?",
        "answer": "AIO_Preprocessor belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors' category."
