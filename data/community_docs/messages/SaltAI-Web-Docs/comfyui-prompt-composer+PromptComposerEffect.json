        "question": "What is the purpose of the PromptComposerEffect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerEffect node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a specified effect with a given weight to an input text, enhancing the prompt composition process by allowing for dynamic customization based on the effect's intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the nature of the modification in the PromptComposerEffect node?",
        "answer": "The nature of the modification in the PromptComposerEffect node is determined by the `effect` parameter, which specifies the effect to be applied to the input text."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the PromptComposerEffect node defines the intensity of the applied effect?",
        "answer": "The parameter that defines the intensity of the applied effect in the PromptComposerEffect node is `effect_weight`, which allows for fine-tuned control over the modification's impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the application of the effect be dynamically enabled or disabled in the PromptComposerEffect node?",
        "answer": "The application of the effect can be dynamically enabled or disabled in the PromptComposerEffect node by using the `active` parameter, a boolean that activates or deactivates the effect application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is the `text_in_opt` in the PromptComposerEffect node?",
        "answer": "The `text_in_opt` input in the PromptComposerEffect node is an optional input that serves as the base text for further modification by the specified effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the PromptComposerEffect node belong?",
        "answer": "The PromptComposerEffect node belongs to the 'AI WizArt/Prompt Composer Tools/Deprecated' category."
