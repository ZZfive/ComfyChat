        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToModelList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToModelList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple model-related inputs into a single list, which is essential for operations that require handling a collection of models simultaneously, such as batch processing or model comparison tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ToModelList node belong to?",
        "answer": "The ToModelList node belongs to the category `Bmad/Lists/Make or Intercalate` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the size of the resulting list when using ToModelList?",
        "answer": "The size of the resulting list when using ToModelList is determined by the parameter `inputs_len`, which specifies the number of model inputs to be aggregated into the list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does `inputs_len` in ToModelList use?",
        "answer": "`inputs_len` in ToModelList uses the data type `INT` in Comfy's dtype and `int` in Python's dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ToModelList node and how is it represented in Python?",
        "answer": "The output of the ToModelList node is a list containing the aggregated model inputs, represented as `List[torch.nn.Module]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of device does the ToModelList node typically run on?",
        "answer": "The ToModelList node typically runs on the CPU, as indicated by its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ToModelList node an output node or does it have an output node dependency?",
        "answer": "The ToModelList node is not an output node; it has no output node dependency."
