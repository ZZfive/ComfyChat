        "question": "What is GMFSS Fortuna VFI?",
        "answer": "GMFSS Fortuna VFI is a frame interpolation node in ComfyUI designed to generate intermediate frames between two given images using a deep learning model to enhance video fluidity and realism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for specifying the pre-trained model used by GMFSS Fortuna VFI?",
        "answer": "The required input for specifying the pre-trained model in GMFSS Fortuna VFI is the `ckpt_name`, which is the checkpoint name for the model to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used to hold the sequence of frames for frame interpolation in GMFSS Fortuna VFI?",
        "answer": "The input that holds the sequence of frames for frame interpolation in GMFSS Fortuna VFI is `frames`, which is a tensor containing the frames as IMAGE type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the CUDA cache cleared to prevent memory overflow during processing in GMFSS Fortuna VFI?",
        "answer": "To prevent memory overflow during processing in GMFSS Fortuna VFI, the CUDA cache is cleared after every `clear_cache_after_n_frames`, an integer input that specifies how often the cache should be cleared."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter controls the number of intermediate frames generated by GMFSS Fortuna VFI?",
        "answer": "The parameter that controls the number of intermediate frames generated by GMFSS Fortuna VFI is `multiplier`, an integer input that indicates how many intermediate frames to generate between each pair of input frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input in GMFSS Fortuna VFI that allows for selective frame interpolation?",
        "answer": "The optional input in GMFSS Fortuna VFI that allows for selective frame interpolation is `optional_interpolation_states`, which provides state information to control which frames are interpolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output generated by the GMFSS Fortuna VFI node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output generated by the GMFSS Fortuna VFI node is IMAGE, which is a tensor containing the interpolated frames outputted as a torch.Tensor in Python."
