    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `intensity_threshold` input in the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `intensity_threshold` input in the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node determines the threshold for intensity differentiation, aiding in the distinction of lineart from the background by setting a cutoff intensity value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dtype is used by the image input in the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The image input in the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node uses the `IMAGE` dtype by Comfy and the `torch.Tensor` dtype by Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_LineartStandardPreprocessor node is an image with enhanced lineart features, ready for further processing or analysis."
