        "question": "What is the ImageSelector node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node in ComfyUI is designed to filter and select specific images from a given set based on user-defined indexes, supporting individual or range selections for customized image processing and manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageSelector node specify the images to be selected?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node specifies the images to be selected using the `selected_indexes` parameter, which supports individual indexes and ranges for flexible image selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node has two required inputs: the `images` parameter, which represents the set of images to select from (dtype: `IMAGE` in Comfy terms, `torch.Tensor` in Python); and the `selected_indexes` parameter, specifying the indexes of images to select (dtype: `STRING` in Comfy terms, `str` in Python)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node outputs the filtered set of images, selected according to the specified indexes. The output dtype is `IMAGE` in Comfy terms, corresponding to `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes is ImageSelector commonly used alongside in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSelector node in ComfyUI is commonly used alongside Reroute nodes for image processing and manipulation workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can ImageSelector handle image ranges as well as individual image selections?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ImageSelector node can handle both individual image selections and ranges of images, making it versatile for various image processing needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the ImageSelector node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the ImageSelector node is `GPU`, indicating that it can utilize GPU resources for enhanced image processing capabilities."
