        "question": "What is CR Index Multiply?",
        "answer": "CR Index Multiply is a custom node in ComfyUI from the category 'Comfyroll Studio/Utils/Index', designed to multiply a given index by a specified factor, dynamically adjusting indices within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'index' input in CR Index Multiply?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'index' input in CR Index Multiply is 'INT' in both Comfy and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CR Index Multiply alter the flow of subsequent operations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Index Multiply alters the flow of subsequent operations by potentially changing the index value, thus affecting how data is manipulated or accessed in the workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter is crucial for determining the base value of the index that will be adjusted by multiplication in CR Index Multiply?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter is crucial for determining the base value of the index that will be adjusted by multiplication in CR Index Multiply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' parameter define in CR Index Multiply?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' parameter defines how much the index will be scaled in CR Index Multiply, playing a key role in the calculation and the resulting modified index value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the node CR Index Multiply output, other than the modified index?",
        "answer": "Apart from the modified index, CR Index Multiply also outputs the factor used in the multiplication, returned unchanged, and a URL 'show_help' providing additional documentation related to the index multiplication operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used in ComfyUI for multiplying an index by a specified factor?",
        "answer": "The node used in ComfyUI for multiplying an index by a specified factor is CR Index Multiply."
