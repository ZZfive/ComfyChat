        "question": "What is the easy imageScaleDownBy node?",
        "answer": "easy imageScaleDownBy is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to scale down images by a specified factor, adjusting the dimensions of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can easy imageScaleDownBy be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "easy imageScaleDownBy can be found under the EasyUse/Image category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy imageScaleDownBy node take input?",
        "answer": "The easy imageScaleDownBy node requires input in the form of images and a scale_by factor. The image input is of type IMAGE, which is a torch.Tensor, and the scale_by input is a FLOAT in Python, specifying how much to scale down the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the scale_by parameter in easy imageScaleDownBy?",
        "answer": "The scale_by parameter in easy imageScaleDownBy determines the factor by which the images will be scaled down. It directly influences the output size of the images, allowing for precise control over the scaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the easy imageScaleDownBy node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the easy imageScaleDownBy node is a torch.Tensor of type IMAGE, representing the scaled-down images with dimensions adjusted according to the specified scale factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used to scale down images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the easy imageScaleDownBy node can be used to scale down images. It scales the images by a specified factor while maintaining their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the type of infrastructure required to run easy imageScaleDownBy?",
        "answer": "easy imageScaleDownBy requires a GPU infra type to run, meaning it is optimized for graphical processing units."
