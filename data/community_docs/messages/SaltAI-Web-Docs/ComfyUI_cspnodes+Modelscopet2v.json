        "question": "What is the purpose of the Modelscope t2v node?",
        "answer": "The Modelscope t2v node is designed for transforming text inputs into visual outputs, leveraging advanced models to interpret and visualize textual descriptions in a visual format."
    },
    {
        "question": "From which category does the Modelscope t2v belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Modelscope t2v belongs to the 'cspnodes/modelscope' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prompt' parameter specify in the Modelscope t2v node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' parameter in the Modelscope t2v node specifies the textual input that describes the desired visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter controls the unwanted characteristics in the generated images of the Modelscope t2v?",
        "answer": "The 'negative_prompt' parameter in the Modelscope t2v node provides textual input that describes undesired aspects of the visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model_path' parameter in the Modelscope t2v node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_path' parameter in the Modelscope t2v node specifies the path to the model used for generating visual content, which allows for the selection of different models offering various styles or capabilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter of Modelscope t2v determines the number of inference steps for generating images?",
        "answer": "The 'num_inference_steps' parameter in the Modelscope t2v determines the number of steps the model will take during the inference process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python and Comfy dtype does the 'seed' parameter have in the Modelscope t2v node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter of Modelscope t2v node has the Comfy dtype of `INT` and Python dtype of `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'guidance_scale' affect the output of the Modelscope t2v node?",
        "answer": "The 'guidance_scale' parameter in the Modelscope t2v node controls the degree to which the model adheres to the prompt, and a higher guidance scale can result in images that more closely match the provided description."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Modelscope t2v node produce?",
        "answer": "The Modelscope t2v node produces an output of type 'IMAGE', which represents the generated visual content based on the textual descriptions provided as input."
