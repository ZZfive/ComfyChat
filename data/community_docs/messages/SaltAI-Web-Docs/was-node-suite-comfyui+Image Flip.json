        "question": "What is the Image Flip node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Image Flip node in ComfyUI is used for flipping images either horizontally or vertically, providing simple yet effective transformations of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Image Flip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Flip node falls under the category 'WAS Suite/Image/Transform' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input is crucial for the Image Flip node to determine which images undergo the flipping process?",
        "answer": "The crucial input for the Image Flip node to determine which images undergo the flipping process is a batch of images to be flipped, represented by the parameter 'images'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Flip node specify the direction of the flip?",
        "answer": "The direction of the flip in the Image Flip node is specified by the 'mode' input, which can be set to either 'horizontal' or 'vertical' to affect how the images are transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the images input in the Image Flip node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the 'images' input in the Image Flip node is 'List[torch.Tensor]', representing a batch of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' input determine in the Image Flip node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the Image Flip node determines the direction of the flip, whether 'horizontal' or 'vertical'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output from the Image Flip node in terms of the images processed?",
        "answer": "The output from the Image Flip node is a batch of images after being flipped according to the specified mode, and the data type is 'torch.Tensor'."
