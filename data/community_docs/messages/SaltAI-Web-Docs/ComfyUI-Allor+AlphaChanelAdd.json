        "question": "What is AlphaChanelAdd?",
        "answer": "AlphaChanelAdd is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to add an alpha channel to images that lack one, ensuring all images in a batch have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the AlphaChanelAdd node do?",
        "answer": "The AlphaChanelAdd node adds an alpha channel to input images that do not already have one. This modification ensures consistency in image data by ensuring all processed images have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of AlphaChanelAdd?",
        "answer": "AlphaChanelAdd belongs to the 'image/alpha' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for AlphaChanelAdd?",
        "answer": "The required input type for AlphaChanelAdd is 'images', which are batches of images that need an alpha channel added. These images are of Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of AlphaChanelAdd?",
        "answer": "The output type of AlphaChanelAdd is 'image', which is a modified version of the input images with an added alpha channel. The output images also have four channels and are of Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does AlphaChanelAdd handle images with existing alpha channels?",
        "answer": "AlphaChanelAdd checks if the input images already have four channels. If they do, it returns the images unchanged. If not, it adds an alpha channel to ensure all images have four channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for AlphaChanelAdd?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for AlphaChanelAdd is GPU."
