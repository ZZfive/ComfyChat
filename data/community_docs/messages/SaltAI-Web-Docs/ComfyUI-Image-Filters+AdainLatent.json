        "question": "What is AdainLatent and what does it do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "AdainLatent is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to perform adaptive instance normalization on latent representations, aligning the mean and standard deviation of a target latent space with those of a reference space, modulated by a specified factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AdainLatent node?",
        "answer": "The AdainLatent node requires three inputs: 'latents', 'reference', and 'factor'. 'latents' is the target latent representations to be normalized, 'reference' provides the style characteristics to be transferred, and 'factor' controls the extent of style application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latex' input represent in the AdainLatent node?",
        "answer": "There is no 'latex' input in the AdainLatent node. The correct input is 'latents', which represents the target latent representations to be normalized."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type of AdainLatent specifies the style attributes that will be applied to the target latents?",
        "answer": "The 'reference' input type specifies the style attributes that will be applied to the target latents in the AdainLatent node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'factor' input type affect the output of the AdainLatent node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input type controls the extent to which the style characteristics from the reference are applied to the target latents, allowing for fine-tuning the balance between preserving the original content and applying the new style."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the AdainLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AdainLatent node falls under the 'latent/filters' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected output of the AdainLatent node?",
        "answer": "The AdainLatent node outputs a modified latent representation, 'latent', after applying adaptive instance normalization, reflecting the style characteristics of the reference with the original content of the target latents."
