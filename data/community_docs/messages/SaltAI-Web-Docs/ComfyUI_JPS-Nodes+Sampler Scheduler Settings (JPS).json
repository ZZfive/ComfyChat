        "question": "What is the purpose of the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the selection and configuration of samplers and schedulers within a generative pipeline, allowing users to specify and retrieve the settings for various sampling strategies and their corresponding scheduling algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is required for the 'sampler_name' field in the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' field in the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node requires the name of the sampler to be used, playing a crucial role in determining the sampling strategy for the generative process. Its Comfy dtype is COMBO[STRING], and its Python dtype is comfy.samplers.KSampler.SAMPLERS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'scheduler' input in the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node play?",
        "answer": "The 'scheduler' input in the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node determines the scheduling algorithm to be applied, directly affecting the execution and efficiency of the sampling process. Its Comfy dtype is COMBO[STRING], and its Python dtype is comfy.samplers.KSampler.SCHEDULERS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node provide?",
        "answer": "The Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node provides two outputs: 'sampler_name' and 'scheduler'. The 'sampler_name' output returns the name of the selected sampler and has a Python dtype of str. The 'scheduler' output returns the selected scheduling algorithm and also has a Python dtype of str."

    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the function for getting sampler and scheduler settings implemented in the source code of the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The function for getting sampler and scheduler settings, named 'get_samsched', is implemented in the source code of the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node by returning the 'sampler_name' and 'scheduler' parameters passed to it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category that the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node belongs to in the class definition of the node?",
        "answer": "The category that the Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS) node belongs to in the class definition is 'JPS Nodes/Settings'."
