    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'low_threshold' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node specifies the lower bound for the hysteresis thresholding step in the Canny edge detection algorithm, controlling the detection of weak edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'high_threshold' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'high_threshold' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node is 200, which defines the upper bound for the hysteresis thresholding step, determining the detection of strong edges in the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in the Inference_Core_CannyEdgePreprocessor node specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before applying the Canny edge detection algorithm, affecting the detail level of detected edges."
    },
