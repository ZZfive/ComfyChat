        "question": "What is the purpose of the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images for generating normal maps using the BAE (Boundary Aware Encoder) model, which enhances images for further processing or visualization by estimating surface normals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional inputs of the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The required input of the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor is `image`, the input image to be processed for normal map generation. The optional input is `resolution`, the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, affecting the detail level of the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor and how is it represented?",
        "answer": "The output of the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor is the output normal map generated from the input image, providing an estimation of surface normals. It is represented with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor belongs to the category of `ControlNet Preprocessors/Normal and Depth Estimators` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `resolution` parameter in the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` parameter in the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is used to resize the input image before processing, affecting the detail level of the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name used in the source code for the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The class name used in the source code for the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor is `BAE_Normal_Map_Preprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of infrastructure is recommended for running the BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is recommended to run on an infrastructure of type `GPU`."
