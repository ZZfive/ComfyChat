        "question": "What is the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The 'MaskExpandBatch+' node in ComfyUI is designed to process a batch of masks, applying expansion or contraction operations to each mask in the batch, which can dilate (expand) or erode (contract) the masks based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific type of image processing tasks is the MaskExpandBatch node useful for?",
        "answer": "The MaskExpandBatch node is particularly useful in image processing tasks where precise control over mask dimensions is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of parameter is 'size' in the MaskExpandBatch+ node, and how does it affect mask processing?",
        "answer": "The 'size' parameter in the MaskExpandBatch+ node specifies the magnitude of the expansion or contraction with Comfy dtype 'INT', where positive values indicate expansion, and negative values indicate contraction, affecting the size of the masks directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter selects the technique for manipulating masks in the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node determines the technique used for expanding or contracting the masks, offering a choice between different algorithms for mask manipulation, with Comfy dtype 'COMBO[STRING]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node, and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node is 'MASK', representing a batch of masks that have been either expanded or contracted based on the provided parameters, suitable for further image processing applications, with Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are commonly related to the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node?",
        "answer": "Common nodes in ComfyUI related to the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node are unknown, as this information is not provided in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtypes are associated with the input parameters of the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtypes associated with the input parameters of the 'MaskExpandBatch+' node are: 'torch.Tensor' for the 'mask' parameter, 'int' for the 'size' parameter, and 'str' for the 'method' parameter."
