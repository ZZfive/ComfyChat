        "question": "What is the primary function of the Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI initializes a seed value for random number generation, providing a foundation for deterministic outcomes in processes that involve randomness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Seed node output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI outputs the initialized seed value as a SEED, NUMBER, FLOAT, and INT, allowing its use in various contexts requiring different number types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is required for the Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI requires an input of `seed`, which specifies the initial seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of random processes by initializing the random number generator with a known state."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the output from the Seed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI outputs data in the following types: SEED, NUMBER, FLOAT, and INT, with respective Python data types of int, int, float, and int."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the seed value be used in ComfyUI after being initialized by the Seed node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, after the seed value is initialized by the Seed node, it can be used in subsequent random number generation processes by connecting the 'seed' output to nodes that require a seed for deterministic random outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Seed node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed node in ComfyUI belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Number' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Seed node in ComfyUI be used as an input for the KSampler SDXL (Eff.) node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the seed value output from the Seed node in ComfyUI can be used as an input for the KSampler SDXL (Eff.) node to ensure deterministic results in image generation processes that involve randomness."
