        "question": "What is the role of SeargeOutput1 in the context of generative models?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput1 is designed to demultiplex and output various prompt-related parameters and media from a single input structure, serving as a critical node in the pipeline for handling and refining user inputs into actionable data for generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'parameters' input of SeargeOutput1 represent?",
        "answer": "The 'parameters' input is the central data structure from which all output parameters are derived, containing all necessary information about prompts, styles, and media for the node to process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does SeargeOutput1 produce?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput1 outputs a variety of types including 'parameters' (comfy dtype: PARAMETERS, python dtype: Dict[str, Any]), 'main_prompt' (comfy dtype: STRING, python dtype: str), 'secondary_prompt' (comfy dtype: STRING, python dtype: str), 'style_prompt' (comfy dtype: STRING, python dtype: str), 'negative_prompt' (comfy dtype: STRING, python dtype: str), 'negative_style' (comfy dtype: STRING, python dtype: str), 'image' (comfy dtype: IMAGE, python dtype: Any), and 'mask' (comfy dtype: MASK, python dtype: Any)."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is SeargeOutput1 classified?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput1 is classified under the category 'Searge/_deprecated_/UI/Outputs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type is associated with the 'parameters' output of SeargeOutput1?",
        "answer": "The 'parameters' output of SeargeOutput1 has a Python data type of Dict[str, Any]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SeargeOutput1 handle the extraction of textual prompts and associated media?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput1 extracts textual prompts such as 'main_prompt', 'secondary_prompt', 'style_prompt', and 'negative_prompt' and outputs associated media like 'image' and 'mask', all derived from the input 'parameters'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the style-related prompts in SeargeOutput1?",
        "answer": "The style-related prompts in SeargeOutput1, such as 'style_prompt' and 'negative_style', are intended to guide the desired artistic or thematic direction and to counterbalance certain stylistic directions respectively."
