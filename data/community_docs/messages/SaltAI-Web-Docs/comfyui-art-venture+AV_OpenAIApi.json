    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AV_OpenAIApi node are `openai_api_key`, which is the OpenAI API key for authenticating requests, and `endpoint`, which specifies the base address for OpenAI's API calls."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value of the `endpoint` input for the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "The default value of the `endpoint` input for the AV_OpenAIApi node is `https://api.openai.com/v1`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the AV_OpenAIApi node provide in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AV_OpenAIApi node provides an output of type `LLM_API`, which returns an instance configured for interacting with OpenAI's API, encapsulating the necessary details for making language model requests."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `llm_api` output of the AV_OpenAIApi node represent?",
        "answer": "The `llm_api` output of the AV_OpenAIApi node represents an instance configured for interacting with OpenAI's API, encapsulating the necessary details for making language model requests."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the `openai_api_key` input is not provided to the AV_OpenAIApi node?",
        "answer": "If the `openai_api_key` input is not provided to the AV_OpenAIApi node, it will attempt to use the API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If no key is found, an exception will be raised indicating that the OpenAI API key is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for the functionality of the AV_OpenAIApi node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `OpenAIApiNode` class is responsible for the functionality of the AV_OpenAIApi node in ComfyUI, managing the input and output types as well as the creation of the API instance."
