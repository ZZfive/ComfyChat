        "question": "What is the Unary Mask Op node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unary Mask Op node in ComfyUI is used to apply a specified unary operation to a given mask image, transforming it according to the chosen operation such as inverting, averaging, rounding, clamping, or taking the absolute value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Unary Mask Op node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Unary Mask Op node belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Unary Mask Op node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Unary Mask Op node are `image`, representing the mask image to be transformed, and `op`, specifying the unary operation to apply to the mask image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of Unary Mask Op in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node of Unary Mask Op in ComfyUI is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of dtype is used for the 'image' parameter in the Unary Mask Op node?",
        "answer": "For the 'image' parameter in the Unary Mask Op node, the Comfy dtype is `IMAGE` and the Python dtype is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can be specified with the 'op' parameter in the Unary Mask Op node?",
        "answer": "The 'op' parameter in the Unary Mask Op node can specify operations such as 'invert', 'average', 'round', 'clamp', or 'abs'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Unary Mask Op node return after applying the unary operation?",
        "answer": "After applying the unary operation, the Unary Mask Op node returns the transformed mask image, with the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and the Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
