        "question": "What is the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'True Random.org Number Generator' node in ComfyUI is used to interface with the RANDOM.ORG API to generate true random numbers based on atmospheric noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'api_key' input in the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node?",
        "answer": "The 'api_key' input is for accessing RANDOM.ORG's services. It's essential for authentication and utilizing the API to generate random numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of numbers can be output by the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node?",
        "answer": "The 'True Random.org Number Generator' node can output numbers in three types: 'NUMBER', 'FLOAT', and 'INT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node generate random numbers?",
        "answer": "The 'True Random.org Number Generator' node generates random numbers by making a request to the RANDOM.ORG API using the provided 'api_key'. The API then returns random numbers based on atmospheric noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node, and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The 'True Random.org Number Generator' node requires four input types: 'api_key', 'minimum', 'maximum', and 'mode'. 'api_key' is the API key for accessing RANDOM.ORG's services. 'minimum' is the lower bound of the range within which random numbers are generated. 'maximum' is the upper bound of the range. 'mode' determines the mode of number generation, offering flexibility in how randomness is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the rules for the 'minimum' input in the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node?",
        "answer": "The 'minimum' input must be within the range of -18446744073709551615 to 18446744073709551615."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mode' input in the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the 'True Random.org Number Generator' node determines the mode of number generation, offering flexibility in how randomness is applied."
