        "question": "What does the SaltMaskErodeRegion node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node applies an erosion filter to shrink masked areas in images based on a specified number of iterations, effectively refining mask boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required by the SaltMaskErodeRegion node for its operation?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node requires 'masks' (torch.Tensor) as the areas to be eroded and 'iterations' (int) to specify the number of times the erosion operation is to be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'masks' parameter utilized by the SaltMaskErodeRegion node?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' parameter is used to define the areas to be processed and refined by the erosion operation, serving as the input masks to be eroded by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the SaltMaskErodeRegion node in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node is located in the 'SALT/Masking/Filter' category in ComfyUI's node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node is 'MASK' representing torch.Tensor, which signifies the refined masks after applying the erosion filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which characteristic of the SaltMaskErodeRegion node allows it to refine mask boundaries in images?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node is equipped with an erosion filter application, which is designed to refine mask boundaries by eroding the edges of masked regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure does the SaltMaskErodeRegion node prefer for optimal performance?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskErodeRegion node prefers a GPU infrastructure for optimal performance, indicated by its infrastructure type listed as 'GPU'."
