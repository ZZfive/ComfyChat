        "question": "What category does CM_NumberUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_NumberUnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/number' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node setting for CM_NumberUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output node setting for CM_NumberUnaryOperation is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required by CM_NumberUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_NumberUnaryOperation requires 'op' and 'a' inputs. 'op' specifies the unary operation to be performed, and 'a' is the numerical input on which the operation will be performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Comfy dtype is used for 'op' in CM_NumberUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "'op' in CM_NumberUnaryOperation uses the Comfy dtype COMBO[STRING]."

    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is used for 'a' in CM_NumberUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "'a' in CM_NumberUnaryOperation uses the Python dtype number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_NumberUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_NumberUnaryOperation is NUMBER, with Comfy dtype NUMBER and Python dtype float."
