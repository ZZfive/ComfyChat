        "question": "What is the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for extracting stylized line drawings from images using scribble detection and XDoG filtering techniques, making them suitable for further artistic or analytical processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input represent in the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor node represents the input image to be processed for line extraction, serving as the primary data for scribble detection and XDoG filtering techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the threshold input of Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor affect the image processing?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' input of the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor affects the sensitivity of the XDoG filter in detecting edges. A lower threshold value results in finer details being captured, while a higher value emphasizes more prominent edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the resolution input in Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor specifies the resolution at which the image should be processed, affecting the level of detail captured in the extracted lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor in terms of its type and what it represents?",
        "answer": "The output of Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor is an IMAGE type, representing a processed image with stylized line drawings emphasizing edges and details extracted using the Scribble_XDoG technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes work well with the Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The common nodes that work well with Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor in ComfyUI include PreviewImage and CR Multi-ControlNet Stack, facilitating previewing and multi-stack control network applications respectively."
