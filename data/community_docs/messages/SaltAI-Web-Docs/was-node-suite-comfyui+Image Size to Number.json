        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Size to Number node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Size to Number node in ComfyUI is designed to convert the dimensions of an image into numerical values, providing both integer and floating-point representations of the image's width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Image Size to Number node?",
        "answer": "The Image Size to Number node requires an `image` input. This is the input image for which the width and height are to be determined and converted into numerical values, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does Image Size to Number belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Image Size to Number belongs to the `WAS Suite/Number/Operations` category in the ComfyUI node suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types produced by the Image Size to Number node?",
        "answer": "The Image Size to Number node produces the following output types: `width_num` and `height_num` with Comfy dtype `NUMBER` and Python dtype `int`, `width_float` and `height_float` with Comfy dtype `FLOAT` and Python dtype `float`, and `width_int` and `height_int` with Comfy dtype `INT` and Python dtype `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method in the source code of Image Size to Number is responsible for processing the image?",
        "answer": "The method responsible for processing the image in the Image Size to Number node is `image_width_height(self, image)`, where the input `image` is converted to a PIL image to extract its size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Size to Number node return if the image size is not available?",
        "answer": "If the input image does not have a size when processed by the Image Size to Number node, it returns `0` for all width and height outputs, both as integers and as floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the recommended nodes for common operations related to number types in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "For common operations related to number types in ComfyUI, the recommended node is `Number Operation`, which can be found in the WAS Node Suite documentation."
