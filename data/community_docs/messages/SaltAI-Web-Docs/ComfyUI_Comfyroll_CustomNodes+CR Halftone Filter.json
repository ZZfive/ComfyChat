        "question": "What is the CR Halftone Filter node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node in ComfyUI is used to apply a halftone effect to images, simulating the look of classic print media through a pattern of dots."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of images can the CR Halftone Filter node accept as input?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node accepts both PIL Images and PyTorch tensors as input, automatically converting tensors to PIL Images if necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What customization options does the CR Halftone Filter node offer?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node offers customization of dot size, shape, resolution, and control over the halftone effect through color channel separation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Halftone Filter node adjust the halftone effect based on dot size?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node allows adjustment of the dot size in the halftone pattern, providing control over the granularity of the effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the angle parameters in the CR Halftone Filter node?",
        "answer": "The angle parameters in the CR Halftone Filter node allow for precise control over the orientation of the halftone dots in the CMYK color space, adjusting the effect for each color channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CR Halftone Filter node apply antialiasing, and what is its effect?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CR Halftone Filter node can apply antialiasing, which smoothes the edges of the halftone dots for a cleaner appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Halftone Filter node output after applying the filter?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node outputs the image with the applied halftone effect, converted to RGB format, and a URL string providing additional help and documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some of the input parameters that control the halftoning process?",
        "answer": "Input parameters that control the halftoning process include `image`, `dot_size`, `dot_shape`, `resolution`, `angle_c`, `angle_m`, `angle_y`, `angle_k`, `greyscale`, `antialias`, `antialias_scale`, and `border_blending`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the CR Halftone Filter node found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Halftone Filter node is found in the category ðŸ§©Comfyroll Studio/ðŸ‘¾Graphics/ðŸŽ¨Filter in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to non-square angle sampling near the borders when `border_blending` is set to True?",
        "answer": "When `border_blending` is set to True and the angle is not square (i.e., not at 90 degrees), the CR Halftone Filter node uses a weighted average of the neighboring pixels to adjust the sampling near the borders for a smoother transition."
