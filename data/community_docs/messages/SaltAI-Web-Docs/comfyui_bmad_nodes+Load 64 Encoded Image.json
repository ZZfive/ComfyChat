        "question": "What is the Load 64 Encoded Image node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node in ComfyUI is designed to decode and load images from base64-encoded strings, converting them into a tensor format for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Load 64 Encoded Image node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node belongs to the 'Bmad/api' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'image_code' parameter in the Load 64 Encoded Image node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'image_code' parameter in the Load 64 Encoded Image node is used to receive a base64-encoded string representing an image, which is then decoded back into a tensor format for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what format does the Load 64 Encoded Image node output the decoded image?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node outputs the decoded image in a tensor format, which is a 'torch.Tensor' type specifically, encapsulating the image data in a format compatible with deep learning models and other image processing operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Load 64 Encoded Image node facilitate in terms of image data transmission?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node facilitates the handling of images transmitted over networks where binary data needs to be encoded into a string format, making it versatile for various network-based image handling scenarios."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are capable of decoding base64 strings into image tensors for processing?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node in the 'Bmad/api' category is capable of decoding base64 strings into image tensors for further processing in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the process followed by the Load 64 Encoded Image node to decode and load images?",
        "answer": "The Load 64 Encoded Image node decodes base64-encoded image strings using the 'image_code' parameter, opens the decoded image using the 'Image' library, converts it to RGB format, converts it to a numpy array, normalizes it, and finally converts it to a torch.Tensor for output."
