        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Input Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to toggle between two latent inputs based on a boolean condition, allowing for conditional selection of latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Latent Input Switch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Input Switch node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_a' input in the Latent Input Switch node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_a' input in the Latent Input Switch node represents the first latent input to consider for selection, which plays a crucial role in determining the output based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python and Comfy dtypes for the 'boolean' input in the Latent Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean' input in the Latent Input Switch node has a Comfy dtype of `BOOLEAN` and a Python dtype of `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent' output from the Latent Input Switch node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output from the Latent Input Switch node represents the selected latent input based on the boolean condition, facilitating conditional logic in processing latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'latent_b' input in the Latent Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_b' input in the Latent Input Switch node provides an alternative choice for the output, contingent on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Latent Input Switch node return when the boolean condition is True?",
        "answer": "When the boolean condition is True, the Latent Input Switch node returns the 'latent_a' input as the output."
