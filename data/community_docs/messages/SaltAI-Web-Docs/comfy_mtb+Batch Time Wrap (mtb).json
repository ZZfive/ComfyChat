        "question": "What is the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node in ComfyUI designed for?",
        "answer": "The Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to remap a batch of images according to a specified time curve, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the image sequences based on temporal data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI allows for the dynamic adjustment of image batches based on time curve data?",
        "answer": "The Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node allows for the dynamic adjustment of image batches based on time curve data in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, what does the 'target_count' input specify in the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'target_count' input in the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node specifies the desired number of images in the output batch, allowing for the dynamic adjustment of the batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node in terms of image format?",
        "answer": "The output of the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node in terms of image format is a list of images (`List[Image]`) that have been remapped according to the specified time curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'curve' input represent in the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node of ComfyUI, the 'curve' input represents a sequence of floating-point values defining the time curve along which the input images are remapped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional data does the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node output apart from remapped images?",
        "answer": "Apart from remapped images, the Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node outputs a sequence of floating-point values (`List[float]`) representing the interpolated positions of the input images along the time curve."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI's Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node, which data type does the 'image' output use?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI's Batch Time Wrap (mtb) node, the 'image' output uses the `IMAGE` data type."
