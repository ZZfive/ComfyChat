        "question": "What is the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node is designed to merge a batch of latent representations into a single grid layout, allowing for the efficient organization and visualization of multiple latent samples in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the dimensions of the grid layout in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node?",
        "answer": "The dimensions of the grid layout in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node are determined by the number of rows and columns specified as inputs, and an image mask used to fetch the sizes for the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'batch' input accept in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch' input in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node accepts latent representations data, specifically in the form of a dictionary with keys containing torch.Tensor values, as defined by the Comfy dtype 'LATENT' and the Python dtype 'Dict[str, torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'latent' output generated by the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output of the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node is generated by merging multiple individual latent samples into a single composite representation laid out in a grid defined by the number of rows and columns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' input in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node is used to determine the grid dimensions and is essential for fetching the sizes needed to create the grid layout, even though it is not directly used in the merging process of the latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the returned data type of the 'latent' output in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node?",
        "answer": "The returned data type of the 'latent' output in the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node is defined by the Comfy dtype 'LATENT', which is a dictionary containing torch.Tensor values, as specified by the Python dtype 'Dict[str, torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Merge Latent Batch Gridwise node belongs to the 'Bmad/latent' category in ComfyUI."
