        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Load LoRA node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Load LoRA node is designed to dynamically load and apply Learning Rate Annealing (LoRA) adjustments to models and clips based on specified parameters or defaults, enhancing model performance or behavior by adjusting learning rates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CR Load LoRA node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CR Load LoRA node include `model`, `clip`, `switch`, `lora_name`, `strength_model`, and `strength_clip`, covering the model and clip adjustments, the switch for enabling or disabling LoRA adjustments, the name of the LoRA, and the strength of the LoRA adjustments for the model and clip respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which python dtype is used to represent the model input in CR Load LoRA node?",
        "answer": "The model input in CR Load LoRA node is represented by the python dtype `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node in ComfyUI can be used to load a specific LoRA and apply it to a model dynamically?",
        "answer": "The CR Load LoRA node can be used in ComfyUI to load a specific LoRA and apply it to a model dynamically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `switch` input in CR Load LoRA node control?",
        "answer": "The `switch` input in CR Load LoRA node controls whether the LoRA adjustments are enabled or disabled. It allows for conditional application of the adjustments based on specific criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can CR Load LoRA node conditionally load LoRAs based on the presence of LoRA parameters?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CR Load LoRA node can conditionally load LoRAs based on the presence of LoRA parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Load LoRA node handle default LoRAs?",
        "answer": "The CR Load LoRA node handles default LoRAs by considering these as fallbacks when specific LoRA parameters are not present, allowing for a more flexible and practical setup."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CR Load LoRA node?",
        "answer": "The output types of CR Load LoRA node are `MODEL`, `CLIP`, and `show_help`, which represent the modified model and clip after LoRA adjustments and a URL for additional help documentation, respectively."
