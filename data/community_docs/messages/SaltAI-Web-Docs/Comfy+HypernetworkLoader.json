        "question": "What is HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "HypernetworkLoader is a loader node in ComfyUI designed to enhance or modify the capabilities of a given model by applying a hypernetwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the HypernetworkLoader node load?",
        "answer": "The HypernetworkLoader node loads a specified hypernetwork and applies it to a given model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the strength parameter in HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The strength parameter in HypernetworkLoader adjusts the intensity of the hypernetwork's effect on the model, allowing fine-tuning of its behavior or performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does HypernetworkLoader enhance the model's architecture?",
        "answer": "HypernetworkLoader enhances the model's architecture by applying a hypernetwork patch loaded from a specified path, adjusting model parameters and behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The input types required by HypernetworkLoader include a model (torch.nn.Module), a hypernetwork_name (string), and a strength parameter (float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of HypernetworkLoader?",
        "answer": "The output type of HypernetworkLoader is a modified model (torch.nn.Module) after applying the hypernetwork."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infra does HypernetworkLoader require for usage?",
        "answer": "HypernetworkLoader requires GPU infrastructure for optimal performance."
