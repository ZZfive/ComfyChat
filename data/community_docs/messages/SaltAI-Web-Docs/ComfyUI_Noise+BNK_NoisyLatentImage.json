        "question": "What class in ComfyUI is used for generating tensors of random noise as latent images?",
        "answer": "The class used in ComfyUI for generating tensors of random noise as latent images is `BNK_NoisyLatentImage`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BNK_NoisyLatentImage node output?",
        "answer": "The BNK_NoisyLatentImage node outputs a tensor of random noise structured as latent images for further processing or model input, with the Comfy dtype `LATENT` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type of BNK_NoisyLatentImage specifies the computational resource for generating noise?",
        "answer": "The `source` input type of BNK_NoisyLatentImage specifies the computational resource (CPU or GPU) used for generating the noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what purpose is the `seed` input used in the BNK_NoisyLatentImage node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` input in the BNK_NoisyLatentImage node is used to determine the initialization value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does one configure the width of the latent images generated by BNK_NoisyLatentImage?",
        "answer": "To configure the width of the latent images generated by BNK_NoisyLatentImage, one should set the `width` input, which influences the dimensions of the output noise tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What defines the number of latent images generated in a single batch by BNK_NoisyLatentImage?",
        "answer": "The number of latent images generated in a single batch by BNK_NoisyLatentImage is defined by the `batch_size` input, allowing for batch processing of noise generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does BNK_NoisyLatentImage use to generate random noise?",
        "answer": "BNK_NoisyLatentImage uses the `create_noisy_latents` function to generate random noise by taking seed, width, height, and batch_size as parameters."
