        "question": "What is the primary function of the Image Canny Filter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Canny Filter node in ComfyUI is designed to detect edges in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Canny Filter node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Canny Filter node are an `images` tensor, a boolean flag `enable_threshold`, and two threshold values `threshold_low` and `threshold_high`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is responsible for edge detection in ComfyUI's WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The Image Canny Filter node is responsible for edge detection in ComfyUI's WAS Suite."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the input image processed by the Image Canny Filter node?",
        "answer": "The input image is processed by highlighting its edges, which is useful for image analysis and preprocessing tasks requiring edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `enable_threshold` input do in the Image Canny Filter node?",
        "answer": "The `enable_threshold` input is a boolean flag that enables or disables the thresholding process, affecting how edges are detected based on the specified thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `threshold_low` and `threshold_high` inputs in the Image Canny Filter node?",
        "answer": "The `threshold_low` and `threshold_high` inputs are used to set the lower and upper thresholds for the hysteresis procedure in the edge detection process, determining the minimum and maximum intensity gradients of edges to be considered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Canny Filter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Canny Filter node is the processed image tensor with highlighted edges, which is useful for further image analysis or preprocessing steps."
