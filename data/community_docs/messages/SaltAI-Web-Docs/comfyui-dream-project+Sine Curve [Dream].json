        "question": "What is the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node generates a sine wave based on animation frame data, allowing for dynamic visual effects in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node use?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node utilizes parameters such as maximum and minimum values, periodicity, and phase to shape the sine wave's amplitude and frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'frame_counter' input in the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_counter' input tracks the current time in seconds based on the animation's frame rate, serving as the basis for calculating the sine wave's position."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node calculate the maximum amplitude of the sine wave?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node calculates the maximum amplitude using the 'max_value' parameter, which specifies the peak value the sine wave can reach."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'periodicity_seconds' parameter control in the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node?",
        "answer": "The 'periodicity_seconds' parameter in the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node controls the period of the sine wave, determining how quickly it completes a full cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node adjust the starting position of the sine wave?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node adjusts the starting position of the sine wave using the 'phase' parameter, which shifts its phase within the cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Sine Curve [Dream]' node outputs values of type FLOAT and INT, representing the calculated sine wave value as a floating-point number and as an integer, respectively."
