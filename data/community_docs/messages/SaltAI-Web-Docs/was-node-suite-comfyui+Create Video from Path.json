        "question": "What is the purpose of the Create Video from Path node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Create Video from Path node in ComfyUI facilitates the creation of videos from a sequence of images, allowing for customizable transitions, frame delays, and video properties such as frame rate and resolution. It is ideal for creating morphing effects or slideshows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the smoothness of transitions between images when using the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The smoothness of transitions between images in the Create Video from Path node is determined by the `transition_frames` input, which specifies the number of frames to be used for transitions between images, enabling smooth morphing effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you set the viewing duration of each image in the video created by the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The viewing duration of each image in the video can be set using the `image_delay_sec` input, which determines the delay (in seconds) for each image before transitioning to the next."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the Create Video from Path node specifies the delay for each image in the video?",
        "answer": "The `image_delay_sec` input specifies the delay (in seconds) for each image before transitioning to the next, allowing for control over the viewing duration of each image in the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `max_size` input refer to in the Create Video from Path node?",
        "answer": "The `max_size` input refers to the maximum size (in pixels) for the width or height of the images, ensuring that the video maintains a consistent resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to create a video from a sequence of images?",
        "answer": "The Create Video from Path node in ComfyUI can be used to create a video from a sequence of images, facilitating customizable transitions, frame delays, and video properties."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Create Video from Path node, what determines the frames per second (fps) for the output video?",
        "answer": "The frames per second (fps) for the output video is determined by the `fps` input in the Create Video from Path node."
