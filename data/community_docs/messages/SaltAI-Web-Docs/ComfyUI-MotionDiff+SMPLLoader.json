        "question": "What is the SMPLLoader node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load and process SMPL model data from specified files. It facilitates the integration of SMPL models into motion analysis and synthesis workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which files does the SMPLLoader node specify for loading?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node specifies the file name of the SMPL model to be loaded, which contains essential data for motion synthesis, including pose parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SMPLLoader node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SMPLLoader node are `smpl`, which specifies the file name of the SMPL model, and `smpl_model`, which determines the specific SMPL model to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SMPLLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SMPLLoader node is a tuple containing the path to the SMPL model, pose parameters (thetas), and metadata. This output is ready for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the input and output of the SMPLLoader node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy data type for `smpl` and `smpl_model` inputs are `COMBO[STRING]`, with Python data type `str`. The output is of Comfy data type `SMPL`, and the Python data type is a `Tuple[str, torch.Tensor, Dict]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of hardware does the SMPLLoader node operate?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node operates on a CPU as its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class and category does the SMPLLoader node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SMPLLoader node belongs to the class `SMPLLoader` and is categorized under `MotionDiff/smpl` in ComfyUI."
