        "question": "What is the class name of the CR Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the CR Model Input Switch node is `CR_ModelInputSwitch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'Input' parameter in the CR Model Input Switch?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter determines which model input to select for the workflow based on its value, playing a crucial role in the conditional logic of the CR Model Input Switch node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are supported for the inputs 'model1' and 'model2' in the CR Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The 'model1' and 'model2' inputs in the CR Model Input Switch node support the `MODEL` data type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output parameter of the CR Model Input Switch node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output parameter of the CR Model Input Switch node provides a link to further documentation and help for using this node effectively."

    {
        "question": "Which node would you use in ComfyUI to select a model based on a conditional integer input?",
        "answer": "You would use the CR Model Input Switch node in ComfyUI to select a model based on a conditional integer input."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the selected model determined by the CR Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The CR Model Input Switch node selects the model based on the value of the 'Input' parameter; if 'Input' is 1, it returns 'model1', otherwise it returns 'model2'."
