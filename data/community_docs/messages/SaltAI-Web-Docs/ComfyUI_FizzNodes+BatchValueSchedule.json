        "question": "What is the BatchValueSchedule node used for in the FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/BatchScheduleNodes category?",
        "answer": "The BatchValueSchedule node is used to process a batch of text inputs, applying a scheduling algorithm to generate a sequence of values based on the text's key frames over a specified number of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which classes of input does the BatchValueSchedule node require?",
        "answer": "The BatchValueSchedule node requires three types of input: text, max_frames, and print_output. The text input is the text containing key frames for value generation, max_frames specifies the maximum number of frames for value generation, and print_output is a boolean flag for enabling output printing for debugging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the text input in the BatchValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The text input contains key frames for value generation and plays a crucial role in determining the sequence of generated values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the BatchValueSchedule node produce?",
        "answer": "The BatchValueSchedule node produces two types of output: float and int. The float output represents the generated values as floating-point numbers, and the int output represents these values converted to integers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the duty of the 'print_output' input in the BatchValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_output' input is a boolean flag in the BatchValueSchedule node that, when set to True, enables the debug purpose by printing the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_frames' input determine in the BatchValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' input determines the maximum number of frames for which the BatchValueSchedule node will generate values, effectively defining the length of the output sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output tuple of the BatchValueSchedule node comprised of?",
        "answer": "The output tuple of the BatchValueSchedule node is comprised of the generated values represented first as floating-point numbers and then as integers."
