        "question": "What is the Image Rotate node in WAS Suite used for?",
        "answer": "The Image Rotate node in WAS Suite is designed to rotate a batch of images to a specified angle, with options for different rotation modes and sampling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image Rotate node belong to in WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The Image Rotate node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Transform' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Rotate node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Rotate node include 'images' (a batch of images as List[torch.Tensor]), 'mode' (rotation mode as str), 'rotation' (angle in degrees as int), and 'sampler' (sampling method as str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Rotate node constrain rotation angles?",
        "answer": "The Image Rotate node ensures that rotations are constrained within a 360-degree range and supports adjustments to the rotation angle for more precise control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter in the Image Rotate node control?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the Image Rotate node specifies the rotation mode, either 'internal' for direct rotation or an alternative mode involving transposing the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used to rotate images in the WAS Suite as per the provided documentation?",
        "answer": "The Image Rotate node is used to rotate images in the WAS Suite as per the provided documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Rotate node in terms of data types?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Rotate node is a batch of rotated images returned as a tensor, with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
