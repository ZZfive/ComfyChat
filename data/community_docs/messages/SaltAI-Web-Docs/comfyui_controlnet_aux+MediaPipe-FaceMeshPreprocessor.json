        "question": "What is the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for detecting and processing facial features in images using the MediaPipe library, with a focus on identifying faces and their key landmarks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node belongs to the category 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Faces and Poses Estimators' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is an `image`, which is the input image to be processed for face detection and landmark annotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node include `max_faces`, which specifies the maximum number of faces to detect; `min_confidence`, which determines the minimum confidence level for a face detection; and `resolution`, which defines the processing resolution of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is `image`, which is an image annotated with detected facial landmarks, including key points and contours for facial features."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node ensure the accuracy of face detections?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node ensures the accuracy of face detections by allowing users to set `min_confidence` to a specific value, which acts as a threshold for accepting detections based on their confidence level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node can users adjust to control the number of faces processed?",
        "answer": "Users can adjust the `max_faces` parameter in the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node to control the maximum number of faces to detect in an image."
