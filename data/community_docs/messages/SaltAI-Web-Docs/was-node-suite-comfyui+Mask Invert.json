        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Invert node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Invert node in ComfyUI is designed to invert the values of a given mask, effectively flipping the masked and unmasked regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which category does the Mask Invert node fall in the ComfyUI interface?",
        "answer": "The Mask Invert node falls under the category 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' in the ComfyUI interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the input 'masks' of the Mask Invert node require?",
        "answer": "The input 'masks' of the Mask Invert node requires a 'MASK' data type, which corresponds to 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly paired with the Mask Invert node for processing images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes to be paired with the Mask Invert node for processing images in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the Mask Invert node output?",
        "answer": "The Mask Invert node outputs a data type of 'MASK', which is represented as 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Mask Invert node be run on a GPU?",
        "answer": "No, the Mask Invert node is designed to run on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method is used by the Mask Invert node to invert the values of the input mask?",
        "answer": "The Mask Invert node uses the method `add_masks(self, masks)` where the inverted mask is calculated using the formula `1. - masks`."
