        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Crop Region node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Crop Region node in ComfyUI is designed to crop a specified region from a given mask based on the region type (dominant or minority) and an optional padding, which enhances the focus on regions of interest within masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Mask Crop Region node are `mask` (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), `padding` (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and `region_type` (Comfy dtype: COMBO[STRING], Python dtype: str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `region_type` input specify in the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The `region_type` input in the Mask Crop Region node specifies whether the dominant or minority region within the mask is to be cropped."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type provides the detailed information about the dimensions of the cropped region in the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_data` output type in the Mask Crop Region node provides detailed information about the dimensions and coordinates of the cropped region."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the area of interest for cropping in the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input determines the area of interest for cropping in the Mask Crop Region node by representing the image mask from which a specific region is to be cropped."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `padding` input affect the output of the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The `padding` input affects the output of the Mask Crop Region node by specifying the additional space to be added around the cropped region, allowing for more flexibility in the size of the output region and potentially including more context around the targeted area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the `region_type` input in the Mask Crop Region node?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the `region_type` input in the Mask Crop Region node are `dominant` and `minority`."
