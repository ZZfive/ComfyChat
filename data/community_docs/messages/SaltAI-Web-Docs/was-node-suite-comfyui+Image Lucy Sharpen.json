        "question": "What is the Image Lucy Sharpen node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Lucy Sharpen node in ComfyUI is used to apply a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution algorithm to sharpen images by enhancing the contrast of edges and deblurring through convolutions with a specified kernel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Lucy Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Lucy Sharpen node are `images` (INPUT: the image data to be sharpened), `iterations` (the number of times the sharpening process is applied), and `kernel_size` (the size of the convolution kernel used for sharpening)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `images` parameter of the Image Lucy Sharpen node impact the sharpening process?",
        "answer": "The `images` parameter determines the base images that undergo the sharpening process. It is crucial for the operation of the node, as it is the input data to be manipulated and enhanced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `iterations` input control in the Image Lucy Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The `iterations` input controls the number of times the sharpening process is applied to the images. Higher values result in a more pronounced sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the `kernel_size` input have on the sharpening process of the Image Lucy Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The `kernel_size` input determines the size of the convolution kernel used for sharpening. When the kernel size is larger, it can lead to a smoother but nonetheless sharpened effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used together with the Image Lucy Sharpen node?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node is a common node used in conjunction with the Image Lucy Sharpen node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Lucy Sharpen node return as output?",
        "answer": "The Image Lucy Sharpen node returns `image`, which is the output sharpened images with enhanced edges and details, in the form of a List[PIL.Image] or PIL.Image."
