        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatch node is designed to combine two images into a single batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageBatch handle images with different dimensions?",
        "answer": "ImageBatch automatically rescales the second image to match the dimensions of the first image before combining them into a batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatch node requires two inputs: 'image1' and 'image2'. 'image1' serves as the reference for dimensions, and 'image2' is rescaled to match 'image1' if necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ImageBatch produce?",
        "answer": "ImageBatch produces an output of type 'IMAGE', which is a combined batch of images with the second image adjusted to match the dimensions of the first one."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the common usage environment for ImageBatch?",
        "answer": "ImageBatch is commonly used in GPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can ImageBatch handle non-image data?",
        "answer": "No, ImageBatch specifically operates on images ('IMAGE' type) as inputs and outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which other nodes are commonly used alongside ImageBatch?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes alongside ImageBatch include IPAdapterApply, CR Batch Process Switch, PreviewImage, and Preview Chooser."
