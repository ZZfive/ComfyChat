        "question": "What is the InpaintPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is used for preparing images for inpainting tasks by applying a mask to the input image, marking specified areas as needing inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node requires the 'image' parameter, which is the input image that needs inpainting, and the 'mask' parameter, which specifies the areas within the image that require inpainting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the InpaintPreprocessor node represents the input image that needs inpainting, and it is crucial for defining the areas that will remain unchanged during the inpainting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter represent in the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the InpaintPreprocessor node specifies the areas within the image that require inpainting. It identifies which parts of the image should be processed or filled by the inpainting algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the InpaintPreprocessor node is a modified version of the input image, where areas specified by the mask are marked for inpainting, ready for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the InpaintPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvanced and ImageScale nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the InpaintPreprocessor node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the InpaintPreprocessor node set as masked pixels in the output image?",
        "answer": "The InpaintPreprocessor node sets pixels to -1.0 where the mask value is greater than 0.5, indicating that these are the pixels that need to be inpainted."
