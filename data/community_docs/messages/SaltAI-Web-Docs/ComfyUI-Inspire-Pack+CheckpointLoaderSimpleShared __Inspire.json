        "question": "What is the purpose of the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire node is designed to manage the loading and caching of model checkpoints in a shared manner, allowing for efficient reuse of loaded checkpoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node should be used in ComfyUI for handling model checkpoints in a read-only or override cache mode?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire node is the node to use for handling model checkpoints in either read-only or override cache mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ckpt_name` input parameter in CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire represent?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` input parameter represents the name of the checkpoint to load. It is crucial for identifying which checkpoint file to retrieve and load."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire nodes cache the same checkpoint under different keys?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire node can cache the same checkpoint under different keys, providing flexibility for managing the cache."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire provide when a model checkpoint is loaded?",
        "answer": "When a model checkpoint is loaded, CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire outputs the loaded model, the CLIP model if available, the VAE model if available, and the key under which the checkpoint is cached."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtypes for the REQUIRED input `key_opt` in the CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the REQUIRED input `key_opt` in CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire is `STRING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What caching modes does CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire support, and how do they affect the handling of checkpoints?",
        "answer": "CheckpointLoaderSimpleShared __Inspire supports 'Read Only' and 'Override Cache' modes, which determine if the checkpoint should be handled strictly from cache or can be overridden and stored in cache."
