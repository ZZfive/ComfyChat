        "question": "What is the UnTonemap node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node in ComfyUI is used to reverse the effects of tonemapping on images, restoring them to their original linear or sRGB color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input should be provided for the images parameter in the UnTonemap node?",
        "answer": "The images parameter in the UnTonemap node requires images as input, which is represented by the dtype IMAGE in ComfyUI and as a torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the input_mode parameter in the UnTonemap node?",
        "answer": "The input_mode parameter in the UnTonemap node specifies the color space of the input images. It can be set to either 'sRGB' or 'linear' to determine the initial conversion step before untonemapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the tonemap_scale parameter influence the untonemapping process?",
        "answer": "The tonemap_scale parameter in the UnTonemap node applies a scaling factor during the untonemapping process to adjust the intensity of the effect on the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the UnTonemap node represent?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node outputs the untonemapped images, returned in the specified output color space, either 'linear' or 'sRGB', as represented by the dtype IMAGE in ComfyUI and as a torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can reverse the effects of tonemapping on images?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node in ComfyUI is designed to reverse the effects of tonemapping on images, converting them back to their original linear or sRGB color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types that the UnTonemap node generates?",
        "answer": "The UnTonemap node generates output types in the form of IMAGE, specifically the untonemapped images in the specified output color space, either 'linear' or 'sRGB'."
