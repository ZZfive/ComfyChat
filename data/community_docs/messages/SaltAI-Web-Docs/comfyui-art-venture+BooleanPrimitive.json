        "question": "What is the BooleanPrimitive node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The BooleanPrimitive node in ComfyUI is designed to manipulate boolean values, offering functionality to either pass through the input boolean value as is or reverse it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'reverse' parameter in the BooleanPrimitive node?",
        "answer": "The 'reverse' parameter in the BooleanPrimitive node determines whether the input boolean value should be reversed. When set to True, the output will be the logical negation of the input, enabling dynamic control over boolean logic flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the BooleanPrimitive node besides 'boolean'?",
        "answer": "Besides 'boolean', the BooleanPrimitive node also outputs a 'string' type which is a string representation of the resulting boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the BooleanPrimitive node within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You can find the BooleanPrimitive node within the 'Art Venture/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BooleanPrimitive node return when the 'reverse' parameter is set to True?",
        "answer": "When the 'reverse' parameter is set to True, the BooleanPrimitive node returns the logical negation of the input boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the BooleanPrimitive node is central to its operation and determines the base value that may be reversed?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter in the BooleanPrimitive node is central to its operation and determines the base value that may be reversed based on the 'reverse' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the resulting boolean value from the BooleanPrimitive node represented in Python?",
        "answer": "The resulting boolean value from the BooleanPrimitive node is represented as a `bool` type in Python."
