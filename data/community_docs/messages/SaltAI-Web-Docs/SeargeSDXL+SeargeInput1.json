        "question": "What is the purpose of SeargeInput1 in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SeargeInput1 is designed to aggregate and organize various textual prompts and styles into a unified parameter set for further processing in ComfyUI. It acts as a multiplexer, combining multiple inputs into a single, structured output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SeargeInput1?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SeargeInput1 include `main_prompt`, `secondary_prompt`, `style_prompt`, `negative_prompt`, and `negative_style`. These inputs provide the primary text prompts and guidance for content generation and modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `main_prompt` used for in SeargeInput1?",
        "answer": "The `main_prompt` in SeargeInput1 is the primary text prompt for generating or influencing content. It serves as the main input for content creation or modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type is associated with the `style_prompt` input type in SeargeInput1?",
        "answer": "The Python data type associated with the `style_prompt` input type in SeargeInput1 is `str`, which represents a string of text that specifies the desired style or tone for the content being generated or modified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional inputs does SeargeInput1 accept besides those required?",
        "answer": "SeargeInput1 accepts optional inputs including `inputs`, `image`, and `mask`. These inputs allow for dynamic input aggregation and modification, and can be used to influence the content generation process with predefined inputs and specific image features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `inputs` parameter in SeargeInput1 represent?",
        "answer": "The `inputs` parameter in SeargeInput1 is an optional parameter that allows passing in previously defined inputs. This enables dynamic input aggregation and modification for further processing in the generation of content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for SeargeInput1 in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type for SeargeInput1 is `PARAMETER_INPUTS`, which is a dictionary (`dict` in Python) containing the aggregated set of parameters from the various prompts, styles, and optional image and mask inputs, structured for further processing."
