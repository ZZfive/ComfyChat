        "question": "What is the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch (JPS) node is designed to select and output one of several conditioning inputs based on a specified selection index, facilitating dynamic control over which conditioning data is passed forward in a processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Conditioning Switch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch node belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select' parameter in the Conditioning Switch node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter in Conditioning Switch node determines which conditioning input to output, based on its numerical index, controlling the flow of different conditioning contexts through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can dynamically select conditioning data based on a numerical index?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch (JPS) node can dynamically select conditioning data based on a numerical index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of 'con_out' in the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of 'con_out' in the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node is 'CONDITIONING', which facilitates dynamic switching between different conditioning contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many optional conditioning inputs are allowed in the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch (JPS) node allows for up to five optional conditioning inputs, ranging from 'con_1' to 'con_5'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node executed, in terms of system resources?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch (JPS) node is executed on the CPU, as indicated by its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does the Conditioning Switch (JPS) node support?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Switch (JPS) node supports both a required 'select' input of type 'INT' and optional 'con_i' inputs of type 'CONDITIONING' where 'i' can range from 1 to 5."
