        "question": "What is the CR Pipe Switch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Pipe Switch node in ComfyUI is used to dynamically select between two pipeline paths based on a specified input, facilitating conditional execution within a pipeline for more flexible and customizable data processing flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Pipe Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Pipe Switch node include an 'Input' of type INT to determine the pipeline path, 'pipe1' for the first potential pipeline of type PIPE_LINE, and 'pipe2' for the second potential pipeline also of type PIPE_LINE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Input' parameter of the CR Pipe Switch node control?",
        "answer": "The 'Input' parameter of the CR Pipe Switch node controls which pipeline path to select for execution; a value of 1 selects the 'pipe1' path, and any other value selects the 'pipe2' path."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the CR Pipe Switch node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Pipe Switch node outputs the selected pipeline path of type PIPE_LINE based on the 'Input' parameter, and a 'show_help' url of type STRING providing additional documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the value of 1 indicate in the 'Input' parameter of the CR Pipe Switch node?",
        "answer": "A value of 1 in the 'Input' parameter of the CR Pipe Switch node indicates that the 'pipe1' pathway should be selected for execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node dynamically selects between two pipeline paths in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Pipe Switch node dynamically selects between two pipeline paths based on a specified input in ComfyUI, enabling conditional execution and customizable data processing flows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CR Pipe Switch node other than the pipeline path?",
        "answer": "In addition to the selected pipeline path output, the CR Pipe Switch node outputs a 'show_help' url of type STRING, providing links to additional documentation and information."
