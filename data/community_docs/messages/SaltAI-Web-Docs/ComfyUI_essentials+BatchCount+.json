        "question": "What is the BatchCount+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "BatchCount+ is a node in ComfyUI designed to count the number of elements in a batch, handling tensors, dictionaries, and lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data structures can the BatchCount+ node handle?",
        "answer": "The BatchCount+ node can handle various data structures including tensors, dictionaries containing 'samples', and lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter does the BatchCount+ node require?",
        "answer": "The BatchCount+ node requires the 'batch' parameter, representing the batch of data whose size is to be counted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the 'batch' parameter accept in BatchCount+?",
        "answer": "The 'batch' parameter in BatchCount+ accepts a union of torch.Tensor, Dict[str, Any], and List[Any] data types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the BatchCount+ node provide?",
        "answer": "The BatchCount+ node provides an integer output representing the count of elements in the input batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the BatchCount+ node compatible with?",
        "answer": "The BatchCount+ node is compatible with CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does BatchCount+ determine the count of elements in a tensor?",
        "answer": "If the 'batch' is a tensor, BatchCount+ determines the count by accessing the tensor's shape attribute and returning the length of the first dimension."
