        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Input Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively output one of two input images based on a boolean condition, enabling dynamic image processing flows that can change based on conditional logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Input Switch node are `image_a`, `image_b`, and `boolean`. `image_a` and `image_b` are the two image input options for the switch, and `boolean` is the input that determines which image is output by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of `image_a` and `image_b` in the context of ComfyUI's Image Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of `image_a` and `image_b` in the context of ComfyUI's Image Input Switch node is `IMAGE` in Comfy dtype, and `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Input Switch node determine which image to output?",
        "answer": "The Image Input Switch node determines which image to output based on the `boolean` input. If `boolean` is true, `image_a` is output; if false, `image_b` is output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can be used in conjunction with the Image Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can be used in conjunction with the Image Input Switch node include `PreviewImage` and `ImageCompositeMasked`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python function associated with the Image Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Python function associated with the Image Input Switch node is `image_input_switch`, which takes in `image_a`, `image_b`, and `boolean` as parameters and returns the appropriate image based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Input Switch node output?",
        "answer": "The Image Input Switch node outputs an image, depending on the boolean condition, with a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
