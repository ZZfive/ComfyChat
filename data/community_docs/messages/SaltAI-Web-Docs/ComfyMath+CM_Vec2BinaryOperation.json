        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2BinaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2BinaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec2' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_Vec2BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec2BinaryOperation specifies the binary operation to be performed on the vectors. It determines how the two input vectors will be combined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec2BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_Vec2BinaryOperation include 'op' of type COMBO[STRING], 'a' of type VEC2, and 'b' of type VEC2."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vec2' output represent in CM_Vec2BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'vec2' output in CM_Vec2BinaryOperation represents the resulting two-dimensional vector after applying the specified binary operation on the input vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output 'vec2' represented in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, the 'vec2' output is represented as a tuple containing Vec2 elements."
    },
