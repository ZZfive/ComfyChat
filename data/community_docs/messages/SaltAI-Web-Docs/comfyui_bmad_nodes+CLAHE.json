        "question": "What is the CLAHE node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The CLAHE node in ComfyUI is used to apply the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization algorithm, enhancing the contrast of images by adjusting image intensities locally."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does CLAHE belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CLAHE belongs to the category 'Bmad/CV/Thresholding' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `clip_limit` parameter play in the CLAHE node?",
        "answer": "The `clip_limit` parameter in the CLAHE node defines the threshold for contrast limiting, helping control the enhancement of contrast to prevent amplifying noise in homogeneous regions of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are images divided when using the CLAHE node?",
        "answer": "Images are divided into tiles based on the parameters `tile_grid_x` and `tile_grid_y`, determining the granularity of the contrast enhancement process in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CLAHE node output?",
        "answer": "The CLAHE node outputs an enhanced image after applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization, which is tagged as type `IMAGE` and represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter specifies the number of tiles in the vertical direction for dividing the image in CLAHE?",
        "answer": "The `tile_grid_y` parameter specifies the number of tiles in the vertical direction for dividing the image in the CLAHE node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is CLAHE classified as a GPU or CPU node?",
        "answer": "CLAHE is classified as a GPU node according to the 'Infra type' category."
