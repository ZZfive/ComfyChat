        "question": "What is the SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI is designed to universally display any type of input data, converting it into a human-readable format or indicating if the data type cannot be displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data can the SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI handle?",
        "answer": "The SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI can handle a wide range of data types, including basic types like strings and numbers, complex data structures like dictionaries and lists, and even PyTorch tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltDisplayAny node in ComfyUI provides a human-readable representation of the input data or a message indicating that the data type cannot be displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter does SaltDisplayAny require?",
        "answer": "SaltDisplayAny requires the `input_value` parameter, which accepts any data type and determines the content that will be converted into a readable format or indicated as non-displayable, depending on the data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltDisplayAny node do with PyTorch tensors?",
        "answer": "When the SaltDisplayAny node encounters a PyTorch tensor, it displays the shape of the tensor as a human-readable output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SaltDisplayAny handle unserializable data structures?",
        "answer": "If the input data to SaltDisplayAny cannot be serialized, such as with complex data structures, it outputs 'Data could not be serialized.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SaltDisplayAny output for unsupported data types?",
        "answer": "For unsupported data types, SaltDisplayAny outputs a message stating, 'Data type {type(input_value).__name__} cannot be displayed.'"
