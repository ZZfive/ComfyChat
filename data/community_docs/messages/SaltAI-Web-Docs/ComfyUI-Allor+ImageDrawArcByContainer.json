        "question": "What is ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawArcByContainer is a class in ComfyUI under the category image/draw, designed to draw an arc on an image based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the essential inputs required by ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "ImageDrawArcByContainer requires inputs such as the image container, arc size, start and end coordinates, arc angles, color components (red, green, blue), alpha level, SSAA level, and drawing method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageDrawArcByContainer define the thickness of the arc?",
        "answer": "The thickness of the arc in ImageDrawArcByContainer is defined by the 'size' parameter, which specifies the thickness of the arc to be drawn on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is SSAA in the context of ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "SSAA in ImageDrawArcByContainer stands for supersampling anti-aliasing, which enhances the visual quality of the drawn arc by reducing aliasing artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the method parameter affect the drawing process in ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in ImageDrawArcByContainer determines the technique used for drawing the arc, influencing the rendering quality and characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "The output of ImageDrawArcByContainer is an image with the specified arc drawn on it, reflecting the input parameters and modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'container' input expect in ImageDrawArcByContainer?",
        "answer": "The 'container' input in ImageDrawArcByContainer expects an image specified as a numpy.ndarray in Python and labeled as IMAGE in ComfyUI."
