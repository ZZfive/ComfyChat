        "question": "What is the class name for the AlphaMatte node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the AlphaMatte node in ComfyUI is `AlphaMatte`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the AlphaMatte node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AlphaMatte node belongs to the `image/filters` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the AlphaMatte node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the AlphaMatte node in ComfyUI is to extract and refine the alpha matte of images, which helps in accurately separating the foreground from the background, even in complex scenes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the AlphaMatte node, and what are their respective data types?",
        "answer": "The input types required for the AlphaMatte node are `images` (IMAGE/torch.Tensor), `alpha_trimap` (IMAGE/torch.Tensor), `preblur` (INT/int), `blackpoint` (FLOAT/float), `whitepoint` (FLOAT/float), `max_iterations` (INT/int), and `estimate_fg` (COMBO[STRING]/str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `alpha_trimap` parameter do in the AlphaMatte node?",
        "answer": "The `alpha_trimap` parameter in the AlphaMatte node provides an initial guess of the foreground, background, and unknown areas which guides the matte extraction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AlphaMatte node adjust the contrast of the trimap?",
        "answer": "The AlphaMatte node adjusts the contrast of the trimap by using the `blackpoint` parameter, which is the black point value that aids in clearer separation of the foreground from the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used in ComfyUI for advanced image processing specifically focusing on extracting and refining the alpha matte of images?",
        "answer": "The AlphaMatte node in ComfyUI is specifically designed for advanced image processing, focusing on extracting and refining the alpha matte of images."
