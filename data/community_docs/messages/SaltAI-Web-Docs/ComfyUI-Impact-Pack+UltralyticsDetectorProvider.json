        "question": "What is the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UltralyticsDetectorProvider node in ComfyUI is designed to load and provide access to detection models, facilitating object detection tasks by leveraging models trained with the Ultralytics framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The UltralyticsDetectorProvider node outputs two types: `bbox_detector` and `segm_detector`. The `bbox_detector` provides an object detector that identifies bounding boxes around detected objects in images, and the `segm_detector` offers a segmentation model capable of delineating the precise shape of objects by classifying each pixel of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the `segm_detector` output from the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the `segm_detector` output from the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node is `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `model_name` input in the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node responsible for?",
        "answer": "The `model_name` input in the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node specifies the name of the model to be loaded, which is crucial for identifying and accessing the correct model file for object detection tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used in combination with the UltralyticsDetectorProvider in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Nodes that can be used in combination with the UltralyticsDetectorProvider in ComfyUI include FaceDetailer, BboxDetectorSEGS, ToDetailerPipe, ImpactSimpleDetectorSEGS, Reroute, ImpactSimpleDetectorSEGS_for_AD, SegmDetectorSEGS, and ToDetailerPipeSDXL."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the UltralyticsDetectorProvider determine whether to return a bounding box detector or a segmentation detector?",
        "answer": "The UltralyticsDetectorProvider determines whether to return a bounding box detector or a segmentation detector based on the `model_name` input. If `model_name` starts with \"bbox\", it returns a bounding box detector; otherwise, it returns both a bounding box detector and a segmentation detector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UltralyticsDetectorProvider node belongs to the \"ImpactPack\" category in ComfyUI."
