        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeCheckpointLoader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCheckpointLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load specific checkpoints from a predefined repository and abstracts the complexity of checkpoint loading mechanisms to provide a simplified interface for retrieving model, CLIP, and VAE components based on checkpoint names."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the name of the class for the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the SeargeCheckpointLoader node is `SeargeCheckpointLoader`."

    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `ckpt_name` parameter when loading a checkpoint?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `ckpt_name` parameter when loading a checkpoint is `str` in Python and `CHECKPOINT_NAME` in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the components that can be loaded by the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeCheckpointLoader node can load the model, CLIP, and VAE components from the specified checkpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which specific Python module does the model component from the checkpoint belong to?",
        "answer": "The model component from the checkpoint loaded by the SeargeCheckpointLoader node belongs to the `torch.nn.Module` Python module."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function is responsible for loading the checkpoint in the SeargeCheckpointLoader node?",
        "answer": "The function `load_checkpoint` is responsible for loading the checkpoint in the SeargeCheckpointLoader node."
