        "question": "What is unCLIPConditioning?",
        "answer": "unCLIPConditioning is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to integrate CLIP vision outputs into the conditioning process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does unCLIPConditioning enhance?",
        "answer": "unCLIPConditioning enhances the conditioning process by enriching it with visual context from CLIP vision outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for unCLIPConditioning?",
        "answer": "The input types required for unCLIPConditioning include 'conditioning', 'clip_vision_output', 'strength', and 'noise_augmentation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does strength affect unCLIPConditioning?",
        "answer": "Strength in unCLIPConditioning determines the intensity of the influence of CLIP vision outputs on the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of noise_augmentation in unCLIPConditioning?",
        "answer": "Noise augmentation in unCLIPConditioning specifies the level of noise to apply to the CLIP vision output before integrating it into the conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of unCLIPConditioning?",
        "answer": "The output type of unCLIPConditioning is 'conditioning', which is enriched with integrated CLIP vision outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does unCLIPConditioning integrate CLIP vision outputs?",
        "answer": "unCLIPConditioning integrates CLIP vision outputs by adjusting their influence based on specified strength and noise augmentation parameters."
