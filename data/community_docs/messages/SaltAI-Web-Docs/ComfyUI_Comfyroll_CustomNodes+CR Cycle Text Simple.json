        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Cycle Text Simple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Text Simple node is designed to cycle through a list of text strings in a specified mode, allowing for dynamic text animation within a sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CR Cycle Text Simple node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Text Simple node belongs to the category 'ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/ðŸŽ¥ Animation/ðŸ’€ Legacy' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'frame_interval' input control in the CR Cycle Text Simple node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' input controls the interval, in frames, between each text change, which affects the speed of the text cycling animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you add multiple text strings to the cycling animation using the CR Cycle Text Simple node?",
        "answer": "You can add multiple text strings to the cycling animation using the CR Cycle Text Simple node by specifying them individually as 'text_1', 'text_2', etc., or by using the 'text_list_simple' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'loops' parameter specify in the CR Cycle Text Simple node?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' parameter specifies the number of times the entire text list is repeated, which affects the total duration of the text cycling animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by CR Cycle Text Simple?",
        "answer": "CR Cycle Text Simple provides the outputs: a string that is currently selected to be displayed based on the mode, frame interval, loops, and current frame, and a URL to a help page."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for CR Cycle Text Simple?",
        "answer": "The class name for CR Cycle Text Simple is 'CR_CycleTextSimple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What mode is currently supported by CR Cycle Text Simple for cycling the texts?",
        "answer": "CR Cycle Text Simple supports the cycling mode 'Sequential', which enables the texts to be displayed one after another in order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'current_frame' input represent in the CR Cycle Text Simple node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input represents the current frame number in the animation sequence, which is used to determine which text string should be displayed based on the frame interval and loops."
