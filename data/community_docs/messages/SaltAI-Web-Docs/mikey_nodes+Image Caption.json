        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Caption node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Caption node in ComfyUI is designed to add textual captions to images, processing an image tensor and overlaying the caption onto the image, potentially incorporating additional metadata into the image's PNG info."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a required input for the Image Caption node?",
        "answer": "A required input for the Image Caption node is `image`, which is the image tensor to which the caption will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Caption node handle fonts for the caption text?",
        "answer": "The Image Caption node specifies the font to be used for the caption text through the `font` input, which influences the aesthetic presentation of the caption."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of the input `image` for the Image Caption node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the input `image` is `IMAGE`, and the Python dtype is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Caption node handle the text content of the caption?",
        "answer": "The Image Caption node receives the text content of the caption through the `caption` input, formats and wraps this text to fit within the image's dimensions, and overlays it onto the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Image Caption node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Image Caption node is `image`, with the comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `PIL.Image`, representing the modified image with the caption overlayed, potentially including additional PNG metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type specified for the Image Caption node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Infra type for the Image Caption node in ComfyUI is specified as `CPU`."
