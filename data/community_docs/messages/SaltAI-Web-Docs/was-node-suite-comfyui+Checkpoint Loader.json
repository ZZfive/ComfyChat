        "question": "What is the purpose of the Checkpoint Loader node in the WAS Suite/Loaders/Advanced category?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Loader node is used for advanced loading operations, specifically to load models, CLIP, and VAE from specified checkpoints and configuration files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What components does the Checkpoint Loader node restore to their saved states?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Loader node restores components such as models, CLIP, and VAE to their saved states, enabling the continuation of work or further manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `config_name` input in the Checkpoint Loader node?",
        "answer": "The `config_name` input in the Checkpoint Loader node specifies the name of the configuration file to be used for loading, which is crucial in determining the setup and parameters of the components to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ckpt_name` input represent in the Checkpoint Loader node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` input in the Checkpoint Loader node indicates the name of the checkpoint file from which the components are to be loaded, containing the saved state of the components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Checkpoint Loader node output?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Loader node outputs data types including `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, and `NAME_STRING`, represented in Python as `torch.nn.Module` for `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, and `str` for `NAME_STRING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `NAME_STRING` output generated in the Checkpoint Loader node?",
        "answer": "The `NAME_STRING` output in the Checkpoint Loader node is derived from the checkpoint file, providing an identifier for the loaded components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is required to use the Checkpoint Loader node?",
        "answer": "The Checkpoint Loader node requires an `INFRA` type of `GPU` to be utilized effectively."
