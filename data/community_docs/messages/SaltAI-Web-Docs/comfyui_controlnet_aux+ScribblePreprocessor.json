        "question": "What is the purpose of the ScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node is designed for preprocessing images to detect scribble lines, utilizing a specific model to analyze and process the input image, aiming to highlight or extract scribble-like patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ScribblePreprocessor node is the 'image', representing the input image to be processed for scribble line detection. The optional input type is 'resolution', specifying the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, affecting the detail level of the scribble line detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input parameter represent in the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter represents the input image to be processed for scribble line detection. It is crucial as it provides the visual data on which the scribble detection model operates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ScribblePreprocessor node and what does it signify?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ScribblePreprocessor node is 'image', which represents the processed image with scribble lines detected or highlighted. This output is useful for further processing or visualization of scribble patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that ScribblePreprocessor can be used in conjunction with?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that ScribblePreprocessor can be used in conjunction with include the PreviewImage node and the ControlNetApplyAdvanced node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class is used to implement the ScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node is implemented using the 'Scribble_Preprocessor' class in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is recommended for executing the ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The ScribblePreprocessor node is recommended to be executed on a GPU infrastructure."
