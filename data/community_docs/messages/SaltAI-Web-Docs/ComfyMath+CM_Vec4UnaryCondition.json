        "question": "What is CM_Vec4UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryCondition is a class in ComfyUI that performs unary operations on 4-dimensional vectors based on predefined conditions, evaluating to a boolean result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec4UnaryCondition belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryCondition belongs to the category 'math/vec4' in ComfyUI."
    },

        "question": "What is the output node of CM_Vec4UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The output node of CM_Vec4UnaryCondition is 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec4UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_Vec4UnaryCondition are 'op' and 'a'. 'op' specifies the unary operation to be performed on the vector, and 'a' is the 4-dimensional vector to be operated on."
    },

        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'op' input in CM_Vec4UnaryCondition?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'op' input in CM_Vec4UnaryCondition is 'COMBO[STRING]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec4UnaryCondition abstract complex vector operations?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4UnaryCondition abstracts complex vector operations into simple, condition-based checks."
    },
