        "question": "What is the CLIP Input Switch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Input Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to toggle between two CLIP model inputs based on a boolean condition, enhancing flexibility in processing visual content within workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean condition is true in the CLIP Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean condition is true in the CLIP Input Switch node, the first CLIP model input (`clip_a`) is selected as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used to dynamically select between two CLIP model inputs in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `CLIP Input Switch` node can be used to dynamically select between two CLIP model inputs (`clip_a` and `clip_b`) in ComfyUI workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the inputs of the CLIP Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types for the inputs of the CLIP Input Switch node are `CLIP` for `clip_a` and `clip_b`, and `bool` for the `boolean` condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CLIP Input Switch node handle the selection of CLIP model inputs?",
        "answer": "The CLIP Input Switch node handles the selection of CLIP model inputs by using a boolean condition (`boolean`). If `boolean` is true, `clip_a` is selected; if false, `clip_b` is selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the CLIP Input Switch node perform in the context of ComfyUI logic?",
        "answer": "In the context of ComfyUI logic, the CLIP Input Switch node performs the function of a conditional selection switch for CLIP model inputs, enabling dynamic workflow adaptability."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CLIP Input Switch node operate only on GPU infrastructures?",
        "answer": "No, the CLIP Input Switch node can operate on CPU infrastructures as indicated by the 'Infra type: CPU' in the node documentation."
