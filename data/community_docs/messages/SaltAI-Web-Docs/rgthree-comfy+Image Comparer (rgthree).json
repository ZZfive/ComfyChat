        "question": "What is the Image Comparer (rgthree) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Comparer (rgthree) node in ComfyUI is used to compare two images side by side to evaluate their differences or similarities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional inputs for the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the Image Comparer (rgthree) node is `image_a`, the primary image. The optional input is `image_b`, which is the secondary image to compare against the primary image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the `image_b` is not provided to the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "If `image_b` is not provided, the Image Comparer (rgthree) node will use a second image from the `image_a` batch for comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `image_a` input in the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The `image_a` input in the Image Comparer (rgthree) node has a Comfy data type of `IMAGE`, which corresponds to a Python data type of `Tuple[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the optional `image_b` input in the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the optional `image_b` input in the Image Comparer (rgthree) node is `Optional[Tuple[torch.Tensor]]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What raises an error when using the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "An error is raised if there are not two images available for comparison, either in both `image_a` and `image_b` or within the batch of `image_a`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of hardware is best suited for the Image Comparer (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Image Comparer (rgthree) node is best suited for CPU infrastructure."
