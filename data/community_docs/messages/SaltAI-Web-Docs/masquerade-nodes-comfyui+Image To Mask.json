        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image To Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image To Mask node in ComfyUI is designed to convert images into masks based on specified criteria, providing flexibility in the method of conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does Image To Mask belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Image To Mask belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does the Image To Mask node require?",
        "answer": "The Image To Mask node requires an 'image' input, which is the source image to convert, and a 'method' input specifying the conversion method, such as 'intensity' or 'alpha' for generating the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected data type for the 'mask' output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The data type for the 'mask' output in ComfyUI is 'MASK', and in Python, it is represented as a 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'method' parameter in the Image To Mask node on the mask generation?",
        "answer": "The 'method' parameter in the Image To Mask node determines the approach used for generating the mask from the input image, offering options such as intensity-based or alpha channel-based conversions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to invert a mask in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node can be used to invert a mask in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Image To Mask node process images with a GPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Image To Mask node supports GPU processing, indicated by its 'Infra type: GPU'."
