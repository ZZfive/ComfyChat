        "question": "What is the primary function of the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerAdvanced inspire node is designed to enhance the sampling process in generative models, specifically tailored for the Inspire pack, to improve the quality and efficiency of generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific role does the 'model' input play in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node specifies the generative model used for the sampling process, which is the core component around which the sampling operation revolves."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'add_noise' input influence the output in KSamplerAdvanced inspire?",
        "answer": "The 'add_noise' input in KSamplerAdvanced inspire determines whether noise should be added to the sampling process, which enhances the diversity and quality of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cfg' input in KSamplerAdvanced inspire determine?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' input in KSamplerAdvanced inspire specifies the conditioning-free guidance scale, which influences the direction and strength of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the effects of the 'return_with_leftover_noise' input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'return_with_leftover_noise' input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node indicates whether to return the sample with leftover noise, offering additional control over the output's final appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node controls the starting point of the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The 'start_at_step' input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node specifies the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for mid-process interventions or adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent_image' input imply in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' input in the KSamplerAdvanced inspire node is an input of a latent image representation to be used or modified during the sampling process."
