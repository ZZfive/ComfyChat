        "question": "What is the 'easy if' node?",
        "answer": "The 'easy if' node is a conditional logic gate within ComfyUI that allows for executing different paths or operations based on specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the 'easy if' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'easy if' node include 'any', 'if', and 'else'. 'Any' serves as a generic input, 'if' defines the condition to be evaluated, and 'else' specifies an alternative path if the 'if' condition is not met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the 'easy if' node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the 'easy if' node can vary ('*'), depending on the evaluation of the 'if' condition, allowing for different possible outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'easy if' node handle conditional logic?",
        "answer": "The 'easy if' node handles conditional logic by evaluating the 'if' condition. If the condition is true, it executes the corresponding path; otherwise, it executes the alternative specified by 'else'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'easy if' node belong to?",
        "answer": "The 'easy if' node belongs to the category 'EasyUse/Logic/Math' within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the 'easy if' node execute different operations based on conditions?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'easy if' node can execute different operations based on specified conditions provided through its inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what infra type is the 'easy if' node commonly used?",
        "answer": "The 'easy if' node is commonly used in infra type 'CPU' within ComfyUI."
