        "question": "What is the LLMJsonComposer node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The LLMJsonComposer node is designed to generate valid JSON objects from given text inputs by leveraging a language model, accurately and coherently encapsulating the provided information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does LLMJsonComposer require to generate a JSON object?",
        "answer": "LLMJsonComposer requires a language model specified by `llm_model`, primary textual data through `text_input`, and a comma-separated list of classifiers through `classifier_list`, all crucial for interpreting and structuring the JSON output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `llm_model` input contribute to the JSON generation process in LLMJsonComposer?",
        "answer": "The `llm_model` input in LLMJsonComposer specifies the language model to be used for generating the JSON object. It plays a crucial role in interpreting the input text and classifiers to produce the structured JSON output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do `classifier_list` inputs have in LLMJsonComposer?",
        "answer": "The `classifier_list` inputs guide the JSON composition in LLMJsonComposer by categorizing the input text, which influences the structure and content of the generated JSON, ensuring it accurately represents the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LLMJsonComposer handle the `extra_directions` input?",
        "answer": "LLMJsonComposer allows for more tailored and specific JSON outputs through its optional `extra_directions` input, which provides additional instructions for the language model to follow when composing the JSON."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of LLMJsonComposer and in what format is it provided?",
        "answer": "The output of LLMJsonComposer is a `json_output` that is provided as a string in a structured and valid JSON format, representing the input text and classifiers processed by the language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is recommended for running LLMJsonComposer?",
        "answer": "LLMJsonComposer recommends using a GPU for its infra type, which can potentially provide the necessary computing resources for processing the textual data into JSON format."
