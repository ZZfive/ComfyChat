        "question": "What is the Mask To Image (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask To Image (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used to transform a mask into an RGB image, converting binary or grayscale mask data into a three-channel visual color image representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Mask To Image (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask To Image (mtb) node belongs to the category `mtb/generate` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for the Mask To Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Mask To Image (mtb) node requires `mask`, `color`, and `background` inputs to function correctly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Mask To Image (mtb) node handle the mask transformation into an RGB image?",
        "answer": "The Mask To Image (mtb) node expands the single channel of the mask into a three-channel RGB format to visualize the mask as a color image, enhancing its interpretability."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which data types are associated with the `mask`, `color`, and `background` inputs of the Mask To Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input is of type `MASK` (torch.Tensor), the `color` and `background` inputs are of type `COLOR` (str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types and format of the Mask To Image (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Mask To Image (mtb) node is defined as `IMAGE` (torch.Tensor), representing the RGB image generated from the input mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes are typically paired with the Mask To Image (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify any common nodes typically paired with the Mask To Image (mtb) node. It only mentions that its common nodes are unknown."
