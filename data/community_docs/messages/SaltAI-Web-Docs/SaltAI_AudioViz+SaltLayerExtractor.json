        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltLayerExtractor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltLayerExtractor node in ComfyUI is designed to extract specific layer data from a set of animation layers, focusing on parallax motion scheduling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does SaltLayerExtractor belong to?",
        "answer": "SaltLayerExtractor belongs to the category `SALT/Scheduling/Parallax Motion`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the index of the animation layer that SaltLayerExtractor extracts data from?",
        "answer": "The `layer_index` input specifies which layer's data to extract from the provided list of animation layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltLayerExtractor node output in terms of data types?",
        "answer": "The SaltLayerExtractor node outputs three lists: `zoom_schedule_list`, `x_schedule_list`, and `y_schedule_list`, representing schedules for zoom, x, and y values, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the name of the class in the source code for the SaltLayerExtractor?",
        "answer": "The class name for the SaltLayerExtractor node in ComfyUI is `SaltLayerExtractor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SaltLayerExtractor handle an index that is out of range of the provided animation layers?",
        "answer": "If the `layer_index` is out of range of the provided animation layers, SaltLayerExtractor raises a ValueError."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SaltLayerExtractor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SaltLayerExtractor are `float_layers` (a list of animation layers) and `layer_index` (an index specifying which layer's data to extract)."
