        "question": "What is ADE_SigmaSchedule in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaSchedule is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to generate a sigma schedule based on a given beta schedule, offering a straightforward way to obtain a sigma schedule for specific model sampling types and configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is a sigma schedule object, which is essential for defining the progression of noise levels in diffusion-based generative models. The comfy dtype is SIGMA_SCHEDULE."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `beta_schedule` parameter input to ADE_SigmaSchedule represent?",
        "answer": "The `beta_schedule` parameter input to ADE_SigmaSchedule specifies the beta schedule to be used for generating the sigma schedule. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base configuration from which the sigma schedule will be derived."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node abstracts the complexity of sigma schedule creation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_SigmaSchedule node abstracts the complexity of sigma schedule creation in ComfyUI, offering a straightforward way to obtain a sigma schedule tailored to specific model sampling types and configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of model sampling does the ADE_SigmaSchedule use by default?",
        "answer": "By default, the ADE_SigmaSchedule uses the Epsilon (EPS) model type for model sampling as defined by the ModelSamplingType enum."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the sigma schedule object from the ADE_SigmaSchedule node used in diffusion-based generative models?",
        "answer": "The sigma schedule object from the ADE_SigmaSchedule node is used in diffusion-based generative models to define the progression of noise levels. This is crucial for controlling the denoising process during image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What package does the Python dtype for the `sigma_schedule` output of ADE_SigmaSchedule come from?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `sigma_schedule` output of ADE_SigmaSchedule comes from the `animatediff` package, specifically the `SigmaSchedule` custom type."
