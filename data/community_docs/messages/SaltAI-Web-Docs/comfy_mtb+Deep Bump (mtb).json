        "question": "What is the Deep Bump (mtb) node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Deep Bump (mtb) node is designed for generating normal and height maps from single images, offering a versatile approach to texture processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Deep Bump (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Deep Bump (mtb) node is an IMAGE, which represents the processed texture of the input image, either as a normal map, curvature map, or height map."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in Deep Bump (mtb) determines the operation mode of converting images to different maps?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input type in Deep Bump (mtb) determines the operation mode of converting images to different maps, which can be converting color images to normal maps, normal maps to curvature maps, or normal maps to height maps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'color_to_normals_overlap' input in Deep Bump (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'color_to_normals_overlap' input in Deep Bump (mtb) determines the overlap size when converting color images to normal maps, influencing the smoothness and continuity of the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'normals_to_curvature_blur_radius' parameter affect the output of Deep Bump (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'normals_to_curvature_blur_radius' parameter in Deep Bump (mtb) specifies the blur radius when converting normal maps to curvature maps, affecting the level of detail and smoothness in the curvature map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'normals_to_height_seamless' parameter in Deep Bump (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'normals_to_height_seamless' parameter in Deep Bump (mtb) is a boolean indicating whether the conversion from normal maps to height maps should be seamless, impacting the continuity and uniformity of the height map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing does the Deep Bump (mtb) node perform?",
        "answer": "The Deep Bump (mtb) node performs advanced image processing techniques to generate detailed and accurate representations of surface textures from single images."
