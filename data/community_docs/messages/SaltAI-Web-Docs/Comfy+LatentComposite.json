        "question": "What is LatentComposite?",
        "answer": "LatentComposite is a class in ComfyUI designed for blending or merging two latent representations into a single output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for LatentComposite?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentComposite include 'samples_to', 'samples_from', 'x', 'y', and 'feather'. Each serves a specific role in the blending process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentComposite blend two latent representations?",
        "answer": "LatentComposite blends two latent representations by compositing 'samples_from' onto 'samples_to' at specified coordinates (x, y). It optionally resizes 'samples_from' based on the 'feather' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of LatentComposite?",
        "answer": "The output type of LatentComposite is a composite latent representation ('latent')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'feather' parameter in LatentComposite?",
        "answer": "The 'feather' parameter in LatentComposite determines whether 'samples_from' should be resized to match 'samples_to' before compositing. It affects the scale and proportion of the composite result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentComposite handle the compositing operation?",
        "answer": "LatentComposite handles the compositing operation by copying 'samples_to', applying 'samples_from' onto it at specified coordinates (x, y), and optionally feathering the edges based on the 'feather' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes related to LatentComposite?",
        "answer": "Common nodes related to LatentComposite include KSampler."
