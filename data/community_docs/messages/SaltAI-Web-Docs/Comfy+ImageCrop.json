        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageCrop node?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop node is designed for cropping images to a specified width and height starting from a given x and y coordinate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageCrop node?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop node requires inputs such as 'image', 'width', 'height', 'x', and 'y'. These parameters define the source image and the dimensions and coordinates for cropping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' parameter specify in the ImageCrop node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' parameter in the ImageCrop node specifies how wide the resulting cropped image will be."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageCrop node determine the starting point for cropping?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop node uses the 'x' and 'y' parameters to determine the top-left corner of the cropping area on the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the ImageCrop node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop node outputs a cropped image as a tensor of type 'IMAGE', which is suitable for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImageCrop node belong to?",
        "answer": "The ImageCrop node belongs to the category 'image/transform'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the ImageCrop class in the source code?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the ImageCrop class provides a method 'crop' that performs the actual cropping operation on the input image based on specified parameters."
