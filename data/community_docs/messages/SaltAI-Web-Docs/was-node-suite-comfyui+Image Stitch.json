        "question": "What node is designed to seamlessly combine two images together along a specified edge?",
        "answer": "The Image Stitch node is designed to seamlessly combine two images together along a specified edge (top, left, bottom, right) with an option for feathering to blend the images smoothly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the input `image_a` in the Image Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input `image_a` in the Image Stitch node is `IMAGE`, and the Python dtype is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the second image combined with the first image in the Image Stitch node?",
        "answer": "The second image is combined with the first image along a specified edge which can be 'top', 'left', 'bottom', or 'right'."

    {
        "question": "What does the `feathering` parameter in the Image Stitch node control?",
        "answer": "The `feathering` parameter in the Image Stitch node determines the amount of feathering applied to the edge where the images are stitched together, allowing for a smoother transition between the two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the Image Stitch node after stitching the input images?",
        "answer": "The Image Stitch node returns the resulting image after stitching the two input images together along the specified edge with optional feathering."
