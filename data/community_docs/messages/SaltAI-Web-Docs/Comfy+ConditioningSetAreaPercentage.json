    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by ConditioningSetAreaPercentage?",
        "answer": "The input types required by ConditioningSetAreaPercentage include 'conditioning', 'width', 'height', 'x', 'y', and 'strength'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ConditioningSetAreaPercentage modulate the intensity of conditioning effects?",
        "answer": "ConditioningSetAreaPercentage modulates the intensity of conditioning effects using a 'strength' parameter, which ranges from subtle to strong influences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'append' function in ConditioningSetAreaPercentage class do?",
        "answer": "The 'append' function in the ConditioningSetAreaPercentage class modifies the conditioning by setting values based on the specified area and strength parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'RETURN_TYPES' attribute of ConditioningSetAreaPercentage specify?",
        "answer": "The 'RETURN_TYPES' attribute of ConditioningSetAreaPercentage specifies that the function returns a tuple of type 'CONDITIONING'."
