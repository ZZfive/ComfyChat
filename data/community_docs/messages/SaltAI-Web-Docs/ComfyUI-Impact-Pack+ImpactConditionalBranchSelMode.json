    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node belongs to the `ImpactPack/Logic` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `cond` input represent in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node?",
        "answer": "The `cond` input represents a boolean condition that determines the branch of execution in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the `sel_mode` input in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node and what do they signify?",
        "answer": "The `sel_mode` input can be `True` or `False` in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node. `True` signifies selection is made on prompt, while `False` signifies selection is made on execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameters in the ImpactConditionalBranchSelMode node are optional and what are their functions?",
