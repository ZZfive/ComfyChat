        "question": "What is the BNK_SlerpLatent node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The BNK_SlerpLatent node in ComfyUI performs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) between two latent spaces, enabling smooth transitions between different latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the progress of interpolation in the BNK_SlerpLatent node?",
        "answer": "The progress of interpolation in the BNK_SlerpLatent node is determined by a scalar factor. A factor of 0 returns the first latent space, while a factor of 1 returns the second."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the BNK_SlerpLatent node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the BNK_SlerpLatent node are `latents1`, which is the first set of latent representations serving as the starting point for interpolation, and `factor`, a scalar determining the interpolation's progress."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the BNK_SlerpLatent node selectively interpolate parts of the latent spaces?",
        "answer": "Yes, the BNK_SlerpLatent node can selectively interpolate parts of the latent spaces using an optional mask input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BNK_SlerpLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output of the BNK_SlerpLatent node is an interpolated latent representation that smoothly blends between the two input latent spaces according to the specified factor and optional mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure does the BNK_SlerpLatent node require?",
        "answer": "The BNK_SlerpLatent node is designed to run on GPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `mask` input used in the BNK_SlerpLatent node?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input in the BNK_SlerpLatent node is used to selectively apply the interpolation by blending the latent spaces based on the mask's pattern."
