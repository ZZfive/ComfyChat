        "question": "What does the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node in ComfyUI calculate?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Aspect Ratio' node in ComfyUI calculates the aspect ratio of an image, determining whether it is landscape, portrait, or square based on its width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for 'Image Aspect Ratio' to perform its calculation?",
        "answer": "For the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node to calculate the aspect ratio, either an image tensor needs to be provided or the width and height must be specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input represent in the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node represents the image tensor for which the aspect ratio is to be calculated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' input in the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node signify?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in 'Image Aspect Ratio' signifies the width of the image, which is required if the image tensor is not provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node be used without an image tensor if width and height are specified?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'Image Aspect Ratio' node can be used without an image tensor if the width and height of the image are specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'is_landscape_bool' output convey?",
        "answer": "The 'is_landscape_bool' output of 'Image Aspect Ratio' is a boolean that indicates whether the image is in landscape orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is commonly paired with 'Image Aspect Ratio' for image processing?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Input Switch' node is commonly paired with 'Image Aspect Ratio' for image processing tasks within ComfyUI."
