        "question": "What class in the InspirePack/Util category helps maintain a count associated with a unique identifier?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter __Inspire class in the InspirePack/Util category is designed to maintain and increment a count associated with a unique identifier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the ListCounter __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter __Inspire node in ComfyUI is intended to track occurrences or iterations of specific actions or items within a list by maintaining and incrementing a count associated with a unique identifier."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input types does the ListCounter __Inspire node require for its operation?",
        "answer": "The ListCounter __Inspire node requires the input types `signal` and `base_value` for its operation. The `signal` acts as a trigger to increment the count, while `base_value` sets the starting point for the count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is the `signal` input in the ListCounter __Inspire node expected to handle?",
        "answer": "The `signal` input in the ListCounter __Inspire node is expected to handle data of the type `Any`, as it is designed to act as a trigger for the counting operation regardless of the data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ListCounter __Inspire node adjust its count after incrementation?",
        "answer": "After incrementation, the ListCounter __Inspire node adjusts its count by returning the current count, which is then adjusted by the base value that was initially input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the ListCounter __Inspire node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ListCounter __Inspire node is of type `int`, representing the current count after incrementation and adjustment by the base value."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the ListCounter __Inspire source code, what does the FUNCTION specify?",
        "answer": "In the context of the ListCounter __Inspire source code, the FUNCTION `doit` specifies the method that performs the count incrementation and adjustment by the base value."
