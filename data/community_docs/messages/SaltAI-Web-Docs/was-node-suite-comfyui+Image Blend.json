        "question": "What does the Image Blend node do?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend node is designed to seamlessly blend two images together based on a specified blend percentage, allowing for the creation of composite images by adjusting the degree of visibility of each input image in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Blend node are 'image_a', 'image_b', and 'blend_percentage'. 'image_a' and 'image_b' are of type PIL.Image, and 'blend_percentage' is a float that determines the blending ratio between the two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of 'blend_percentage' in the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "'blend_percentage' is a float value that determines the blending ratio between 'image_a' and 'image_b'. A higher percentage increases the visibility of 'image_b' in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Image Blend node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend node belongs to the category 'WAS Suite/Image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Blend node process the images?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend node converts the input images to PIL format, creates a blend mask based on the 'blend_percentage', and then uses the mask to composite the two images, resulting in the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to create composite images by adjusting the degree of visibility of each image?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend node can be used to create composite images by adjusting the degree of visibility of each input image in the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Blend node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Blend node is a single image that is the result of blending 'image_a' and 'image_b' according to the specified blend percentage. The output image is of type IMAGE in ComfyUI and PIL.Image in Python."
