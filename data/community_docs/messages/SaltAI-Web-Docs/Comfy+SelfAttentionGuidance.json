        "question": "What is SelfAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "SelfAttentionGuidance is a node in ComfyUI designed to modify the attention mechanism within a model to enhance its focus on specific aspects of input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SelfAttentionGuidance node do?",
        "answer": "The SelfAttentionGuidance node guides the self-attention process in a model, potentially improving its performance and interpretability."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SelfAttentionGuidance achieve enhanced focus?",
        "answer": "SelfAttentionGuidance achieves enhanced focus by modifying the attention mechanism within a model, directing it towards specific aspects of the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for SelfAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SelfAttentionGuidance include 'model', 'scale', and 'blur_sigma'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'model' input in SelfAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in SelfAttentionGuidance represents the neural network model that will be modified by the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SelfAttentionGuidance modify the 'model' input?",
        "answer": "SelfAttentionGuidance modifies the 'model' input by adjusting its self-attention mechanism based on the provided guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'scale' input used for in SelfAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' input in SelfAttentionGuidance is used for adjusting the amount of influence the guidance has on the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of 'blur_sigma' in SelfAttentionGuidance?",
        "answer": "'blur_sigma' in SelfAttentionGuidance controls the amount of blur applied during the guidance process."
