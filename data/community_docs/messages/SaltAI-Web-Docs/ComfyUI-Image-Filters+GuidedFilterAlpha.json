        "question": "What is the GuidedFilterAlpha node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GuidedFilterAlpha node in ComfyUI is used to apply a guided filter to images using a specified alpha channel and filter parameters. This process enhances the image by smoothing while preserving edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the GuidedFilterAlpha node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the GuidedFilterAlpha node in ComfyUI is `GuidedFilterAlpha`."
    },
    {
        "question": "List the required input types for the GuidedFilterAlpha node.",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GuidedFilterAlpha node include `images` of type `IMAGE`, `alpha` of type `IMAGE`, `filter_radius` of type `INT`, and `sigma` of type `FLOAT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` input represent in the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The `images` input in the GuidedFilterAlpha node represents the input images to be filtered, where the alpha channel guides the filtering process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the role of the `alpha` input in the GuidedFilterAlpha node.",
        "answer": "The `alpha` input in the GuidedFilterAlpha node is the alpha channel used to guide the filtering process, influencing how the image details are blended and preserved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `filter_radius` input in the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The `filter_radius` input in the GuidedFilterAlpha node specifies the radius of the filter, affecting the extent of smoothing and edge preservation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `sigma` parameter influence the output of the GuidedFilterAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The `sigma` parameter in the GuidedFilterAlpha node controls the degree of smoothing; higher values result in more blur."
