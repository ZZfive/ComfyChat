        "question": "What is the FloatRange __Inspire node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange __Inspire node in ComfyUI is used to generate a sequence of floating-point numbers, starting from a specified value, stopping at another, and incrementing by a defined step, providing precision control over the range of values."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the FloatRange __Inspire node, what does the 'start' input control?",
        "answer": "The 'start' input in the FloatRange __Inspire node defines the starting point of the range, setting the initial value from which the sequence of floating-point numbers begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines if the 'stop' value is included in the range generated by the FloatRange __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The inclusion of the 'stop' value in the range generated by the FloatRange __Inspire node is determined by the 'ensure_end' input flag; when enabled, it ensures that the stopping value is included in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'step' input in FloatRange __Inspire affect the generated sequence?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input in the FloatRange __Inspire node determines the increment between each number in the sequence, allowing for fine-grained control over the progression and precision of the generated floating-point range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the FloatRange __Inspire node output?",
        "answer": "The FloatRange __Inspire node outputs a list of floating-point numbers that constitute the generated range. This output is structured as a list of 'float' types to represent the sequence of numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'ensure_end' parameter in the FloatRange __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'ensure_end' parameter in the FloatRange __Inspire node, when enabled, adjusts the sequence if necessary to ensure that the stopping value is included in the generated range of floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'limit' input in the FloatRange __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The 'limit' input in the FloatRange __Inspire node is used to restrict the number of elements in the generated sequence, preventing the output from being excessively large and causing performance issues."
