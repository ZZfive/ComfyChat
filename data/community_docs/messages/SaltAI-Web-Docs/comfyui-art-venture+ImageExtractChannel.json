        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageExtractChannel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageExtractChannel node in ComfyUI is designed to extract a specific channel (Red, Green, Blue, or Alpha) from a given set of images, facilitating individual color channel manipulation and analysis for various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which color channels can be extracted using the ImageExtractChannel node?",
        "answer": "The ImageExtractChannel node allows for the extraction of Red, Green, Blue, or Alpha channels from images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the expected input type for the 'images' parameter in the ImageExtractChannel node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the ImageExtractChannel node expects input of type IMAGE, which is represented as a torch.Tensor in Python, serving as the images from which a specific channel will be extracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'channel_data' output from the ImageExtractChannel node represented?",
        "answer": "The 'channel_data' output from the ImageExtractChannel node is represented as a MASK in ComfyUI, and as a torch.Tensor in Python, containing the extracted channel data from the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the ImageExtractChannel node, what does the 'channel' input represent?",
        "answer": "The 'channel' input in the ImageExtractChannel node represents the selection of the color channel (Red, Green, Blue, or Alpha) to be extracted from the images, specified as a COMBO[STRING] type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageExtractChannel node?",
        "answer": "The ImageExtractChannel node requires two inputs: 'images' of type IMAGE (torch.Tensor) and 'channel' of type COMBO[STRING], specifying the images from which to extract a specific channel and the particular color channel to be isolated, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type provided by the ImageExtractChannel node in terms of ComfyUI and Python data types?",
        "answer": "The ImageExtractChannel node outputs 'channel_data', which is of type MASK in ComfyUI, corresponding to a torch.Tensor in Python, containing the extracted channel data from the input images."
