        "question": "What is the SamplerLCMCycle node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLCMCycle node in ComfyUI is used for generating a custom sampler based on the LCM cycle method, incorporating options for Euler steps, LCM steps, sigma tweaking, and ancestral sampling to tailor the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'euler_steps' specify in the SamplerLCMCycle node?",
        "answer": "The 'euler_steps' parameter in the SamplerLCMCycle node specifies the number of Euler steps to be used in the LCM cycle, affecting the granularity of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do 'lcm_steps' affect the sampling process in the SamplerLCMCycle node?",
        "answer": "The 'lcm_steps' parameter in the SamplerLCMCycle node determines the number of LCM steps in the cycle, influencing the sampling's adherence to the LCM pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'tweak_sigmas' flag in the SamplerLCMCycle node?",
        "answer": "The 'tweak_sigmas' flag in the SamplerLCMCycle node, when enabled, tweaks the sigma values used in the sampling process for potentially enhanced results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is controlled by the 'ancestral' input in the SamplerLCMCycle node?",
        "answer": "The 'ancestral' input in the SamplerLCMCycle node controls the ancestral sampling rate, offering a way to adjust the influence of previous generations on the current sample."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SamplerLCMCycle node produce?",
        "answer": "The SamplerLCMCycle node produces a custom sampler configured according to the specified LCM cycle parameters, with the output type being SAMPLER."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sampler' output in the SamplerLCMCycle node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler' output in the SamplerLCMCycle node represents a custom sampler configured according to the specified LCM cycle parameters, with the Python dtype being comfy.samplers.KSAMPLER."
