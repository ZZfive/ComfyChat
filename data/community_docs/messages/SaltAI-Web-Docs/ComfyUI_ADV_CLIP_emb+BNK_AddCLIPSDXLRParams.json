        "question": "What is the purpose of the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance the conditioning data for image generation by incorporating additional parameters such as width, height, and an aesthetic score."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node add to the conditioning elements for more tailored image generation?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node adds specified dimensions like width and height, along with an aesthetic score, to each conditioning element to prepare data for more tailored and aesthetically pleasing image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the width to be added to the conditioning data in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node?",
        "answer": "The width input specifies the width to be added to the conditioning data, influencing the dimensions of the generated image in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the inferred type of the 'height' input in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node?",
        "answer": "The height input in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node has a Comfy dtype of INT and a Python dtype of int, specifying the height to be added to the conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'ascore' input in BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'ascore' input in BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams, which is the aesthetic score to guide image generation towards visually appealing results, is 6.0."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'conditioning' output of the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' output of the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node represents the enhanced conditioning data, now including specified width, height, and aesthetic score, for each element."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operations can the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node perform on the input 'conditioning' data?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLRParams node can iterate over a list of conditioning elements, modifying each with specified dimensions and an aesthetic score by adding the width, height, and ascore to each element."
