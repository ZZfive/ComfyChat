        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node is designed to colorize specific facial parts in pose keypoint data, using customizable colors for each facial part, to visually enhance and distinguish different facial regions based on the provided keypoint data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node include `pose_kps` (pose keypoint data), `mode` (drawing mode for keypoints), `skin`, `left_eye`, `right_eye`, `nose`, `upper_lip`, `inner_mouth`, and `lower_lip` (colors for corresponding facial parts)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `pose_kps` input represent in the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The `pose_kps` input represents the pose keypoint data containing information about the positions of various facial parts, which serves as the primary input for generating colorized facial keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `mode` input in the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node specifies the drawing mode for keypoints, allowing for either point-based or polygon-based rendering of facial parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node is a tensor representation of the pose frames with facial parts colorized according to the specified colors, with the Comfy dtype of `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which facial parts can be colorized using the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node can colorize the skin, left eye, right eye, nose, upper lip, inner mouth, and lower lip of the facial parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the drawing mode specified by the `mode` input in the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node capable of?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in the Inference_Core_FacialPartColoringFromPoseKps node is capable of either point-based or polygon-based rendering of facial parts, depending on the selected mode."
