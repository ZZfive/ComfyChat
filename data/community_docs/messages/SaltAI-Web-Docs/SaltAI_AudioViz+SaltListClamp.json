        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltListClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltListClamp node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the values in a given list to ensure they fall within a specified minimum and maximum range, maintaining the integrity of data by preventing values from exceeding predetermined bounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltListClamp node are `schedule_list` of Comfy dtype `LIST` and Python dtype `List[float]`, `min_value` of Comfy dtype `FLOAT` and Python dtype `float`, and `max_value` of Comfy dtype `FLOAT` and Python dtype `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltListClamp node output?",
        "answer": "The SaltListClamp node outputs a clamped list of Comfy dtype `LIST` and Python dtype `List[float]`, where all values are adjusted to fall within the specified minimum and maximum bounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaltListClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltListClamp node falls under the category `SALT/Scheduling/Filter` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What error will be raised if the `min_value` is greater than the `max_value` in the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "If the `min_value` is greater than the `max_value`, the SaltListClamp node will raise a `ValueError` with the message 'Schedules min_value cannot be greater than max_value.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of node in ComfyUI is used for clamping values within a specified range?",
        "answer": "The SaltListClamp node is used in ComfyUI for clamping values within a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the clamping process implemented in the SaltListClamp node?",
        "answer": "The clamping process in the SaltListClamp node is implemented by applying the `max` and `min` functions to each value in the `schedule_list`, ensuring it does not exceed the `max_value` or fall below the `min_value`."
