    {
        "question": "What does the `ipadapter` input parameter in the IPAdapterEncoder node represent?",
        "answer": "The `ipadapter` input parameter in the IPAdapterEncoder node represents the IPAdapter instance used for encoding, which determines the specific adaptation techniques applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter of IPAdapterEncoder influences the fine-tuning of the adaptation effects on the image?",
        "answer": "The `weight` input parameter of IPAdapterEncoder influences the fine-tuning of the adaptation effects on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can IPAdapterEncoder selectively encode certain image regions?",
        "answer": "Yes, IPAdapterEncoder can selectively encode certain image regions by applying the `mask` optional input parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IPAdapterEncoder node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output types of the IPAdapterEncoder node in ComfyUI are `pos_embed` and `neg_embed`, both of which are of the type `EMBEDS`."
