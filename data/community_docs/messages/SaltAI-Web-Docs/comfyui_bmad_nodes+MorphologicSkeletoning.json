        "question": "What is the MorphologicSkeletoning node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MorphologicSkeletoning node in ComfyUI is designed for computing the morphological skeleton of an image, transforming it into a minimal, yet fully representative, skeletal form that retains the structure and connectivity of the original shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the MorphologicSkeletoning node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the MorphologicSkeletoning node is `MorphologicSkeletoning`."
    },

    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'src' input in the MorphologicSkeletoning node?",
        "answer": "The 'src' input in the MorphologicSkeletoning node has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MorphologicSkeletoning node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MorphologicSkeletoning node is a skeletal representation of the input image, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`, preserving the structure and connectivity of the original shape in a minimal form."
