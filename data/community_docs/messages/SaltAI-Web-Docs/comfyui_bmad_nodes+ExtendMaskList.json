        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendMaskList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendMaskList node in ComfyUI is designed to extend a list of masks, allowing for the aggregation of multiple mask elements into a single, comprehensive list. This is useful for operations that require handling multiple masks simultaneously."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ExtendMaskList belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ExtendMaskList belongs to the 'Bmad/Lists/Extend' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is ExtendMaskList an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, ExtendMaskList is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'inputs_len' parameter for in ExtendMaskList?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in ExtendMaskList represents the collection of mask elements to be extended. It is the primary data input for the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does 'inputs_len' accept in ExtendMaskList?",
        "answer": "'inputs_len' in ExtendMaskList accepts Comfy dtype as 'INT' and Python dtype as 'List[torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ExtendMaskList node output?",
        "answer": "The ExtendMaskList node outputs an extended list of mask elements, consolidated into a single entity. The output is categorized under the Comfy dtype 'MASK' and the Python dtype 'List[torch.Tensor]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing is ExtendMaskList optimized for?",
        "answer": "ExtendMaskList is optimized for CPU processing."
