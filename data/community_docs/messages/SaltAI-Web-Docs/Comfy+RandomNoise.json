        "question": "What is RandomNoise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "RandomNoise is a custom node in ComfyUI that generates random noise based on a specified seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'noise_seed' parameter play in RandomNoise?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_seed' parameter in RandomNoise specifies the seed for random noise generation, ensuring consistency and reproducibility of the noise pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does RandomNoise contribute to introducing variability?",
        "answer": "RandomNoise introduces variability by providing a randomized element that can be consistently reproduced using the seed value, thereby influencing processes with a random component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of RandomNoise?",
        "answer": "The output types of RandomNoise include 'noise', which represents the generated random noise as a tuple, suitable for introducing randomness into various processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of RandomNoise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "RandomNoise belongs to the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/noise' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type associated with RandomNoise?",
        "answer": "The Infra type associated with RandomNoise is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain how the RandomNoise node is used?",
        "answer": "The RandomNoise node is used to generate random noise based on a given seed, which can be utilized to introduce variability into processes such as image generation or sampling."
