        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactLatentInfo node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLatentInfo node in ComfyUI is designed to process latent representations by analyzing their shape and dimensions, providing a straightforward interface for extracting critical dimensional information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' parameter represent in the ImpactLatentInfo node?",
        "answer": "The 'value' parameter in the ImpactLatentInfo node represents the latent representation to be analyzed. It is crucial for determining the shape and dimensions of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImpactLatentInfo node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the ImpactLatentInfo node include 'batch', 'height', 'width', and 'channel'. These represent the batch size, the modified height dimension, the modified width dimension, and the channel dimension of the input latent representation, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can the ImpactLatentInfo node be found in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLatentInfo node can be found in the 'ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test' category in ComfyUI's node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactLatentInfo node determine the dimensions of the latent representation?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLatentInfo node determines the dimensions of the latent representation by examining the shape of the latent sample. It returns the batch size, the modified height dimension, the modified width dimension, and the channel dimension as output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly associated with the ImpactLatentInfo node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify any commonly associated nodes for the ImpactLatentInfo node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the ImpactLatentInfo node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLatentInfo node is optimized for CPU infrastructure."
