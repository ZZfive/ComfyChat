        "question": "What does the OffsetImage node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The OffsetImage node in ComfyUI is designed to shift an image by a specified percentage of its width and height, creating a seamless tiling effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters are required by the OffsetImage node?",
        "answer": "The OffsetImage node requires an input image (`pixels`), and two percentages (`x_percent` and `y_percent`) specifying the horizontal and vertical shift of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the OffsetImage node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OffsetImage node belongs to the 'image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `pixels` input parameter accept in the OffsetImage node?",
        "answer": "The `pixels` input parameter in the OffsetImage node accepts a `torch.Tensor` data type in Python, corresponding to the `IMAGE` type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the OffsetImage node?",
        "answer": "The output of the OffsetImage node is a modified image (`image`), which is a `torch.Tensor` in Python and corresponds to the `IMAGE` type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type supports the execution of the OffsetImage node?",
        "answer": "The OffsetImage node is supported on a GPU infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the shift amounts determined in the OffsetImage node?",
        "answer": "The shift amounts in the OffsetImage node are determined by the `x_percent` and `y_percent` parameters, which specify the percentage of the image's width and height by which the image should be shifted horizontally and vertically, respectively."
