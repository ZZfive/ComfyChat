        "question": "What is CLIPMergeAdd?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeAdd is a node in ComfyUI designed for combining two CLIP model instances by adding key patches from one model to another."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of CLIPMergeAdd?",
        "answer": "The purpose of CLIPMergeAdd is to enhance or modify the capabilities of the first CLIP model by incorporating key patches from a second CLIP model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for CLIPMergeAdd?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CLIPMergeAdd are 'clip1' and 'clip2', both of type CLIP. 'clip1' serves as the base model, while 'clip2' provides patches to be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CLIPMergeAdd?",
        "answer": "The output type of CLIPMergeAdd is a CLIP model ('clip') that incorporates the added patches from 'clip2' into 'clip1'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CLIPMergeAdd handle model merging?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeAdd merges models by adding key patches from 'clip2' to 'clip1', using a process that enhances or modifies the capabilities of 'clip1' without altering specific positional or scaling parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of CLIPMergeAdd?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeAdd belongs to the category 'advanced/model_merging' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CLIPMergeAdd contribute to model enhancement?",
        "answer": "CLIPMergeAdd contributes to model enhancement by selectively adding key patches from one CLIP model to another, thereby modifying and enhancing the capabilities of the base model."
