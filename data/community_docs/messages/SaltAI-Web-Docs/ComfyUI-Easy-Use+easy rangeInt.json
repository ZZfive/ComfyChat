        "question": "What is the `easy rangeInt` class used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy rangeInt` class in ComfyUI is used for generating a sequence of numbers, specifically integers, based on specified parameters such as start, stop, step, and number of steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `easy rangeInt` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `easy rangeInt` node include `range_mode`, `start`, `stop`, `step`, `num_steps`, and `end_mode`, which respectively determine the generation mode, starting and ending values, the increment, the total number of steps, and the inclusion of the stop value in the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `end_mode` parameter affect the output of the `easy rangeInt` node?",
        "answer": "The `end_mode` parameter in the `easy rangeInt` node affects the output by determining whether the ending value (`stop`) is included in or excluded from the generated range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data types are associated with the `easy rangeInt` node's inputs?",
        "answer": "The Python data types associated with the `easy rangeInt` node's inputs are `List[str]` for the combo string inputs like `range_mode` and `end_mode`, and `float` or `int` for the numerical inputs like `start`, `stop`, `step`, and `num_steps`, depending on the input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `easy rangeInt` node output?",
        "answer": "The `easy rangeInt` node outputs a tuple of lists, the first being `range` which is the generated sequence of numbers, and the second being `range_sizes` which indicates the size of the generated range."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are common in relation to the `easy rangeInt` node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify any common nodes related to the `easy rangeInt` node, indicating that information is not provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the `easy rangeInt` node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `easy rangeInt` node is classified in the 'EasyUse/Logic/Type' category within ComfyUI."
