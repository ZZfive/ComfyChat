        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node in WAS Suite/Conditioning?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncode (NSP) node is designed to encode text inputs using CLIP models, enhanced with Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP) or wildcard text transformations, aiming to provide versatile text encoding for text-to-image or conditioning applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mode` input in CLIPTextEncode (NSP) determine?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in CLIPTextEncode (NSP) determines whether the text transformation will use Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcards, affecting how the text is parsed and encoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for customizing the prompt transformation process in CLIPTextEncode (NSP)?",
        "answer": "The `noodle_key` input is crucial for customizing the prompt transformation process in CLIPTextEncode (NSP), used in Noodle Soup Prompts for dynamic text replacement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `clip` input in CLIPTextEncode (NSP)?",
        "answer": "The `clip` input in CLIPTextEncode (NSP) represents the CLIP model that is used for encoding the text input, affecting the quality and relevance of the encoded output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output from CLIPTextEncode (NSP) provides the encoded text output suitable for text-to-image generation?",
        "answer": "The `conditioning` output from CLIPTextEncode (NSP) provides the encoded text output suitable for text-to-image generation or other conditioning contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `raw_text` output in CLIPTextEncode (NSP) represent?",
        "answer": "The `raw_text` output in CLIPTextEncode (NSP) represents the original text input before any Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcard transformation, allowing for comparison with the processed text."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which aspect does the `ui` output from CLIPTextEncode (NSP) enhance user interaction?",
        "answer": "The `ui` output from CLIPTextEncode (NSP) enhances user interaction by displaying the parsed text, showing how the input text was transformed after processing by NSP or wildcard transformation."
