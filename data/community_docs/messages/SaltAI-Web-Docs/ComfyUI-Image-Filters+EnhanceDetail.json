        "question": "What is the purpose of the EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI is designed to improve the visual quality of images by applying filters that enhance details, adjust sharpness, and potentially reduce noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the radius of the filter applied in EnhanceDetail?",
        "answer": "The parameter that controls the radius of the filter in EnhanceDetail is named `filter_radius`. A larger radius can lead to more pronounced detail enhancement but may also introduce increased processing time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `sigma` parameter affect the output of the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The `sigma` parameter in EnhanceDetail affects the degree of smoothing and detail preservation by controlling the sigma parameter of the guided filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes in ComfyUI are used to improve the detail of images?",
        "answer": "The EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI is specifically designed to improve the detail of images by applying a series of filters that enhance details and adjust sharpness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `denoise` parameter determine in the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The `denoise` parameter in EnhanceDetail determines the strength of the denoising filter, with a higher value capable of reducing noise but potentially decreasing the clarity of fine details."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, what is the output type of the EnhanceDetail node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the EnhanceDetail node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, representing the images after the detail enhancement process with potentially reduced noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter adjusts the intensity of the detail enhancement effect in EnhanceDetail?",
        "answer": "The `detail_mult` parameter in EnhanceDetail adjusts the intensity of the detail enhancement effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the enhancement's intensity."
