        "question": "What is ACN_ReferencePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "ACN_ReferencePreprocessor is a node in ComfyUI designed for preprocessing reference inputs for the Advanced ControlNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of ACN_ReferencePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "ACN_ReferencePreprocessor preprocesses reference inputs, transforming them into a format suitable for further manipulation and application within the Advanced ControlNet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ACN_ReferencePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "ACN_ReferencePreprocessor requires 'image', 'vae', and 'latent_size' as input types. 'image' is visual data to be processed, 'vae' is a variational autoencoder, and 'latent_size' specifies the dimensions of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ACN_ReferencePreprocessor handle the 'image' input?",
        "answer": "ACN_ReferencePreprocessor handles the 'image' input by resizing it to match the specified latent size and then encoding it using the variational autoencoder (vae)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ACN_ReferencePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The output type of ACN_ReferencePreprocessor is 'proc_IMAGE', which is a specialized latent representation intended for direct use with an Apply Advanced ControlNet node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'latent_size' parameter in ACN_ReferencePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'latent_size' parameter in ACN_ReferencePreprocessor is 'Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category under which ACN_ReferencePreprocessor is classified?",
        "answer": "ACN_ReferencePreprocessor is classified under the category 'Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/Reference/preprocess'."
