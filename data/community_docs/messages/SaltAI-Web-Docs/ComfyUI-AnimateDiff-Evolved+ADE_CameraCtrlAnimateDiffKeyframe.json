    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_percent' input in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' input in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node specifies the starting point of the animation as a percentage, allowing for precise control over the timing of camera movements and effects within the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'start_percent' input expect?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' input expects a 'FLOAT' data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is missing data handled in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node's current keyframe?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node allows for the handling of missing data in the current keyframe by the 'inherit_missing' input, which determines whether missing values should be inherited from previous keyframes to ensure continuity in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'guarantee_steps' input in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'guarantee_steps' input in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node specifies the minimum number of steps to be guaranteed in the animation, ensuring a certain level of smoothness and continuity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for scaling effects in animations created with the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_multival' input is responsible for applying a scaling factor to the animation, enabling adjustments to the size of animated elements in the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of input that the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node supports?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node supports required and optional inputs. Required inputs include 'start_percent', while optional inputs include 'prev_ad_keyframes', 'scale_multival', 'effect_multival', 'cameractrl_multival', 'inherit_missing', and 'guarantee_steps'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node generate as output?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node generates a sequence of AnimateDiff keyframes as output, enabling the creation of animations with complex camera movements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is parallel processing supported for the ADE_CameraCtrlAnimateDiffKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not mention support for parallel processing. Given the node utilizes CPU for processing, it likely does not support concurrent execution."
