        "question": "What is the BatchStringSchedule node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchStringSchedule node in ComfyUI is used for processing animation prompts. It splits the prompts into positive and negative categories, interpolates these prompts over a series of frames, and returns the current and next prompts for both categories, facilitating dynamic text generation based on frame-specific settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' parameter represent in the BatchStringSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' parameter in the BatchStringSchedule node represents the animation prompts to be processed, serving as the input for splitting and interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchStringSchedule node handle the 'pre_text' and 'app_text' parameters?",
        "answer": "The 'pre_text' parameter in the BatchStringSchedule node is text that is prepended to each animation prompt before processing, whereas the 'app_text' parameter is text that is appended to each animation prompt after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'max_frames' parameter in the BatchStringSchedule node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' parameter in the BatchStringSchedule node specifies the maximum number of frames for which the animation prompts will be processed and interpolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is categorized under FizzNodes BatchScheduleNodes and deals with string interpolation for animation?",
        "answer": "The BatchStringSchedule node is categorized under FizzNodes BatchScheduleNodes and is designed to handle string interpolation for animation purposes in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the BatchStringSchedule node generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchStringSchedule node in ComfyUI generates two outputs: The current positive prompt (`POS`) and the current negative prompt (`NEG`), both interpolated for the current frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchStringSchedule node in ComfyUI manage its infrastructure for processing?",
        "answer": "The BatchStringSchedule node in ComfyUI manages its infrastructure as an infra type of `CPU`."
