        "question": "What is CM_BoolBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_BoolBinaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs binary operations on boolean values, facilitating the manipulation of boolean logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_BoolBinaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_BoolBinaryOperation belongs to the 'math/bool' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of CM_BoolBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output node of CM_BoolBinaryOperation is 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for CM_BoolBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_BoolBinaryOperation requires inputs 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' specifies the binary operation to perform, and 'a' and 'b' are boolean inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'op' input specify in CM_BoolBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "'op' in CM_BoolBinaryOperation specifies the binary operation to perform on boolean inputs, such as 'And', 'Or', 'Xor', etc."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_BoolBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_BoolBinaryOperation is boolean ('BOOL')."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_BoolBinaryOperation combine the boolean inputs?",
        "answer": "CM_BoolBinaryOperation combines the boolean inputs based on the specified binary operation ('op'). For example, 'And' combines inputs using logical AND."
