        "question": "What is the NormalMapSimple node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NormalMapSimple node in ComfyUI is designed to generate normal maps from images, applying a transformation that simulates the appearance of surface variations and depth based on lighting."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the NormalMapSimple node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NormalMapSimple node falls under the category 'image/filters' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'images' input in the NormalMapSimple node responsible for?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the NormalMapSimple node represents the source images for which normal maps are to be generated. It is crucial for determining the texture and depth information that will be transformed into a normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the 'scale_XY' parameter have on the generated normal maps?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_XY' parameter in the NormalMapSimple node adjusts the intensity of the surface variation effect in the generated normal map. A higher value increases the perceived depth by scaling the x and y components of the normal vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'images' input in the NormalMapSimple node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input in the NormalMapSimple node has a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the NormalMapSimple node produce?",
        "answer": "The NormalMapSimple node produces a torch.Tensor output with a dtype of 'IMAGE' in ComfyUI, which is a transformed version of the input images, represented as normal maps, encoding surface orientation and depth information to enhance the 3D appearance of 2D images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of hardware is recommended for the computation of the NormalMapSimple node?",
        "answer": "The NormalMapSimple node recommends using 'GPU' for computation as specified by the 'infra type'."
