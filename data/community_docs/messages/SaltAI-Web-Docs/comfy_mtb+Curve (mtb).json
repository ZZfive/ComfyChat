    {
        "question": "What is the 'curve' parameter in the Curve (mtb) node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'curve' parameter in the Curve (mtb) node represents the FLOAT_CURVE data to be processed, which is essential for the node's operation and directly influences its output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Curve (mtb) node process?",
        "answer": "The Curve (mtb) node processes FLOAT_CURVE data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Curve (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Curve (mtb) node is a `float_curve`, which is the processed or unaltered FLOAT_CURVE data, depending on the node's implementation and the input provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the curve data output represented in Python by the Curve (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The curve data output by the Curve (mtb) node is represented as a `dict` in Python, with the Comfy dtype being `FLOAT_CURVE`."
