        "question": "What is the purpose of the MiDaS Model Loader node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the MiDaS Model Loader node is to load and prepare the MiDaS model for depth estimation tasks. It handles the installation of necessary dependencies, model selection based on input, and the application of appropriate transformations for input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the MiDaS Model Loader node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the MiDaS Model Loader node are `midas_model` with comfortable dtype `MIDAS_MODEL`, which returns the loaded MiDaS model and the transformation function required for preparing input images for depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the choice of `midas_model` input affect the depth estimation?",
        "answer": "The choice of `midas_model` input affects the depth estimation accuracy and performance. It specifies the version of the MiDaS model to be loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `midas_model` output from the MiDaS Model Loader node contain?",
        "answer": "The `midas_model` output from the MiDaS Model Loader node contains the loaded MiDaS model and the transformation function required for preparing input images for depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the MiDaS Model Loader?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with the MiDaS Model Loader include the MiDaS Depth Approximation node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models can be specified through the `midas_model` input?",
        "answer": "The models that can be specified through the `midas_model` input include 'DPT_Large' and 'DPT_Hybrid'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the returned `midas_model` output include?",
        "answer": "The returned `midas_model` output includes a tuple where the first element is the MiDaS model loaded from either a file or downloaded, and the second element is the transformation function required for preparing input images for depth estimation."
