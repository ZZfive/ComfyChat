        "question": "What is the Image Compare (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Compare (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used for comparing two images using different modes such as checkerboard, diff, or blend, and returns a difference image that highlights the variations between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image Compare (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Compare (mtb) node belongs to the category 'mtb/image' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Image Compare (mtb) node return as an output?",
        "answer": "The Image Compare (mtb) node returns 'image' as its output, which is of dtype 'IMAGE' and represents the resulting image after comparison, highlighting differences based on the selected mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Compare (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Compare (mtb) node in ComfyUI are 'imageA', 'imageB', and 'mode'. 'imageA' and 'imageB' are the images to compare, while 'mode' specifies the method of comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'mode' input in the Image Compare (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input in the Image Compare (mtb) node specifies the method of comparison to apply. It can be one of the options: 'checkerboard', 'diff', or 'blend', influencing how the differences between the images are visualized."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which scenario would you use the 'diff' mode of the Image Compare (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'diff' mode of the Image Compare (mtb) node is used to visualize the actual differences between two images by creating a difference image that highlights the variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of the Image Compare (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node of the Image Compare (mtb) node in ComfyUI is 'False', indicating it operates as a node within the program and does not act as the final output node."
