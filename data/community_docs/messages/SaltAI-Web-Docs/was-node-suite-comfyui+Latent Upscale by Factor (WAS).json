        "question": "What is the purpose of the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node in ComfyUI is designed to upscale latent images by a specified factor, using various interpolation methods to improve resolution while preserving the original image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the interpolation methods available in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node offers 'area', 'bicubic', 'bilinear', and 'nearest' interpolation methods to upscale images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the scaling factor in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node determines the scaling factor by which the latent images will be upscaled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'samples' input in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node expect?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' input in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node expects latent images represented as `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'align' input in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node control?",
        "answer": "The 'align' input in the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node is a boolean flag that controls whether to align corners in certain interpolation modes, affecting upscaling precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node outputs upscaled latent images represented as `torch.Tensor` with the 'latent' output type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the infrastructure requirements for using the Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node?",
        "answer": "The Latent Upscale by Factor (WAS) node requires a GPU for optimal performance."
