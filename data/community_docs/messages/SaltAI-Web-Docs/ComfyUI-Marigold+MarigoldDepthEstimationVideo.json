        "question": "Which nodes allow for diffusion-based monocular depth estimation in video sequences?",
        "answer": "The MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node allows for diffusion-based monocular depth estimation in video sequences, incorporating optical flow for enhanced frame-to-frame consistency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does flow_warping play in the MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node?",
        "answer": "Enables or disables the use of optical flow for warping depth maps between frames, crucial for maintaining temporal consistency in videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does `invert` modify the output of the MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node?",
        "answer": "The `invert` property inverts the depth map's color scheme, where typically black represents the front and white the back."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `n_repeat_batch_size` in the MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node?",
        "answer": "The `n_repeat_batch_size` determines how many of the n_repeat iterations are processed together as a batch, influencing processing speed and VRAM usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of `flow_depth_mix` in the MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node?",
        "answer": "The `flow_depth_mix` parameter represents the mixing ratio between the current and previous depth maps, influenced by optical flow, to achieve temporal stability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `first_frame_n_repeat` control in the MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node?",
        "answer": "The `first_frame_n_repeat` control the number of iterations to be ensembled for the first frame's depth map, affecting the final depth estimation's accuracy and detail."
