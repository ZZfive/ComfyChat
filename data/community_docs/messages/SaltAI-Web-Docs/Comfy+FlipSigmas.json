        "question": "What is FlipSigmas?",
        "answer": "`FlipSigmas` is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for manipulating a sequence of sigma values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does FlipSigmas do with sigma values?",
        "answer": "`FlipSigmas` reverses the order of sigma values and ensures the first value is set to a minimal positive value if it was originally zero."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is FlipSigmas important in sampling processes?",
        "answer": "`FlipSigmas` is crucial in sampling processes because the order and values of sigma sequences can significantly affect the outcome of generative processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of FlipSigmas?",
        "answer": "The category of `FlipSigmas` is `sampling/custom_sampling/sigmas`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by FlipSigmas?",
        "answer": "The required input type for `FlipSigmas` is `sigmas`, which is a sequence of sigma values represented as a `SIGMAS` data type in ComfyUI and a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of FlipSigmas?",
        "answer": "The output type of `FlipSigmas` is also `sigmas`, represented as a `SIGMAS` data type in ComfyUI and a `torch.Tensor` in Python. The output is a sequence of sigma values with the order reversed and the first value adjusted to avoid being zero."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does FlipSigmas manipulate sigma values?",
        "answer": "`FlipSigmas` manipulates sigma values by flipping the order of the sequence and ensuring the first value is set to a minimal positive value if it was originally zero."
