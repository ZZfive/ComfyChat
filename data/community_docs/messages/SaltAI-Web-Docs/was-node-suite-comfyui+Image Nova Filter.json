        "question": "What is the 'Image Nova Filter' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Nova Filter' node is used to apply a 'Nova' filter effect to images, enhancing them with a specific visual style that alters their appearance in a distinctive way."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Image Nova Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types are: 'image', which is the input image(s) to which the Nova filter effect will be applied; 'amplitude', which adjusts the intensity of the Nova filter effect; and 'frequency', which controls the frequency of the visual patterns introduced by the Nova filter effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Image Nova Filter' node modify images?",
        "answer": "The node modifies images by applying a 'Nova' filter effect that enhances the images with a specific visual style, altering their appearance. This is achieved through modifying various aspects of the image, influenced by the 'amplitude' and 'frequency' parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'amplitude' parameter for in the 'Image Nova Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter in the 'Image Nova Filter' node adjusts the intensity of the Nova filter effect, influencing the degree of visual alteration applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'frequency' parameter for in the 'Image Nova Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The 'frequency' parameter in the 'Image Nova Filter' node controls the frequency of the visual patterns introduced by the Nova filter effect, affecting the overall texture and appearance of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'Image Nova Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'Image Nova Filter' node is the transformed image(s) after the application of the Nova filter effect, showcasing the distinctive visual style imparted by the filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'image' input in the 'Image Nova Filter' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input in the 'Image Nova Filter' node is 'torch.Tensor'."
