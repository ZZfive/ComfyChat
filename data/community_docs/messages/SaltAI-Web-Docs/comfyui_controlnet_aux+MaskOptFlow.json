        "question": "What is the MaskOptFlow node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "MaskOptFlow is a node in ComfyUI that applies a mask to optical flow input, filtering the optical flow data based on the provided mask to isolate relevant motion information from specific regions of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node requires two input types: 'optical_flow' which represents motion between two consecutive frames, and 'mask' which filters the optical flow data, retaining only the motion information from regions of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'mask' input in the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'mask' input in the MaskOptFlow node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the MaskOptFlow node provide?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node provides two outputs: 'OPTICAL_FLOW', which is the filtered optical flow data after applying the mask, and 'PREVIEW_IMAGE', which is a visualization of the filtered optical flow."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskOptFlow node handle the output preview image?",
        "answer": "The 'PREVIEW_IMAGE' output of the MaskOptFlow node is a visualization of the filtered optical flow, which provides a visual representation of the motion information retained by the mask. It is represented in ComfyUI with the dtype 'IMAGE' and in Python as 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'mask' input in the MaskOptFlow node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the 'mask' input in the MaskOptFlow node is to filter the optical flow data, allowing only the motion information from the specified regions of interest to be retained, based on the given mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the MaskOptFlow node belong to in ComfyUI's ControlNet Preprocessors?",
        "answer": "The MaskOptFlow node belongs to the 'Optical Flow' category within the ControlNet Preprocessors in ComfyUI."
