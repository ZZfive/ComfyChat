        "question": "What is the purpose of the ConvertNormals node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ConvertNormals node is designed to transform normal maps between different formats, adjust their scale, and optionally normalize or fill missing areas in the context of graphics and image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `normals` input parameter represent in the ConvertNormals node?",
        "answer": "The `normals` input parameter is the input normal map tensor to be transformed, central to the node's operation, undergoing various transformations based on other input parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ConvertNormals node modify the input normal map based on the `output_mode` parameter?",
        "answer": "The `output_mode` parameter defines the desired format for the output normal map, guiding the final adjustments made to the tensor to meet specific format requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the `scale_XY` parameter in the ConvertNormals node?",
        "answer": "The `scale_XY` parameter applies a scaling factor to the X and Y components of the normal map, affecting its overall appearance and fine-tuning the visual impact of the normal map on surfaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenarios is the `normalize` parameter useful in the ConvertNormals node?",
        "answer": "The `normalize` parameter is useful for ensuring that the normal map's vectors are unit length after transformations, which is often required for consistent lighting effects in graphics and image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `fix_black` parameter in the ConvertNormals node?",
        "answer": "The `fix_black` parameter, when enabled, applies a correction to black areas in the normal map, potentially filling these areas based on the `optional_fill` parameter, useful for repairing or enhancing normal maps with missing data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the ConvertNormals node generate?",
        "answer": "The ConvertNormals node generates an output of type `IMAGE`, which is the transformed normal map tensor adjusted according to the specified input and output modes, scaling, normalization, and optional filling."
