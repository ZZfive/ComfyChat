        "question": "What is the purpose of the SMPLShapeParameters node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SMPLShapeParameters node is designed to adjust the shape parameters of an SMPL model based on various anthropometric measurements, allowing modification of the model's dimensions to achieve a desired appearance or match specific physical characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for the SMPLShapeParameters node to adjust the shape of an SMPL model?",
        "answer": "The 'smpl' input is crucial for the SMPLShapeParameters node, as it serves as the base model whose shape parameters will be adjusted according to the provided measurements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the 'smpl' input in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'smpl' input in the SMPLShapeParameters node has a Comfy dtype of 'SMPL' and a Python dtype of 'dict'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the thickness of the SMPL model in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The 'thickness' input in the SMPLShapeParameters node controls the thickness of the SMPL model, influencing its volume and bulk."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'thickness' input and what are its permissible values?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'thickness' input is 'FLOAT', and its permissible values are within the range from -100 to 100 with a step of 0.01."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in the SMPLShapeParameters node alters the torso length?",
        "answer": "The 'upper_body_height' input in the SMPLShapeParameters node adjusts the height of the upper body, altering the torso length."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the waist width of the SMPL model controlled in the SMPLShapeParameters node?",
        "answer": "The waist width of the SMPL model is controlled by the 'waist_width' input, which adjusts the width of the waist, affecting the model's silhouette."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the SMPLShapeParameters node after modifying the SMPL model?",
        "answer": "The SMPLShapeParameters node returns the modified SMPL model with updated shape parameters reflecting the input measurements, denoted as the 'smpl' output with a Comfy dtype of 'SMPL' and a Python dtype of 'dict'."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of infrastructure does the SMPLShapeParameters node operate?",
        "answer": "The SMPLShapeParameters node operates on CPU infrastructure."
