        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlLoraSave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlLoraSave node is designed to save the modified state of a model and its control network to a file, incorporating LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ControlLoraSave node are `model`, `control_net`, `filename_prefix`, and `rank`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` input parameter represent in the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The `model` input parameter represents the neural network model whose state is to be saved with LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `control_net` parameter play in the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The `control_net` parameter signifies the control network associated with the model, which is essential for extracting and applying LoRA adjustments to the model's parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `filename_prefix` parameter in the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The `filename_prefix` parameter specifies the prefix for the output file names, allowing for organized storage and easy identification of saved models."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `rank` parameter affect the LoRA adjustments in the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The `rank` parameter determines the rank of the LoRA adjustments, influencing the granularity and extent of modifications applied to the model's parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type and the associated category for the ControlLoraSave node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the ControlLoraSave node is `GPU`, and it falls under the category `stability/controlnet`."
