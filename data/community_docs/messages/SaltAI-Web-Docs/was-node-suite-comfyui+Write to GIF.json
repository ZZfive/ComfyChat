        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Write to GIF' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to GIF' node in ComfyUI is designed to create and edit GIF animations from images, allowing for the generation of new GIFs, appending images to existing GIFs with transitions, and adjusting animation parameters such as frame duration and looping behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs the 'Write to GIF' node requires for its operation?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to GIF' node requires 'image', 'transition_frames', 'image_delay_ms', 'duration_ms', 'loops', 'max_size', 'output_path', and 'filename' as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' input represent in the 'Write to GIF' node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the 'Write to GIF' node represents the image to be written into a GIF. It can be a new image for creating a GIF or an additional frame to be appended to an existing GIF animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Write to GIF' node use the 'transition_frames' input?",
        "answer": "The 'transition_frames' input in the 'Write to GIF' node specifies the number of frames to be used for transitions between images in the GIF, affecting the smoothness and duration of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'max_size' in the 'Write to GIF' node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_size' input in the 'Write to GIF' node determines the maximum size of the images in the GIF, ensuring that the GIF does not exceed a certain dimension for compatibility and performance reasons."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the 'Write to GIF' node generate?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to GIF' node generates 'image_pass', 'filepath_text', and 'filename_text' as outputs, representing the final image or last frame added to the GIF, the full file path of the saved GIF, and the name of the GIF file, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python library is required for the 'Write to GIF' node to function correctly and what is the condition for its installation?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to GIF' node requires the 'imageio' library for functionality. If 'imageio' is not already installed in the packages, it will be installed before the node runs."
