        "question": "What is InstructPixToPixConditioning?",
        "answer": "InstructPixToPixConditioning is a class in ComfyUI designed for encoding images into a conditioning format suitable for the InstructPix2Pix model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of InstructPixToPixConditioning?",
        "answer": "The category of InstructPixToPixConditioning is conditioning/instructpix2pix."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for InstructPixToPixConditioning?",
        "answer": "The required input types for InstructPixToPixConditioning include positive conditioning data, negative conditioning data, a variational autoencoder (VAE), and pixel data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does InstructPixToPixConditioning handle pixel data input?",
        "answer": "InstructPixToPixConditioning handles pixel data input by ensuring its dimensions are multiples of 8, adjusting offsets if necessary, and then encoding it using a variational autoencoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of InstructPixToPixConditioning?",
        "answer": "The output types of InstructPixToPixConditioning include encoded positive conditioning data, encoded negative conditioning data, and the latent space representation of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type recommended for InstructPixToPixConditioning?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type recommended for InstructPixToPixConditioning is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does InstructPixToPixConditioning define its return types?",
        "answer": "InstructPixToPixConditioning defines its return types as 'CONDITIONING', 'CONDITIONING', and 'LATENT'."
