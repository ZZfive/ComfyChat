        "question": "What is the 'Image Select Channel' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Select Channel' node in ComfyUI is designed to isolate and extract a specific color channel (red, green, or blue) from an input image, converting the selected channel into a greyscale image, which is then recombined into a three-channel image where all channels are the same."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the 'Image Select Channel' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Select Channel' node requires two input types: 'image', which is the input image to be processed, and 'channel', which specifies the color channel ('red', 'green', or 'blue') to isolate from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'Image Select Channel' node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'Image Select Channel' node is 'image', representing the processed image where the selected color channel has been isolated and converted into a greyscale image, and then recombined into a three-channel image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Image Select Channel' node process images?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Select Channel' node processes images by isolating a specific color channel ('red', 'green', or 'blue') from the input image, converting the selected channel into a greyscale image, and then recombining it into a three-channel image where all channels contain the same greyscale image, effectively filtering the image through the lens of the selected channel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What format does the 'image' input need to be in for the 'Image Select Channel' node?",
        "answer": "For the 'Image Select Channel' node, the 'image' input should be in the Comfy dtype `IMAGE`, which corresponds to `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which color channels can be selected using the 'Image Select Channel' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Select Channel' node allows selection of the 'red', 'green', or 'blue' color channels from the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'channel' input in the 'Image Select Channel' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'channel' input in the 'Image Select Channel' node is `str`, representing the selected color channel."
