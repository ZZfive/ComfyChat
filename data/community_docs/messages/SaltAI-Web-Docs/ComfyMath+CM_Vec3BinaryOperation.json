    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec3BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_Vec3BinaryOperation include 'op', which specifies the binary operation, 'a', the first 3-dimensional vector operand, and 'b', the second 3-dimensional vector operand."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for 'op' in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for 'op' in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation is COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for 'a' and 'b' in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for both 'a' and 'b' in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation is VEC3."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec3BinaryOperation return as output?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec3BinaryOperation returns a 3-dimensional vector (VEC3) after performing the specified binary operation on the input vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'op' method in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation operate?",
        "answer": "The 'op' method in CM_Vec3BinaryOperation performs the specified binary operation on two 3-dimensional vectors 'a' and 'b', converting them using numpy arrays and then returning the result as a tuple of Vec3."
