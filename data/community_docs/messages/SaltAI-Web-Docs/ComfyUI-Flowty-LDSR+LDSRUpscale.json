        "question": "What is the role of the LDSRUpscale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LDSRUpscale node in ComfyUI is designed to upscale images using a specified model, with options for pre and post downscaling, and a choice of downsample methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LDSRUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LDSRUpscale node include `upscale_model`, `images`, `steps`, `pre_downscale`, `post_downscale`, and `downsample_method`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `upscale_model` input in the LDSRUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The `upscale_model` input specifies the model to be used for upscaling the images, determining the upscaling technique and quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the quality of upscaling in the LDSRUpscale node affected?",
        "answer": "The quality of upscaling in the LDSRUpscale node is affected by the number of steps used in the upscaling process, the details of which directly impact the quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `pre_downscale` and `post_downscale` inputs in the LDSRUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The `pre_downscale` and `post_downscale` inputs serve as optional pre and post-processing steps that can affect the quality and performance of the upscaling, as well as allow for size customization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the `downsample_method` option in the LDSRUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The `downsample_method` option influences the quality of the downscaled images during pre and post downscale steps, affecting the overall output of the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the LDSRUpscale node output?",
        "answer": "The LDSRUpscale node outputs upscaled images, enhanced in resolution and detail through the specified upscaling process, with the data type being `torch.Tensor`."
