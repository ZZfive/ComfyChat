        "question": "What is the class name for the node that generates a list of random values in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name is `SaltScheduleRandomValues`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltScheduleRandomValues node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleRandomValues node belongs to the `SALT/Scheduling` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `count` input determine the output of the SaltScheduleRandomValues node?",
        "answer": "The `count` input specifies the number of random values to generate, dictating the length of the output list."

    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy and Python dtypes for the `min_value` and `max_value` inputs in the SaltScheduleRandomValues node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtypes for `min_value` and `max_value` are `FLOAT`, and the Python dtypes are `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `force_integer` input control in the SaltScheduleRandomValues node?",
        "answer": "The `force_integer` input determines whether the generated random values should be integers, adding a layer of control over the output data type."
