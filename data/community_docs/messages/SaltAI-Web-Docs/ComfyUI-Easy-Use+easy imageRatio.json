        "question": "What is easy imageRatio?",
        "answer": "`easy imageRatio` is a node in ComfyUI that calculates simplified width and height ratios of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the easy imageRatio node output?",
        "answer": "The easy imageRatio node outputs integer and floating-point representations of the simplified width and height ratios of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the easy imageRatio node?",
        "answer": "The easy imageRatio node requires an input image, which is a Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and a Python dtype `Tuple[int, int, int, int]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy imageRatio node compute the width and height ratios?",
        "answer": "The easy imageRatio node computes the width and height ratios using the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the image dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ui` output from the easy imageRatio node display?",
        "answer": "The `ui` output from the easy imageRatio node displays the image ratio in a human-readable format, such as '4:3'."
