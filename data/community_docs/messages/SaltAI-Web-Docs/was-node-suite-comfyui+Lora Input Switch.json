        "question": "What is the purpose of the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively switch between two sets of model and CLIP inputs based on a boolean condition, facilitating dynamic input selection for further processing or model application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `model_a` represent in the context of WAS_Lora_Input_Switch?",
        "answer": "`model_a` represents the first model input option in WAS_Lora_Input_Switch. This model is selected if the boolean condition is true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What impact does the boolean input have on WAS_Lora_Input_Switch?",
        "answer": "The boolean input in WAS_Lora_Input_Switch determines which set of inputs (model_a and clip_a or model_b and clip_b) is selected for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category of nodes does the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Logic' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does WAS_Lora_Input_Switch provide for CLIP?",
        "answer": "The output type for CLIP from the WAS_Lora_Input_Switch is the selected CLIP based on the boolean condition, with Comfy dtype as 'CLIP' and Python dtype as 'object'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node allows for conditional model and CLIP input selection in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node allows for conditional selection of model and CLIP inputs in ComfyUI based on a boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'boolean' input affect the model input selection in WAS_Lora_Input_Switch?",
        "answer": "In WAS_Lora_Input_Switch, if 'boolean' is true, 'model_a' is selected; otherwise, 'model_b' is selected."
