        "question": "What is the IFRNet VFI node and where does it belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "IFRNet VFI is a custom node in ComfyUI that belongs to the ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/VFI category, designed for video frame interpolation using deep learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the IFRNet VFI node in video processing?",
        "answer": "The IFRNet VFI node is used for enhancing video smoothness and increasing the frame rate by generating intermediate frames between existing ones in a video sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter specifies the model to be used for frame interpolation in the IFRNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The parameter `ckpt_name` specifies the checkpoint name for the model, affecting the interpolation quality and style based on the trained data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `frames` parameter play in the IFRNet VFI node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `frames` parameter represents the input video frames to be interpolated, serving as the basis for generating intermediate frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `clear_cache_after_n_frames` parameter prevent memory overflow in the IFRNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `clear_cache_after_n_frames` parameter determines the number of frames after which the cache should be cleared to manage memory usage, ensuring the system does not run out of memory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the `multiplier` parameter in the IFRNet VFI node on the output of the video?",
        "answer": "The `multiplier` parameter defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly influencing the output video's enhanced frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of the `scale_factor` parameter in the IFRNet VFI node?",
        "answer": "The `scale_factor` parameter influences the resolution of the output frames by specifying the scale factor for resizing frames during the interpolation process."
