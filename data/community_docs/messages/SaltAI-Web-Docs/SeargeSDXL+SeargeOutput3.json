        "question": "What does SeargeOutput3 do in the context of generative models?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput3 facilitates the customization and fine-tuning of generative models or processes by demultiplexing and extracting advanced parameters from a given input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is necessary for the SeargeOutput3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput3 requires the `parameters` input, which represents the advanced parameters for generative processes and is crucial in customizing and fine-tuning the output."

    {
        "question": "Which input data type does the `parameters` input of SeargeOutput3 expect?",
        "answer": "The `parameters` input of SeargeOutput3 expects the `PARAMETERS` data type, which is a dictionary-like object containing various generative parameters."
