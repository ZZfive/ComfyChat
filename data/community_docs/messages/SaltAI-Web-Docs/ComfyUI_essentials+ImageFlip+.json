        "question": "What is ImageFlip+?",
        "answer": "ImageFlip+ is a custom node in ComfyUI that provides functionality for flipping images along specified axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageFlip+ belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImageFlip+ belongs to the 'essentials' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of flipping can ImageFlip+ perform on images?",
        "answer": "ImageFlip+ can perform horizontal, vertical, or both horizontal and vertical flipping on images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the 'image' parameter in ImageFlip+?",
        "answer": "The required input for the 'image' parameter in ImageFlip+ is an image in the format of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'axis' parameter in ImageFlip+ specify?",
        "answer": "The 'axis' parameter in ImageFlip+ specifies the axes along which the image will be flipped, such as 'x', 'y', or 'xy'."
