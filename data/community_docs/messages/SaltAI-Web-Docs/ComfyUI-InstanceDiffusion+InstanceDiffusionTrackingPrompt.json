        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node is to integrate text-based prompts with instance tracking information for conditioned inputs in instance diffusion models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'positive' parameter represent in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' parameter in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node represents the initial conditioning data for positive instances, which serves as a foundation for applying text-based conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'clip' parameter utilized in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter is utilized in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node as a model for encoding text prompts into embeddings, which is crucial for the interpretation of textual information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'positive_text' input represent in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive_text' input in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node is a multiline string containing text prompts related to positive instances, which will be processed and encoded for conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format for the 'positive' and 'negative' data after processing by the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The output format for both 'positive' and 'negative' data after processing by the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node is list, which contains conditioned data enriched with text-based prompts and spatial tracking information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'fusers' in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node?",
        "answer": "The 'fusers' in the InstanceDiffusionTrackingPrompt node are mechanisms that integrate multiple sources of information, such as embeddings and spatial data, to enhance the conditioning process."
