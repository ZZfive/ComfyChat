        "question": "What is the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioPlaybackRate node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the playback speed of an audio file, allowing users to speed up or slow down the audio without altering its pitch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node is `SaltAudioPlaybackRate`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node include `audio` (Comfy dtype: `AUDIO`, Python dtype: `bytes`) and `speed_factor` (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `speed_factor` input control in the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node?",
        "answer": "The `speed_factor` input in the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node controls the factor by which the audio's speed is adjusted, directly influencing the rate at which the audio is played back."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node is `audio` (Comfy dtype: `AUDIO`, Python dtype: `bytes`), which is the processed audio file ready for playback at the new speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used alongside the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The documentation for the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node does not specify any common nodes that are typically used alongside it."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the audio speed adjusted internally by the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node?",
        "answer": "Internally, the SaltAudioPlaybackRate node reads the audio input as a WAV file, calculates the playback rate based on the `speed_factor`, and adjusts the frame rate of the audio segment accordingly."
