        "question": "What is the purpose of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAIPrimitiveConverter node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the conversion of input data between different primitive data types, handling various formats such as strings, lists, and dictionaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SAIPrimitiveConverter node are `input_value`, which is the raw input value to be converted, and `output_type`, which specifies the desired output data type for conversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `sub_data_type` parameter play in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The `sub_data_type` parameter in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node defines the sub-type for the conversion, further refining the transformation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the value of `index_or_key` used in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The value of `index_or_key` in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node allows for indexing into lists or accessing values by key in dictionaries, enabling precise data extraction from complex data structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SAIPrimitiveConverter node is the converted data, presented in the specified output type, reflecting the transformation applied to the input value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "Usage tips for the SAIPrimitiveConverter node include that it is CPU-based and commonly used for data type conversion tasks in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for the conversion logic in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node?",
        "answer": "The class `SAIPrimitiveConverter` is responsible for the conversion logic in the SAIPrimitiveConverter node, handling input values and output types according to the conversion specifications."
