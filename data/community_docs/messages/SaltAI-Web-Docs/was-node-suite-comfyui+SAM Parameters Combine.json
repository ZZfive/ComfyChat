        "question": "What is the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'SAM Parameters Combine' node in ComfyUI is used to combine the parameters of two SAM (Spatial Attention Model) operations, effectively merging their points and labels into a single set. It's designed to facilitate the application of multiple SAM operations on a single image or dataset by consolidating their parameters for streamlined processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific inputs does the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node require?",
        "answer": "The 'SAM Parameters Combine' node requires two specific inputs: 'sam_parameters_a' and 'sam_parameters_b', both of which are the sets of SAM parameters to be combined, including points and labels that specify regions of interest and their corresponding labels in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node handle the output of combined SAM parameters?",
        "answer": "The 'SAM Parameters Combine' node outputs the combined SAM parameters as a single set, including points and labels from both input sets, which is ready for use in subsequent SAM operations. The output is of type 'SAM_PARAMETERS' and is represented as a Python dictionary with NumPy ndarray values."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'SAM Parameters Combine' node is categorized under 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name implemented in the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node for combining parameters?",
        "answer": "The function name implemented in the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node for combining parameters is 'sam_combine_parameters'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing does the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node utilize?",
        "answer": "The 'SAM Parameters Combine' node utilizes CPU-based processing for efficiency in consolidating the SAM parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes are associated with the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify any common nodes that are associated with the 'SAM Parameters Combine' node in ComfyUI."
