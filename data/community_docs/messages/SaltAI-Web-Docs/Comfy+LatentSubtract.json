        "question": "What is LatentSubtract?",
        "answer": "LatentSubtract is a node in ComfyUI designed for subtracting one latent representation from another, typically used to manipulate or modify generative models' outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LatentSubtract node do?",
        "answer": "The LatentSubtract node subtracts one set of latent samples (`samples2`) from another set (`samples1`), altering the characteristics of generative model outputs by removing specific attributes or features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The LatentSubtract node requires two inputs: `samples1` and `samples2`, both of type `LATENT`. These inputs are dictionaries containing tensors that represent latent samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LatentSubtract node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentSubtract node is `LATENT`, which is a modified latent representation resulting from subtracting `samples2` from `samples1`. The output is a tuple containing dictionaries of tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can LatentSubtract be used to manipulate generative model outputs?",
        "answer": "LatentSubtract manipulates generative model outputs by subtracting one set of latent samples from another. This operation effectively removes specific attributes or features represented in the second set from the first, altering the characteristics of the generated outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for using LatentSubtract?",
        "answer": "LatentSubtract is recommended to be used with GPU infrastructures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does LatentSubtract belong to?",
        "answer": "LatentSubtract belongs to the category `latent/advanced` in ComfyUI."
