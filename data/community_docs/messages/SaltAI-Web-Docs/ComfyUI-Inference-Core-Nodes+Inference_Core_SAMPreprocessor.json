        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is used for segmenting images using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the SAM Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the SAM Preprocessor node is `Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node falls under the category `ControlNet Preprocessors/others` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input represent in the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input represents the primary data the SAM Preprocessor operates on, which is the input image to be segmented, determining the areas of interest within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input `resolution` for in the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional input `resolution` specifies the resolution to which the input image should be scaled before segmentation in the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node, affecting the granularity and quality of the segmentation output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node return?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node returns the segmented version of the input image, highlighting different regions as determined by the SAM model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output `image` in the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output `image` in the Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor node is `torch.Tensor`."
