        "question": "What is the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The Image Threshold node is a ComfyUI custom node designed to process images by applying a thresholding technique, converting them into binary images based on a specified threshold value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The Image Threshold node is categorized under 'WAS Suite/Image/Process'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input named 'image' in the Image Threshold node used for?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input parameter in the Image Threshold node represents the input image to be thresholded, acting as the source on which the threshold will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'threshold' parameter determine in the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in the Image Threshold node determines the cutoff value for converting the grayscale image into a binary image, directly influencing the outcome by specifying the intensity level at which pixels are classified as either foreground or background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Threshold node is a binary image where pixels are either set to the maximum value (representing the foreground) or zero (representing the background), based on the applied threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the 'threshold' parameter in the Python implementation of the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the 'threshold' parameter in the Python implementation of the Image Threshold node is 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the functionality of the Image Threshold node?",
        "answer": "The class 'WAS_Image_Threshold' implements the functionality of the Image Threshold node in ComfyUI."
