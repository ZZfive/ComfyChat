        "question": "What is the Color Clip node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color Clip node in ComfyUI is designed to modify the colors within an image based on specific target and complement operations, potentially using additional color parameters for advanced adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the Color Clip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the Color Clip node in ComfyUI is the image to be processed, which determines the visual output of the node and is directly influenced by the operations and color parameters specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the target parameter specify in the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The target parameter specifies the target operation for color manipulation, such as converting to black or white, or applying no change, and it defines the primary action to be performed on the image's colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the complement parameter in the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The complement parameter defines the complementary operation to the target, offering an additional layer of color adjustment, and it works in conjunction with the target to refine the color effects achieved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the color parameter represent in the Color Clip node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The color parameter in the Color Clip node of ComfyUI represents the base color used for manipulation in the image and plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the color clip operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Color Clip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the Color Clip node in ComfyUI is the resulting image after color manipulation, which reflects the changes made based on the specified target, complement, and color parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is the Color Clip node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color Clip node in ComfyUI is categorized under the Bmad/image category and is an input node due to it not being an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the image input in the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the image input in the Color Clip node is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the target input in the Color Clip node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the target input in the Color Clip node is str."
