        "question": "What does the mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI transforms textual descriptions into motion data sequences using a MotionGPT model, enabling the generation of motion sequences based on natural language inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the MotionGPT model used for in the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The MotionGPT model in the mgpt_t2m node is used for generating motion sequences from text, interpreting the textual input and producing corresponding motion data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter specifies the desired length of the generated motion sequence in the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The `motion_length` parameter specifies the desired length of the generated motion sequence in the mgpt_t2m node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the `motion_data` output by the mgpt_t2m node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `motion_data` output by the mgpt_t2m node is `Dict[str, np.ndarray]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `text` parameter in the mgpt_t2m node represent, and what is its Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "The `text` parameter in the mgpt_t2m node represents the textual description that guides the generation of the motion sequence, and its Comfy dtype is `STRING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infra type should the mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI be typically run?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI should typically be run on a `GPU` infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the mgpt_t2m node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The mgpt_t2m node belongs to the `MotionDiff/mGPT` category in ComfyUI."
