        "question": "What is CM_SDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution is a class in ComfyUI designed for converting a string representation of a resolution into its numerical width and height components."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_SDXLResolution belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution belongs to the 'math/graphics' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of CM_SDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution serves to convert a string representation of an image resolution (in the format 'widthxheight') into numeric values representing width and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CM_SDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution requires the input 'resolution', which is a string representing an image resolution (e.g., '1920x1080')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CM_SDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution outputs two integers: 'width' and 'height', which represent the numerical components of the input resolution string."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_SDXLResolution handle the 'resolution' input?",
        "answer": "CM_SDXLResolution splits the 'resolution' input string at 'x' to extract and convert the width and height into integers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'resolution' input in CM_SDXLResolution?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'resolution' input in CM_SDXLResolution is COMBO[STRING]."
