        "question": "What is the Bbox (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Bbox (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a bounding box (bbox) based on specified dimensions, facilitating operations like cropping or region of interest (ROI) identification within images or frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x' input represent in the Bbox (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' input in the Bbox (mtb) node represents the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, which serves as the starting point for the rectangle's horizontal dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'width' input specify in the Bbox (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in the Bbox (mtb) node specifies the width of the bounding box, determining how far it extends horizontally from the x-coordinate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does the 'height' input in Bbox (mtb) handle?",
        "answer": "The 'height' input in the Bbox (mtb) node handles 'INT' data types, determining the vertical extension of the bounding box from the 'y' coordinate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'bbox' output in the context of the Bbox (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox' output in the Bbox (mtb) node is a tuple that represents the bounding box, structured as (x, y, width, height), which is useful for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which image operations can be facilitated by the Bbox (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Bbox (mtb) node in ComfyUI can facilitate cropping and region of interest (ROI) identification in images or frames by generating a bounding box based on specified coordinates and dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the 'bbox' from the Bbox (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the 'bbox' from the Bbox (mtb) node is 'BBOX' in ComfyUI's data handling, represented as a tuple with Python dtype of 'Tuple[int, int, int, int]'."
