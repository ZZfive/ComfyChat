        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mikey Sampler Base Only node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler Base Only node is designed for basic sampling operations, providing a streamlined approach to sample generation without the advanced features found in other nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Mikey Sampler Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Mikey Sampler Base Only node include: 'base_model' (specifics the model used for the sampling process), 'samples' (the initial set of samples or data points), 'positive_cond_base' (specifies positive conditioning), 'negative_cond_base' (specifies negative conditioning), 'vae' (the VAE used for sampling), 'model_name' (the name of the model used for upscaling), 'seed' (ensures reproducibility), 'upscale_by' (upscales the samples by a factor), 'hires_strength' (determines high-resolution features), and 'smooth_step' (controls the smoothness of the transition)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'base_model' parameter influence the sampling process in the Mikey Sampler Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_model' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Base Only node specifies the model used for the sampling process, serving as the foundation for generating samples and defining the behavior and capabilities of the sampling operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the role of the 'vae' input in Mikey Sampler Base Only?",
        "answer": "The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) input in the Mikey Sampler Base Only is used in the sampling process for generating or refining samples, playing a critical role in the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'upscale_by' parameter do in the Mikey Sampler Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_by' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Base Only node is used to upscale the samples by a certain factor, improving their resolution or detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'hires_strength' parameter in the context of the Mikey Sampler Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The 'hires_strength' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Base Only node determines the strength of high-resolution features in the upscaled samples, affecting their clarity and detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the Mikey Sampler Base Only node produce?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler Base Only node produces a 'latent' output type, which is a latent representation generated based on the input parameters, suitable for further processing or generation."
