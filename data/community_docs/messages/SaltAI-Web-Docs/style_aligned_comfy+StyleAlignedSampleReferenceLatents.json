        "question": "What is the purpose of the StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node is designed to sample reference latents in a style-aligned manner, enabling the creation of content that is stylistically coherent by manipulating latents to capture the essence of a given style."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the latent_image parameter represent in the StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node?",
        "answer": "The latent_image parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents represents the initial latent image that serves as a starting point for the sampling process, providing a basis for the generation and alignment of reference latents."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the positive parameter influence the generation process in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents?",
        "answer": "The positive parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node indicates the positive guidance text or attributes that should be emphasized in the generated content, steering the style alignment towards these characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the sampler parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents?",
        "answer": "The sampler parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents determines the specific sampling strategy or algorithm to be used in generating the reference latents, affecting the diversity and quality of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents is used to control the variance of the noise added during the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The sigmas parameter in StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents controls the variance of the noise added during the sampling process, influencing the exploration of the latent space and the resulting style alignment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output 'ref_latents' contain in the StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node?",
        "answer": "The ref_latents output in the StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents node contains the generated reference latents that are aligned with the specified style, ready for further processing or utilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python dtypes associated with the input types of StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents?",
        "answer": "The Python dtypes associated with the input types of StyleAlignedSampleReferenceLatents include ModelPatcher (model), int (noise_seed), float (cfg), str (positive and negative), Sampler (sampler), torch.Tensor (sigmas and samples key in latent_image)."
