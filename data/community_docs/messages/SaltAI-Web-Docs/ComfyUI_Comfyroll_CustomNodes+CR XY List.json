        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR XY List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR XY List node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a pair of outputs based on the Cartesian product of two input lists, with the capability to prepend and append custom text to each element, and provide annotations for the last iteration of the Cartesian product."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the input `index` in the CR XY List node specify?",
        "answer": "The input `index` in the CR XY List node specifies the index to select a specific pair from the Cartesian product, with indexing starting from 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used to control the first list in the Cartesian product in the CR XY List node?",
        "answer": "The input `list1` is used to control the first list in the Cartesian product in the CR XY List node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output `X` represent in the CR XY List node?",
        "answer": "The output `X` in the CR XY List node represents the processed output from the first list after applying prepend and append operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is theinfra type of the CR XY List node and what does it mean in terms of processing?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the CR XY List node is `CPU`, which means that the operations performed by the node are executed on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes used with the CR XY List node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The common nodes used with the CR XY List node in ComfyUI are not specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `trigger` output in the CR XY List node and when is it set to true?",
        "answer": "The `trigger` output in the CR XY List node is a boolean flag indicating if the current iteration is the last one in the Cartesian product, and it is set to true when the current iteration is the last one."
