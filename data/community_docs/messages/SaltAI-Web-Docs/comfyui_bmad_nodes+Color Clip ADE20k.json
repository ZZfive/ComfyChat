        "question": "What is the Color Clip ADE20k node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Color Clip ADE20k node is used for adjusting the color of images based on the ADE20K dataset, allowing specific class-based color clipping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Color Clip ADE20k node include `image`, `target`, `complement`, and `class_name`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `image` input work in the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input serves as the base for color modification, where the clipping operation will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `target` input used for in the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The `target` input defines the target operation for the color clipping, such as converting to black, white, or maintaining the original color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `complement` input control in the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The `complement` input specifies the complementary operation to the target, offering additional control over the color clipping process."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `class_name` input in the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The `class_name` input specifies the ADE20K class name whose associated color will be used for clipping the image's color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Color Clip ADE20k node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Color Clip ADE20k node is the resulting image after the color clipping operation, showcasing the applied color adjustments."
