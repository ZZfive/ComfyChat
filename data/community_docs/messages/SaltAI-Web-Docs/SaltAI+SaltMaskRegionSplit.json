        "question": "What is the SaltMaskRegionSplit node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskRegionSplit node in ComfyUI is designed to isolate and split different regions within a given set of masks, effectively segmenting them into distinct areas based on connectivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SaltMaskRegionSplit node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SaltMaskRegionSplit node are region1, region2, region3, region4, region5, and region6, each of which is a MASK type representing the isolated regions from the input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the masks parameter in the SaltMaskRegionSplit node?",
        "answer": "The masks parameter in the SaltMaskRegionSplit node is crucial for determining the segmentation outcome, as it directly influences the isolation of different areas within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the SaltMaskRegionSplit node, what do the regions like region1, region2, etc. represent?",
        "answer": "In the SaltMaskRegionSplit node, regions like region1, region2, etc., represent isolated areas segmented from the input masks based on connectivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the input and output parameters of the SaltMaskRegionSplit node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input parameter masks in the SaltMaskRegionSplit node and for the outputs such as region1, region2, etc., is MASK, and the Python dtype is torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node would you use in ComfyUI to split a mask into distinct regions?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, you would use the SaltMaskRegionSplit node to split a mask into distinct regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the isolated regions from the SaltMaskRegionSplit node ultimately represented?",
        "answer": "The isolated regions from the SaltMaskRegionSplit node are ultimately represented as a list of region outputs, each being a tensor that corresponds to a specific isolated region from the masks."
