        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Sum node in Derfuu_Nodes/Math category?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node is designed to perform arithmetic addition, taking two float inputs and returning their sum as a float output. This node is used within a mathematical or computational context to simplify the process of adding numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DF_Sum node calculate the sum?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node calculates the sum by adding two input values, Value_A and Value_B, both of which are of type float."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sum node requires two input types: Value_A and Value_B, both of which are of type FLOAT and are represented as float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for representation in ComfyUI and Python for the inputs of DF_Sum node?",
        "answer": "The inputs of DF_Sum node, Value_A and Value_B, are represented as FLOAT in ComfyUI and as float in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the DF_Sum node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the DF_Sum node represents the result of adding the two input values, Value_A and Value_B, which is then returned as a float output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Sum node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Sum node is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of operations does DF_Sum facilitate within a mathematical context?",
        "answer": "DF_Sum facilitates operations that require summation, particularly addition of two float inputs within a mathematical or computational context."
