        "question": "What is MergeModels?",
        "answer": "MergeModels is a custom node in ComfyUI under the category Art Venture/Utils that blends two models together based on a specified ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of MergeModels?",
        "answer": "The purpose of MergeModels is to merge characteristics and features from two input models, creating hybrid models that combine attributes of both."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for MergeModels?",
        "answer": "MergeModels requires inputs including 'model1', 'model2', and 'ratio'. 'model1' serves as the base model, 'model2' provides patches to be applied, and 'ratio' determines the balance between the two models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of MergeModels?",
        "answer": "The output type of MergeModels is a 'MODEL', which is the resulting model after blending 'model1' and 'model2' based on the specified ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does MergeModels determine the influence of patches from 'model2'?",
        "answer": "MergeModels determines the influence of patches from 'model2' based on the floating-point value 'ratio'. A higher ratio gives more weight to the characteristics of 'model2' in the merged output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is recommended for MergeModels?",
        "answer": "MergeModels is recommended to run on CPU infra."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python function associated with MergeModels?",
        "answer": "The Python function associated with MergeModels is 'merge_models', which accepts 'model1', 'model2', and 'ratio' as parameters to perform the merging process."
