        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Gradient Map node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Gradient Map node is used to apply a gradient map to an image, optionally flipping the gradient map horizontally, transforming the input image by mapping its grayscale values to colors defined in the gradient map."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the Image Gradient Map node within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Gradient Map node can be found in the 'WAS Suite/Image/Filter' category of ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the gradient_image input in the Image Gradient Map node?",
        "answer": "The gradient_image input defines the color transformation that will be applied to the original image; the image's colors are mapped to the grayscale values of the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the 'image' parameter require in the Image Gradient Map node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the Image Gradient Map node requires a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor', representing the original image to which the gradient map will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'flip_left_right' input alter the functionality of the Image Gradient Map node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'flip_left_right' input, of type Comfy dtype 'COMBO[STRING]' and Python dtype 'bool', indicates whether the gradient map should be flipped horizontally before being applied, altering the visual effect of the gradient mapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Gradient Map node in terms of dtype and format?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Gradient Map node is a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' with a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor', representing the resulting image after applying the gradient map to the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class defines the functionality of the Image Gradient Map in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The functionality of the Image Gradient Map in ComfyUI is defined by the class 'WAS_Image_Gradient_Map' in the source code."
