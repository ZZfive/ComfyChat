        "question": "What is the SaltAudioStereoMerge node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioStereoMerge node in ComfyUI is designed to merge two mono audio inputs into a single stereo audio output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the node that merges two mono audio inputs into stereo?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that merges two mono audio inputs into stereo is `SaltAudioStereoMerge`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does SaltAudioStereoMerge fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioStereoMerge falls under the category `SALT/Audio/Effect` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for `audio_a` in the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The input type for `audio_a` in the SaltAudioStereoMerge node is `AUDIO`, and its Python dtype is `bytes`. It is the first audio input to be merged into the stereo audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to the input audio if it has more than one channel in the SaltAudioStereoMerge process?",
        "answer": "If the input audio has more than one channel in the SaltAudioStereoMerge process, it will be converted to mono before the merging to ensure both inputs are of the same length."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the stereo audio output generated by the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The stereo audio output is generated by first ensuring both input audio segments are mono. Then, the shorter of the two is used to trim the longer one, and the two are merged into stereo using the `AudioSegment.from_mono_audiosegments` method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the format of the audio output from the SaltAudioStereoMerge node?",
        "answer": "The audio output from the SaltAudioStereoMerge node is in the WAV format, and its Python dtype is `bytes`."
