        "question": "What category does the JWIntegerMin node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node belongs to the `jamesWalker55` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWIntegerMin node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node in ComfyUI is designed to compute the minimum of two integer values, simplifying operations that require minimum value determination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the JWIntegerMin node include two required integers, `a` and `b`, which are both of `INT` type in Comfy and `int` type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain what the input `a` represents in the JWIntegerMin node?",
        "answer": "In the JWIntegerMin node, the input `a` is the first integer value to be compared, playing a crucial role in determining the minimum value when compared with the second integer `b`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the JWIntegerMin node produce in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node in ComfyUI produces a single output, which is the minimum value obtained from comparing the two input integers, of type `int` in both Comfy and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of processing does the JWIntegerMin node support?",
        "answer": "The JWIntegerMin node supports `CPU` type processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what context might the JWIntegerMin node be commonly used in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The common usage of the JWIntegerMin node is not specified, but it is generally used where there is a need to determine the minimum value between two integer inputs."
