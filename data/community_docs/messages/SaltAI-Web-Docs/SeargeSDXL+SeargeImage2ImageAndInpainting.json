        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can modify images and apply inpainting techniques?",
        "answer": "The SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node in ComfyUI can modify images and apply inpainting techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the clarity and noise reduction in the output of the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The level of denoising specified by the `denoise` input determines the clarity and noise reduction in the output of the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the blur intensity of the inpainting mask controlled in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The blur intensity of the inpainting mask is controlled by the `inpaint_mask_blur` input in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `inpaint_mask_mode` input define in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node?",
        "answer": "The `inpaint_mask_mode` input defines the mode of inpainting mask application, dictating how the mask is used to guide the inpainting process in the SeargeImage2ImageAndInpainting node."
    },
    {
