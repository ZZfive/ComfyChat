        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI is designed to conditionally execute one of two possible outputs based on a boolean input, serving as a logical branch for dynamic flow control within a node-based execution environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ANY' input in the 'If ANY execute A else B' node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'ANY' input in the 'If ANY execute A else B' node is a boolean input that determines which of the two possible outputs to execute, dictating the flow of execution and enabling conditional logic within the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the 'IF_TRUE' and 'IF_FALSE' inputs function within the 'If ANY execute A else B' node?",
        "answer": "The 'IF_TRUE' input represents the output to be executed if the 'ANY' input is True, indicating the action taken when the condition is met. Conversely, the 'IF_FALSE' input represents the output to be executed if the 'ANY' input is False, indicating the action taken when the condition is not met."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node based on the 'ANY' input value?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node is determined by the value of the 'ANY' input; it will be the result of executing 'IF_TRUE' if 'ANY' is True, and 'IF_FALSE' if 'ANY' is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what ways can the inputs of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node be utilized?",
        "answer": "The 'ANY' input can be any boolean input. The 'IF_TRUE' and 'IF_FALSE' inputs can be any output, allowing for various conditional actions within the nodeâ€™s execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the category and function of the 'If ANY execute A else B' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'If ANY execute A else B' node belongs to the 'Logic' category. Its function is to execute 'IF_TRUE' if 'ANY' is True, otherwise it executes 'IF_FALSE'."
