        "question": "What is the class name of the Filter Contour node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Filter Contour node in ComfyUI is `Filter Contour`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the Filter Contour node be found?",
        "answer": "The Filter Contour node can be found in the category `Bmad/CV/Contour`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Filter Contour node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Filter Contour node include `contours` (Collection of contours to be filtered, dtype: `CV_CONTOURS`), `fitness` (Custom fitness function, dtype: `STRING`), and `select` (Selection criteria, dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `contours` input in the Filter Contour node?",
        "answer": "The `contours` input in the Filter Contour node provides the raw data, consisting of contours to be filtered and processed according to the fitness function and selection criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `fitness` input parameter of the Filter Contour node represent?",
        "answer": "The `fitness` input parameter of the Filter Contour node represents a custom fitness function used to evaluate each contour, which is crucial for determining which contours are selected for output based on their fitness scores."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `select` input parameter in the Filter Contour node?",
        "answer": "The `select` input parameter in the Filter Contour node is used to dictate the selection criteria, which determines how the filtered contours are chosen for output after being evaluated by the fitness function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Filter Contour node and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Filter Contour node are `cv_contour` (A single selected contour, dtype: `CV_CONTOUR`) and `cv_contours` (All contours that were evaluated and potentially filtered, dtype: `CV_CONTOURS`), representing respectively the primary selected contour and all contours that were evaluated and potentially filtered."
