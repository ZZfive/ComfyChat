        "question": "What is the FL_Glitch node?",
        "answer": "The FL_Glitch node is a custom node in ComfyUI that applies a digital glitch effect to images, optionally incorporating color offsets and controlled by a seed for reproducibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the FL_Glitch node belong to?",
        "answer": "The FL_Glitch node belongs to the 'Fill Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' parameter expect in the FL_Glitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in the FL_Glitch node expects a collection of images to which the glitch effect will be applied. These images are in the form of a List of torch.Tensor objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the intensity of the glitch effect controlled in FL_Glitch?",
        "answer": "The intensity of the glitch effect in the FL_Glitch node is controlled by the 'glitch_amount' parameter. This parameter determines the extent of the visual distortion applied to the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'color_offset' parameter play in the FL_Glitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'color_offset' parameter in the FL_Glitch node is responsible for enabling or disabling color offsetting in the glitch effect, thereby adding an extra layer of visual manipulation to the processed images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the 'seed' parameter important in the FL_Glitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter in the FL_Glitch node ensures the reproducibility of the glitch effects applied to the images. It guarantees consistent results across different runs by controlling the randomness of the glitching process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the FL_Glitch node?",
        "answer": "The FL_Glitch node outputs a tensor of images that have been processed to include a digital glitch effect. This output tensor is of type IMAGE in ComfyUI and is represented as a torch.Tensor object in Python."
