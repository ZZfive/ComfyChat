        "question": "What is the VAELoader node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAELoader node in ComfyUI is designed for loading Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models, specifically tailored to handle both standard and approximate VAEs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which VAE models does VAELoader have specialized handling for?",
        "answer": "VAELoader has specialized handling for 'taesd' and 'taesdxl' models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the vae_name parameter specify in the VAELoader node?",
        "answer": "The vae_name parameter specifies the name of the VAE to be loaded, determining which VAE model is fetched and loaded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does the vae_name parameter have in VAELoader?",
        "answer": "The vae_name parameter in VAELoader has the Python dtype `str`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VAELoader node return as output and what is its dtype?",
        "answer": "The VAELoader node returns the loaded VAE model as output, with the Comfy dtype `VAE` and Python dtype `comfy.sd.VAE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes does VAELoader commonly work with in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "VAELoader commonly works with nodes such as VAEDecode, VAEEncode, Reroute, CR Module Pipe Loader, VAEDecodeTiled, KSampler Adv. (Efficient), FaceDetailer, Anything Everywhere3, and VAEEncodeTiled in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VAELoader determine if 'taesd' and 'taesdxl' are available?",
        "answer": "VAELoader determines if 'taesd' and 'taesdxl' are available by checking the presence of both an encoder and a decoder for each of these models in the VAE approximations list."
