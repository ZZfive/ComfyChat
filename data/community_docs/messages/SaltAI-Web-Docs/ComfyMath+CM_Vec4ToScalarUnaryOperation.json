        "question": "What is CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs unary operations on a 4-dimensional vector (Vec4) to produce a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec4' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation requires two input types: 'op', which specifies the unary operation to perform, and 'a', which is the Vec4 input for the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation is 'float', which is obtained from applying the unary operation on the Vec4 input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation emphasize?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ToScalarUnaryOperation emphasizes its ability to abstract and reduce vectorial data into a simpler form by performing operations on Vec4."
