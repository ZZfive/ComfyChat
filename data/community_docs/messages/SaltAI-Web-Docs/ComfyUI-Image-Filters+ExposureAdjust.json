        "question": "What is the ExposureAdjust node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExposureAdjust node in ComfyUI is used for modifying the exposure of images by adjusting their brightness levels, supporting different input and output color modes and optional tonemapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' input parameter in the ExposureAdjust node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input parameter in the ExposureAdjust node represents the input images to be adjusted for exposure, defining the visual content that will undergo exposure correction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'stops' parameter in the ExposureAdjust node function?",
        "answer": "The 'stops' parameter in the ExposureAdjust node determines the exposure adjustment level; positive values increase exposure (making the image brighter), while negative values decrease it (making the image darker)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'input_mode' and 'output_mode' parameters in the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The 'input_mode' and 'output_mode' parameters in the ExposureAdjust node specify the color space of the input and output images, respectively, allowing for adjustments in 'sRGB' or 'linear', affecting how exposure adjustments are applied and flexibility in integrating the adjusted images into various workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'use_tonemap' parameter play in the ExposureAdjust node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_tonemap' parameter in the ExposureAdjust node is a boolean flag that indicates whether tonemapping should be applied to the images, which is useful for handling high dynamic range content."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'tonemap_scale' parameter affect the ExposureAdjust output?",
        "answer": "The 'tonemap_scale' parameter in the ExposureAdjust node adjusts the scale of the tonemapping effect, providing control over the dynamic range compression of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ExposureAdjust node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the ExposureAdjust node in ComfyUI is the output images with adjusted exposure, potentially in a different color space and with optional tonemapping applied."
