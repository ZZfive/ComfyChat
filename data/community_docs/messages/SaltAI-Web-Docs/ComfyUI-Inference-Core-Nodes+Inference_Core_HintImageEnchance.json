    {
        "question": "What input type does the hint_image in Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance represent?",
        "answer": "The hint_image in Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance is the hint image to be processed for better suitability in image generation tasks, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the resize_mode input parameter allow for in the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "The resize_mode input parameter allows for the selection of the resizing mode to be applied, determining how the hint image is adjusted to fit the target dimensions, with a Python dtype of `ResizeMode`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What processing does the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node offer for hint images?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node offers preprocessing for hint images, including enhancements like binary thresholding, edge detection, and inpainting based on the image's alpha channel, and resizing to fit within specified dimensions using various modes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node is an `IMAGE` type, representing the processed hint images that have been enhanced and resized, ready for use in image generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which method in the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node is used for executing the processing of the hint images?",
        "answer": "The execute method, specifically `execute(hint_image, image_gen_width, image_gen_height, resize_mode)`, is used in the Inference_Core_HintImageEnchance node for executing the processing of the hint images."
