        "question": "What is the purpose of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is designed to insert images at specified indices into an original batch of images, effectively modifying the original sequence by adding new images at the designated positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node are the original_images (represented as IMAGE with a comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor), images_to_insert (also IMAGE), and indexes (STRING to indicate comma-separated indices)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node handle the insertion of images into an existing image batch?",
        "answer": "The InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node handles the insertion of images into an existing image batch by taking a string of comma-separated indices indicating where in the original batch the new images should be inserted, then modifying the batch according to these positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the indexes input parameter in the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node represent?",
        "answer": "The indexes input parameter in the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node represents a string of comma-separated indices indicating where in the original batch the new images should be inserted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is IMAGE, representing the modified batch of images after the insertion of new images at specified indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used to modify the original sequence of images by adding new images at designated positions in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node can be used to modify the original sequence of images by adding new images at designated positions, achieving dynamic manipulation of image batches."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node categorized within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImagesToBatchIndexed node is categorized under KJNodes/image in ComfyUI, indicating its relation to image manipulation."
