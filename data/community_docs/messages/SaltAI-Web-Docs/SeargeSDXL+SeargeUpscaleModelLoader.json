        "question": "What is the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node in ComfyUI is designed to load upscale models by name, facilitating the dynamic selection and utilization of different upscaling algorithms or models for image enhancement tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node provide?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node outputs an upscale_model, which is of type UPSCALE_MODEL and is ready for use in upscaling tasks. The output model is a torch.nn.Module in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter required by the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node requires the upscaler_name input parameter, which specifies the name of the upscaler model to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for identifying and retrieving the correct model for image enhancement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for the upscaler_name input in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for the upscaler_name input in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is UPSCALER_NAME, and its Python dtype is str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for loading upscale models in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node uses the UpscaleModelLoader class from the comfy_extras.nodes_upscale_model module to load upscale models by name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that performs the actual upscaler model loading in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node?",
        "answer": "The function responsible for loading the upscaler model in the SeargeUpscaleModelLoader node is the load_upscaler function."
