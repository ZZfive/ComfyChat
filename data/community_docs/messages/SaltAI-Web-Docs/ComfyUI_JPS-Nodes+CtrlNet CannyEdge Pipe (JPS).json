    {
        "question": "Which algorithm does the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe (JPS) node apply for edge detection?",
        "answer": "The CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe (JPS) node applies the Canny Edge detection algorithm for edge detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cannyedge_settings' input specify in the context of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'cannyedge_settings' input specifies the configuration for Canny Edge detection including source, strength, start and end positions, and low and high threshold values, which is crucial for determining how the edge detection is performed and its sensitivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "In terms of funciton, what does the 'give_values' method do for the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'give_values' method of the CtrlNet CannyEdge Pipe (JPS) node takes the 'cannyedge_settings' as input and returns the specific parameters for Canny Edge detection such as source, strength, start, end positions, and threshold values."
