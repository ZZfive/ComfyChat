        "question": "What is the class name of the node that creates a uniform mask with a specified constant value?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node is `Constant Mask`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the Constant Mask node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Constant Mask node falls under the category `Masquerade Nodes`."

        "question": "What is the output node type of the Constant Mask node?",
        "answer": "The output node type of the Constant Mask node is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the constant value to fill the mask in the Constant Mask node?",
        "answer": "The input `value` specifies the constant value to fill the mask."

    {
        "question": "How does the Constant Mask node determine the dimensions of the mask when `copy_image_size` is provided?",
        "answer": "If `copy_image_size` is provided, the Constant Mask node uses the dimensions of the given image to determine the size of the generated mask, overriding explicit dimensions if provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the required inputs of the Constant Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types for the required inputs are `float` for `value`, and `int` for `explicit_height` and `explicit_width`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Constant Mask node output if no explicit dimensions or `copy_image_size` are provided?",
        "answer": "If no explicit dimensions or `copy_image_size` are provided, the Constant Mask node outputs a tiny mask of dimensions 16x16, which can be resized later in the pipeline."
