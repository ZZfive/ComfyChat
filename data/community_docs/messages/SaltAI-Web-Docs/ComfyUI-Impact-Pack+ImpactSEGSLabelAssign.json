        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node in ComfyUI is designed to assign user-defined labels to segments (SEGS) within a dataset, enhancing data annotation and organization for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node are 'segs' (segments to which labels will be assigned) and 'labels' (a list of labels to be assigned to the segments)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node is 'SEGS', which represents the segments with newly assigned labels."

        "question": "What is the role of the 'labels' input in the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node?",
        "answer": "The 'labels' input in the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node provides a comma-separated string of labels that are to be assigned to the segments, enhancing data categorization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node handle the case where the number of labels does not match the number of segments?",
        "answer": "If the length of the labels does not match the length of the segments, the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node will issue a warning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'segs' input in the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'segs' input in the ImpactSEGSLabelAssign node is `Tuple[str, List[Any]]`."
