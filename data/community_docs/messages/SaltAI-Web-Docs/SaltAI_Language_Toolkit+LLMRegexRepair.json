        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMRegexRepair node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMRegexRepair node in ComfyUI is designed to correct and improve regex patterns based on a given description of their intended functionality and any additional directions, aiming to transform potentially malformed or incorrect regex expressions into well-formed patterns that accurately match the specified criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the LLMRegexRepair node belong to in ComfyUI's node library?",
        "answer": "The LLMRegexRepair node belongs to the category `SALT/Language Toolkit/Tools/Regex` in ComfyUI's node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMRegexRepair node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMRegexRepair node in ComfyUI are `llm_model`, `text_input`, and `description`, representing the language model, the potentially malformed or incorrect regex pattern, and a description of what the regex pattern is intended to match, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `llm_model` represent in the input of LLMRegexRepair, and what is its type in ComfyUI and Python?",
        "answer": "`llm_model` represents the language model used for repairing the regex pattern, and its type in ComfyUI is `LLM_MODEL`, and in Python, it is `dict`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for LLMRegexRepair and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for LLMRegexRepair are `extra_directions`, which represent additional instructions or constraints to guide the language model in repairing the regex pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LLMRegexRepair utilize the language model to repair regex patterns?",
        "answer": "LLMRegexRepair utilizes the language model by interpreting the input pattern and generating a corrected version based on the description provided and any extra directions, producing a repaired regex pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LLMRegexRepair node, and what is its type in ComfyUI and Python?",
        "answer": "The output of the LLMRegexRepair node is `repaired_regex_pattern`, which is the corrected regex pattern generated by the language model, and its type in ComfyUI is `STRING`, and in Python, it is `str`."
