        "question": "What is the purpose of the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node in ComfyUI is designed for object detection and segmentation in images, combining bounding box detection with segmentation mask creation and optional dilation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node include 'bbox_detector' (BBOX_DETECTOR type), 'image' (IMAGE type), 'threshold' (FLOAT type), and 'dilation' (INT type)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for specifying the bounding box model in the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'bbox_detector' input is responsible for specifying the bounding box model in the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the extent of dilation in the segmentation masks generated by BboxDetectorCombined_v2?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' input determines the extent to which the segmentation masks are dilated in the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node, enhancing the mask's coverage over the detected objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node falls under the category 'ImpactPack/Detector' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node generate?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorCombined_v2 node generates a 'mask' output which is a segmentation mask representing detected objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of device does BboxDetectorCombined_v2 primarily run?",
        "answer": "BboxDetectorCombined_v2 primarily runs on a GPU, as indicated by its infra type."
