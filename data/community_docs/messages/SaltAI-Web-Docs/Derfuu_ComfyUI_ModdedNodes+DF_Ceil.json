        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Ceil node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node rounds up a given floating-point number to the nearest integer, implementing the mathematical ceiling function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category under which the DF_Ceil node falls in the ComfyUI node tree?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node falls under the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Functions/Converters` in the ComfyUI node tree."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for the DF_Ceil node to determine its output?",
        "answer": "The crucial input for the DF_Ceil node is the `Value` input, specifying the floating-point number to be rounded up to its nearest integer value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `Value` input in the DF_Ceil node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `Value` input in the DF_Ceil node is `FLOAT` in ComfyUI and `float` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the DF_Ceil node output as a result of its operation?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node outputs an integer (`INT` in ComfyUI, `int` in Python) that is the result of rounding up the input floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which type of infrastructure can the DF_Ceil node be typically used?",
        "answer": "The DF_Ceil node can typically be used in CPU-based infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Ceil node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Ceil node is not an output node."
