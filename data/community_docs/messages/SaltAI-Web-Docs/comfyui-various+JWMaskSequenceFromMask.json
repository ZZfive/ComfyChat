        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceFromMask node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a given mask into a mask sequence, allowing for the batch processing of masks by replicating the input mask across a specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceFromMask node belongs to the 'jamesWalker55' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node are 'mask', which is the input mask to be transformed, and 'batch_size', which specifies the number of times the input mask should be replicated in the resulting mask sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the mask replicated by the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node?",
        "answer": "The mask is replicated by reshaping it to (1, 1, *mask.shape) and then repeating this shape across the 'batch_size' specified, resulting in a mask sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node and what is its type?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node is 'mask_sequence', which is a sequence of masks, and its type is 'MASK_SEQUENCE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node designed for?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskSequenceFromMask node is designed for 'GPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name called by the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node to execute its operation?",
        "answer": "The function name called by the JWMaskSequenceFromMask node to execute its operation is 'execute'."
