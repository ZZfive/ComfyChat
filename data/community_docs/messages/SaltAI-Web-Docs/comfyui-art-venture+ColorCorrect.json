        "question": "What are the color properties that can be adjusted using the ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI allows users to adjust the temperature, hue, brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI adjust the color temperature of an image?",
        "answer": "The ColorCorrect node adjusts the color temperature of an image by allowing the user to input a temperature value, making the image warmer or cooler based on this setting."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type of the ColorCorrect node is responsible for altering the hue of an image?",
        "answer": "The input type of the ColorCorrect node that is responsible for altering the hue of an image is the hue input, indicated by the 'hue' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the ColorCorrect node use for its inputs, specifically for the image tensor?",
        "answer": "The ColorCorrect node uses the 'IMAGE' data type for the input image tensor, which corresponds to a 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "When using the ColorCorrect node, which of the common nodes can be used for previewing the color corrections made to the image?",
        "answer": "When using the ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI, the PreviewImage node can be used for previewing the color corrections made to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI and in what format is it returned?",
        "answer": "The output of the ColorCorrect node in ComfyUI is the color-corrected image tensor, which is returned in the 'IMAGE' data format, corresponding to a 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
