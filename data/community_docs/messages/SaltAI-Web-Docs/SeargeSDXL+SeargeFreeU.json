        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeFreeU node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeFreeU node in ComfyUI is designed to configure and apply specific settings for the FreeU mode in a generative model's processing pipeline, allowing for dynamic adjustment of parameters to enhance the model's output through fine-tuned control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeargeFreeU node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeargeFreeU node include `freeu_mode`, `b1`, `b2`, `s1`, `s2`, and `freeu_version`. These parameters specify the mode of operation for FreeU, control various aspects of its behavior, and determine the version of FreeU to be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `freeu_mode` parameter influence the operation of SeargeFreeU in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `freeu_mode` parameter in SeargeFreeU influences how other parameters are set and ultimately affects the output of the generative model in ComfyUI. It specifies the mode of operation for FreeU, impacting the fine-tuning of the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the SeargeFreeU node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the SeargeFreeU node is `data`, which is an optional data stream for further processing or modification within the FreeU mode, allowing for extended customization and flexibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `data` input expect in the SeargeFreeU node?",
        "answer": "The `data` input in the SeargeFreeU node expects a `SRG_DATA_STREAM` type of data, which is a dictionary-like structure that can carry additional information for extended processing or modification within the FreeU mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `SeargeFreeU` class return after processing the inputs?",
        "answer": "After processing the inputs, the `SeargeFreeU` class returns a modified data stream of type `SRG_DATA_STREAM`, enriched or altered by the FreeU settings applied, ready for subsequent stages in the processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `freeu_version` input in the SeargeFreeU node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `freeu_version` input in the SeargeFreeU node is a `COMBO[STRING]` type, which determines the version of FreeU to be applied, directly influencing the behavior of other parameters and the overall effect on the model's output."
