    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `save_prefix` input in the EasyKSampler node?",
        "answer": "The `save_prefix` input in the EasyKSampler node is used to define the prefix for filenames when saving generated images, facilitating organized storage. Its Comfy dtype is `STRING`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input does the EasyKSampler node have that affects the characteristics and quality of the generated images?",
        "answer": "The EasyKSampler node has an optional input `model` which influences the characteristics and quality of the generated images. The model used for the diffusion process is central to determining these aspects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `final_image` output in the EasyKSampler node represent?",
        "answer": "The `final_image` output in the EasyKSampler node represents the final image result after the layer diffusion process. It showcases the applied blending and detailing effects and is of the Comfy dtype `IMAGE`."
