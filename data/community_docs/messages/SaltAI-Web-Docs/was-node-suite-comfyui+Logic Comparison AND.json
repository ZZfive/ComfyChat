        "question": "What is the Logic Comparison AND node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison AND node in ComfyUI is part of the WAS Suite/Logic category and performs a logical AND operation on two boolean inputs, returning the result as a boolean output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for the Logic Comparison AND node?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison AND node requires two inputs: `boolean_a` and `boolean_b`. Both inputs must be of the boolean type in order to perform the AND operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of boolean_a in the Logic Comparison AND node?",
        "answer": "boolean_a is the first boolean input for the AND operation in the Logic Comparison AND node. Its value significantly influences the outcome, as the operation requires both inputs to be true for a true result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of boolean_b in the Logic Comparison AND node?",
        "answer": "boolean_b is the second boolean input for the AND operation in the Logic Comparison AND node. It, along with boolean_a, determines the result of the AND operation, which is true only if both inputs are true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Logic Comparison AND node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the Logic Comparison AND node is the boolean result of the logical AND operation between `boolean_a` and `boolean_b`. The output is of BOOLEAN type both in ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the Logic Comparison AND node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Comparison AND node can be found in the WAS Suite/Logic category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the logic comparison AND operation implemented in the Logic Comparison AND node?",
        "answer": "The logic comparison AND operation in the Logic Comparison AND node is implemented through the Python code `return (boolean_a and boolean_b,)`, where `boolean_a` and `boolean_b` are the two input boolean values."
