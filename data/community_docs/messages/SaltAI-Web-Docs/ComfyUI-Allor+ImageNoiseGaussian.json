        "question": "What is ImageNoiseGaussian?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseGaussian is a node in ComfyUI that applies Gaussian noise to images with options to adjust noise strength, apply noise monochromatically, and invert the noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageNoiseGaussian node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageNoiseGaussian node applies Gaussian noise to input images, allowing adjustment of noise strength, monochromatic application, and optionally inverting the noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ImageNoiseGaussian?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseGaussian requires inputs including 'images' (input images for noise application), 'strength' (noise strength adjustment), 'monochromatic' (boolean for monochromatic noise application), 'invert' (boolean for inverting noise effect), and 'channels' (specifies which image channels to apply noise to)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseGaussian handle monochromatic noise?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseGaussian applies monochromatic noise by adjusting the noise across all channels uniformly if the 'monochromatic' option is enabled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'strength' parameter in ImageNoiseGaussian?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'strength' parameter in ImageNoiseGaussian is float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseGaussian apply noise inversion?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseGaussian applies noise inversion by subtracting the noise from the images if the 'invert' option is enabled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of ImageNoiseGaussian?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseGaussian belongs to the 'image/noise' category in ComfyUI."
