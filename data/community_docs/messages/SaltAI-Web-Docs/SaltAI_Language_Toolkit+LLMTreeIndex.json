        "question": "What is the class name for the node that constructs an index structure from language model nodes?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node that constructs an index structure from language model nodes is `LLMTreeIndex`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the LLMTreeIndex node belong?",
        "answer": "The LLMTreeIndex node belongs to the category `SALT/Language Toolkit/Indexing`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `LLMTreeIndex` node?",
        "answer": "The LLMTreeIndex node is designed to construct an index structure from a set of language model nodes, facilitating efficient querying and retrieval of information."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the language model used for constructing the index?",
        "answer": "The input that controls the language model used for constructing the index is `llm_model`, which has a Comfy dtype of `LLM_MODEL` and a Python dtype of `str`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `llm_nodes` input in the `LLMTreeIndex` node?",
        "answer": "The `llm_nodes` input defines the set of nodes to be indexed and represents the data structure that the tree index will organize and make searchable."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the breadth of the `LLMTreeIndex` tree be influenced?",
        "answer": "The breadth of the `LLMTreeIndex` tree can be influenced by the `num_children` input, which determines the maximum number of child nodes each node in the tree can have."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `build_tree` input in the `LLMTreeIndex` node control?",
        "answer": "The `build_tree` input in the `LLMTreeIndex` node is a flag that controls whether the tree structure should be constructed, allowing for flexibility in how the index is generated."
