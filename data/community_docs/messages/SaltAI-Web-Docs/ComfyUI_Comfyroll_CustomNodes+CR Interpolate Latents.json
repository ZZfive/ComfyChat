        "question": "What is the CR Interpolate Latents node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The CR Interpolate Latents node in ComfyUI is used for blending two latent representations based on a specified interpolation method, such as linear or spherical linear, to facilitate smooth transitions or animations in a generative model's latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CR Interpolate Latents node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CR Interpolate Latents node are `latent1` and `latent2`, representing the start and end latent representations, a scalar `weight` to determine the interpolation ratio, and a `method` specifying the interpolation technique, such as 'lerp' for linear or 'slerp' for spherical linear interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `method` input in CR Interpolate Latents control?",
        "answer": "The `method` input in CR Interpolate Latents controls the interpolation method used between the two latent representations. It accepts 'lerp' for linear interpolation or 'slerp' for spherical linear interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to interpolate latent spaces?",
        "answer": "The CR Interpolate Latents node in ComfyUI can be used to interpolate latent spaces by blending two latent representations using a chosen interpolation method such as linear or spherical linear interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find additional information and guidance on the interpolation methods in ComfyUI CR Interpolate Latents node?",
        "answer": "Additional information and guidance on the interpolation methods available in the CR Interpolate Latents node in ComfyUI can be found at the URL provided in the `show_help` output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the CR Interpolate Latents node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Interpolate Latents node outputs the resulting latent representation after applying the specified interpolation method and a `show_help` string that contains a URL for additional information on interpolation methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the `latent1` input in CR Interpolate Latents?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the `latent1` input in CR Interpolate Latents is `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
