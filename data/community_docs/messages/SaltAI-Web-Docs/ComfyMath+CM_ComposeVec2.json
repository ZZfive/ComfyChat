        "question": "What is the CM_ComposeVec2 node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CM_ComposeVec2 node is designed to construct a 2-dimensional vector from individual scalar components, facilitating the conversion of separate scalar values into a structured vector format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input parameters of the CM_ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The input parameters of the CM_ComposeVec2 node are 'x' and 'y', representing the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the 2-dimensional vector, respectively. Both are Comfy dtype 'FLOAT' and Python dtype 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x' parameter represent in the CM_ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'x' parameter in the CM_ComposeVec2 node represents the x-coordinate of the 2-dimensional vector, defining the vector's horizontal component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'y' parameter represent in the CM_ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'y' parameter in the CM_ComposeVec2 node represents the y-coordinate of the 2-dimensional vector, essential for defining the vector's vertical component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CM_ComposeVec2 node provide?",
        "answer": "The CM_ComposeVec2 node outputs a 2-dimensional vector constructed from the input scalar values, encapsulating both the horizontal and vertical components. This is represented as the Comfy dtype 'VEC2' and Python dtype 'tuple[Vec2]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for the CM_ComposeVec2 node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for the CM_ComposeVec2 node is 'CPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is CM_ComposeVec2 an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, CM_ComposeVec2 is not an output node; it serves to construct 2-dimensional vectors from scalar inputs."
