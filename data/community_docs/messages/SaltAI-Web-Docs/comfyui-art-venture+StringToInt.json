        "question": "What is the purpose of the StringToInt class in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StringToInt class is designed to convert a string representation of a number into its integer form, providing a straightforward way to parse and utilize numerical data represented as text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the StringToInt class?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the StringToInt class is a `STRING` which represents the numerical data in text form that needs to be converted into an integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'string' input parameter in the StringToInt node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'string' input parameter in the StringToInt node represents the numerical data in text form that needs to be converted into an integer, which is crucial for the conversion process, determining the numerical value that will be returned."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the StringToInt node generate?",
        "answer": "The StringToInt node generates an output of type `INT` which is the integer representation of the input string, allowing for numerical operations and processing within the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Comfy dtype' refer to in the context of the StringToInt node's inputs and outputs?",
        "answer": "The 'Comfy dtype' refers to the data type as understood and processed by the ComfyUI system. For the StringToInt node, input is of type `STRING` and output is of type `INT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the StringToInt node belong to in the ComfyUI node library?",
        "answer": "The StringToInt node belongs to the 'Art Venture/Utils' category in the ComfyUI node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the StringToInt node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StringToInt node is not an output node; it is an internal node designed for data conversion."
