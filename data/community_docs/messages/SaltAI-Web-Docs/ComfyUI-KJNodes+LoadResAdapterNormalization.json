        "question": "What is the purpose of the LoadResAdapterNormalization node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadResAdapterNormalization node in ComfyUI is designed to load and apply ResAdapter normalization weights to a given model, ensuring its compatibility with specific normalization standards by patching it with ResAdapter weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the LoadResAdapterNormalization node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadResAdapterNormalization node belongs to the 'KJNodes/experimental' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the LoadResAdapterNormalization node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LoadResAdapterNormalization node are 'model' (torch.nn.Module) and 'resadapter_path' (str), which represent the base model to be enhanced and the file path to the ResAdapter normalization weights, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model' parameter in the LoadResAdapterNormalization node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter in the LoadResAdapterNormalization node is crucial as it determines the base model that will be enhanced with normalization patches. It is the model to which ResAdapter normalization weights will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LoadResAdapterNormalization node output?",
        "answer": "The LoadResAdapterNormalization node outputs a cloned model with applied ResAdapter normalization patches. This output is significant as it represents the enhanced version of the original model, ready for further use or evaluation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are designed to enhance model compatibility with normalization standards by patching with ResAdapter weights?",
        "answer": "The LoadResAdapterNormalization node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance model compatibility with normalization standards by patching it with ResAdapter weights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the 'model' and 'resadapter_path' input types in the LoadResAdapterNormalization node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'model' input type in the LoadResAdapterNormalization node is 'torch.nn.Module', and for the 'resadapter_path' input type, it is 'str'."
