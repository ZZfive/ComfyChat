        "question": "What is the Image Blend by Mask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend by Mask node in ComfyUI is designed to blend two images together based on a mask and a specified blend percentage, allowing for the creation of composite images with selective blending according to the mask's pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `mask` input in Image Blend by Mask?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input in Image Blend by Mask is a mask image that determines the blending pattern between the two images. Areas in white allow the second image to show through, while black areas retain the first image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `image` output of the Image Blend by Mask node described?",
        "answer": "The `image` output of Image Blend by Mask is the resulting image after blending the two input images based on the mask and blend percentage, with the Comfy data type of `IMAGE` and the Python data type of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Blend by Mask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Blend by Mask node include `image_a`, the first image to be blended serving as the base layer; `image_b`, the second image to be blended according to the mask and blend percentage; `mask`, the mask image determining the blending pattern; and `blend_percentage`, a float value specifying the percentage of blending between the two images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `blend_percentage` input control in the Image Blend by Mask node?",
        "answer": "The `blend_percentage` input in Image Blend by Mask controls the percentage of blending between the two images, with a higher value increasing the visibility of the second image in the blended result, and the data types for this input are Comfy dtype: `FLOAT` and Python dtype: `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used for blending two images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend by Mask node can be used for blending two images in ComfyUI, offering control over the blending process based on a mask and a blend percentage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the Image Blend by Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Blend by Mask node belongs to the `WAS Suite/Image` category in ComfyUI."
