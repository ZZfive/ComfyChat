        "question": "What is the purpose of the Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically evaluate Python expressions using string variables, allowing for the execution of simple arithmetic or functional expressions by substituting string values for variables within the expression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Evaluate Strings node is `Evaluate Strings`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category for the Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category for the Evaluate Strings node in ComfyUI is `Efficiency Nodes/Simple Eval`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Evaluate Strings node is `string`, with Comfy dtype as `STRING` and Python dtype as `str`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'python_expression' input work in the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The 'python_expression' input in the Evaluate Strings node specifies the Python expression to be evaluated. This expression can include arithmetic operations or functions, with variables that will be replaced by their corresponding string values provided in other inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of the 'print_to_console' input on the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "The 'print_to_console' input in the Evaluate Strings node controls whether the evaluation result and variable values are printed to the console, which is crucial for debugging or when visual confirmation of the process is needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of altering the string values of 'a', 'b', or 'c' on the outcome of the Evaluate Strings node?",
        "answer": "Altering the string values of 'a', 'b', or 'c' changes the outcome of the expression, demonstrating their direct impact on the node's execution and results."
