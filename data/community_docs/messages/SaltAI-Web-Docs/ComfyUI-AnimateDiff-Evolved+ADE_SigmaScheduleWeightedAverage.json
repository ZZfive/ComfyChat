        "question": "What is ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to create a new sigma schedule by calculating a weighted average of two provided sigma schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage?",
        "answer": "The purpose of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage is to blend characteristics from two sigma schedules into a new schedule based on a specified weighting factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage requires inputs such as 'schedule_A' and 'schedule_B', which are SIGMA_SCHEDULE types, and 'weight_A', which is a FLOAT type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage calculate the resulting sigma schedule?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage calculates the resulting sigma schedule by multiplying the sigmas of 'schedule_A' by 'weight_A' and the sigmas of 'schedule_B' by '(1-weight_A)', then blending these results into a new schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage?",
        "answer": "The output type of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverage is a SIGMA_SCHEDULE."
