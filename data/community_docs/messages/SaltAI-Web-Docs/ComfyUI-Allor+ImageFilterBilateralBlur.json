        "question": "What is ImageFilterBilateralBlur?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterBilateralBlur is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to apply a bilateral filter to images, reducing noise while maintaining sharp edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBilateralBlur node applies a bilateral filter to images, which considers both spatial proximity and pixel value differences to reduce noise while preserving edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The ImageFilterBilateralBlur node requires inputs such as 'images', 'size', 'sigma_color', and 'sigma_intensity'. These inputs define the images to be processed, the size of the pixel neighborhood, and parameters controlling color and intensity influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'size' input affect the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The 'size' input specifies the diameter of the pixel neighborhood used during filtering in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node. A larger size includes more pixels, potentially leading to stronger smoothing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of 'sigma_color' in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "'sigma_color' in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node controls how much an image's color space influences the bilateral filter. Higher values allow pixels with larger intensity differences to influence each other more."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'sigma_intensity' impact the output of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "'sigma_intensity' in the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node determines the range of intensity differences that will influence bilateral filtering. Higher values increase the impact of intensity differences among pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImageFilterBilateralBlur node is a processed image that has undergone bilateral blur filtering, aiming to reduce noise while keeping edges sharp."
