        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node is designed to adjust the luminance of an image based on ControlNet preprocessing techniques, utilizing gamma correction to enhance image quality or prepare it for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node require to process for luminance adjustment?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node requires an input image with comfy dtype IMAGE and python dtype numpy.ndarray to be processed for luminance adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the gamma_correction factor affect the image processed by Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector?",
        "answer": "The gamma_correction factor in the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node adjusts the image's luminance; a higher value brightens the image, while a lower value darkens it, impacting the overall image processing outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can one specify with the resolution input in the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node?",
        "answer": "With the resolution input in the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node, one can specify the resolution for the output image, influencing the level of detail and size of the processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node output after processing an image?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector node outputs an image with adjusted luminance after processing, with comfy dtype IMAGE and python dtype numpy.ndarray."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector falls under the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing does the Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector perform on images?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ImageLuminanceDetector performs luminance adjustment on images using gamma correction, part of the ControlNet preprocessing techniques in ComfyUI."
