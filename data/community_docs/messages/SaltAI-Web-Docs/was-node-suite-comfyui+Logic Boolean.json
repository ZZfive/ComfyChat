        "question": "What is the Logic Boolean node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Boolean node is designed to process boolean inputs, performing basic logical operations or conversions based on the specified function. It facilitates decision-making processes and data flow control in workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Logic Boolean node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Logic Boolean node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Logic` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'boolean_number' input in the Logic Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The 'boolean_number' input in the Logic Boolean node has a Comfy dtype of `FLOAT` and a Python dtype of `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the Logic Boolean node provide?",
        "answer": "The Logic Boolean node provides outputs of types `NUMBER` and `INT`, both encapsulating the result of the logical operation or conversion in numerical format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `number` output in the Logic Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The `number` output in the Logic Boolean node represents the numerical result of the logical operation or conversion performed and encapsulates the outcome in a numerical format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type is associated with the `int` output of the Logic Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The `int` output of the Logic Boolean node has a Python dtype of `int`, providing an integer representation of the logical operation or conversion result."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used alongside the Logic Boolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "A common node used alongside the Logic Boolean node in ComfyUI is the `Image Input Switch`."
