        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for preprocessing images to generate fake scribble lines, simulating the appearance of hand-drawn scribbles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node belongs to the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'safe' mode in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'safe' mode in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node is a mode selector that enables or disables safety features during the image processing, affecting the final appearance of the scribble lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node output?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node outputs a processed image with fake scribble lines, representing a stylized version of the original input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of changing the 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Changing the 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the image processing should be performed, impacting the detail level of the generated scribble lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model does the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node use to generate fake scribble lines?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node uses a modified HED edge detection model to create the fake scribble lines, offering an alternative to traditional edge detection methods for artistic and creative applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fake scribble lines generated by Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node resemble?",
        "answer": "The fake scribble lines generated by the Inference_Core_FakeScribblePreprocessor node resemble hand-drawn scribbles, creating stylized line drawings that mimic the scribble effect."
