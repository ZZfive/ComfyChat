        "question": "What is the AlphaClean node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The AlphaClean node in ComfyUI is used for image preprocessing, specifically to enhance and clean image alpha channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which techniques does the AlphaClean node employ to refine the transparency and edges of images?",
        "answer": "The AlphaClean node employs techniques such as bilateral filtering, Gaussian blurring, and dynamic thresholding to refine the transparency and edges of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input specifies the radius for Gaussian blurring in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The input that specifies the radius for Gaussian blurring in the AlphaClean node is `radius`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines how much to fill holes in the alpha channel of an image in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The input that determines how much to fill holes in the alpha channel is `fill_holes`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `white_threshold` input in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `white_threshold` input is to set the threshold for considering a pixel as white, which aids in separating the foreground from the background in images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `extra_clip` input affect the image in the AlphaClean node?",
        "answer": "The `extra_clip` input applies an additional clipping factor to the image, which adjusts the intensity of the cleaning effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AlphaClean node and its format?",
        "answer": "The AlphaClean node outputs the processed images with cleaned and enhanced alpha channels, formatted as `IMAGE` type, represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
