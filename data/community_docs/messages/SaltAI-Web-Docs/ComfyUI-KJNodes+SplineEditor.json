        "question": "What is the SplineEditor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SplineEditor node is a graphical editor designed for creating and manipulating splines to generate various types of output data. It is particularly useful for applications requiring custom schedules, mask batches, or coordinate transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SplineEditor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SplineEditor node include `points_store`, `coordinates`, `mask_width`, `mask_height`, `points_to_sample`, `sampling_method`, `interpolation`, `tension`, and `repeat_output`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the SplineEditor node determines the sampling method for coordinates or schedules?",
        "answer": "The `sampling_method` input of the SplineEditor node determines the sampling method, either along the time axis for schedules or along the path for coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `points_store` input in the SplineEditor node?",
        "answer": "The `points_store` input stores the control points data, which is used for generating and manipulating the spline."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input of the SplineEditor node sets the maximum value for the output?",
        "answer": "The `max_value` input of the SplineEditor node sets the maximum value for the output, establishing an upper limit on the generated data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output data does the SplineEditor node provide?",
        "answer": "The SplineEditor node provides `mask`, `coord_str`, `float`, and `count` as output types, representing mask batches, a string of coordinates, a list of floats, pandas series, or tensors, and an integer count, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a user add a control point at the end of the spline in the SplineEditor node?",
        "answer": "A user can add a control point at the end of the spline by using the Shift + click operation in the SplineEditor node."
