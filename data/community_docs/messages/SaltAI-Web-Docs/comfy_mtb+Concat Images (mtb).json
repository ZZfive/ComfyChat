        "question": "What is the purpose of the Concat Images (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Concat Images (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to merge multiple tensor representations of images into a single batch tensor, optimizing computational efficiency and facilitating batch operations in image processing workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Concat Images (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Concat Images (mtb) node is `Concat Images (mtb)`, and it falls under the category `mtb/image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of setting the reverse input to True in the Concat Images (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "When the reverse input is set to True in the Concat Images (mtb) node, images are concatenated in reverse order. Otherwise, they are concatenated in the order they are received."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Concat Images (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Concat Images (mtb) node is `IMAGE`, which is a single tensor combining all input images into one batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Concat Images (mtb) node do with the original image data when merging multiple images?",
        "answer": "The Concat Images (mtb) node combines all input images into one batch, preserving the original image data while adjusting the batch size to accommodate all images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of operations is the Concat Images (mtb) node essential for?",
        "answer": "The Concat Images (mtb) node is essential for processing multiple images simultaneously, optimizing computational efficiency and facilitating batch operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what type of hardware does the Concat Images (mtb) node run?",
        "answer": "The Concat Images (mtb) node runs on GPU hardware, as indicated by the `Infra type: GPU` usage tip."
