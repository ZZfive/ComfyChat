        "question": "What is the 'Mask Fill Holes' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Fill Holes' node in ComfyUI is designed to fill in the regions of a mask where there are gaps or holes, creating a more solid and continuous mask area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is required by the 'Mask Fill Holes' node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Fill Holes' node requires a 'masks' input, which represents the mask or masks to be filled. This input determines the areas of the image that need processing to fill in gaps or holes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'masks' input use, and what is its Python data type?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' input uses the Comfy dtype 'MASK' and its Python data type is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the 'Mask Fill Holes' node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the 'Mask Fill Holes' node is 'MASKS', which represents the processed masks with filled regions, providing a more continuous and solid mask area suitable for further image manipulation or analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the output 'MASKS' of the 'Mask Fill Holes' node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the output 'MASKS' of the 'Mask Fill Holes' node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fill_region' function in the 'Mask Fill Holes' node do?",
        "answer": "The 'fill_region' function in the 'Mask Fill Holes' node fills the holes in the input masks, either for a single mask or multiple masks, returning the processed masks as a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the 'Mask Fill Holes' node require for operation?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Fill Holes' node requires an 'Infra type' of 'GPU' for operation."
