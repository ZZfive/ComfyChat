        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskRegionLabeling node is designed to label distinct regions within a mask, converting them into visually distinct areas based on connectivity, and outputting these labeled regions as a tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node is `masks`, which are the input masks to be labeled, where each mask is processed to identify and label connected regions based on the specified threshold(s)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional input for the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node is `threshold`, a list of threshold values to apply binary thresholding on the masks, crucial for separating the regions to be labeled."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output tensor of labeled regions generated by the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node?",
        "answer": "The output tensor of labeled regions is generated by assigning unique colors to each region within the mask, enhancing interpretability by distinguishing each region."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node and in what format is it provided?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node is `images`, provided as a torch.Tensor, containing the labeled regions with each uniquely colored to distinguish from others."
    },
    {
        "question": "What unique feature does the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node offer in terms of improving mask interpretability?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskRegionLabeling node enhances the interpretability of mask regions by converting distinct regions within a mask into visually distinct areas, assigning unique colors to each region."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the SaltMaskRegionLabeling node fall under in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskRegionLabeling node falls under the category `SALT/Masking/Filter` in ComfyUI's node list."
