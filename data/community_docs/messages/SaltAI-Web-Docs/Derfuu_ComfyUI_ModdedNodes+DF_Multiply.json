        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Multiply node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Multiply node in ComfyUI is designed to perform multiplication of two floating-point numbers, serving as a simple solution for calculating the product of two values in mathematical or computational workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the DF_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Multiply node requires two input types: `Value_A` and `Value_B`, both of which must be floating-point numbers represented as `FLOAT` in Comfy dtype and `float` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DF_Multiply node process the values `Value_A` and `Value_B`?",
        "answer": "The DF_Multiply node multiplies the two floating-point numbers `Value_A` and `Value_B` to generate a `FLOAT` output, which is the product of these two numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Multiply node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Multiply node is a floating-point number, denoted as `FLOAT` in Comfy dtype and `float` in Python dtype, representing the product of `Value_A` and `Value_B`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the DF_Multiply node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Multiply node falls under the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Math` in ComftyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of operation does the DF_Multiply node specifically perform?",
        "answer": "The DF_Multiply node specifically performs multiplication of two floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the DF_Multiply node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the DF_Multiply node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
