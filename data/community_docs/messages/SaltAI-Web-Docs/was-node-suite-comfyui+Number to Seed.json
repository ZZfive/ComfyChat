        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Number to Seed' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Seed' node in ComfyUI is used to convert a given number into a seed value, facilitating operations that require a seed for randomization or procedural generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the 'Number to Seed' node require?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Seed' node requires a number input, which is crucial as it directly determines the output seed value, and its Comfy dtype is 'NUMBER'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the 'Number to Seed' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Seed' node provides an output type of 'seed', which results from the conversion of the input number and is significant for operations requiring a seed for randomization or procedural generation, and its Comfy dtype is 'SEED'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name for the 'Number to Seed' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The function name for the 'Number to Seed' node in ComfyUI is 'number_to_seed'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is 'Number to Seed' a CPU or GPU-based node?",
        "answer": "'Number to Seed' is a CPU-based node as per its infra type specified in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of randomization operations can the 'Number to Seed' node facilitate?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Seed' node in ComfyUI can facilitate randomization or procedural generation operations that require a seed value for consistency and control across multiple executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the 'Number to Seed' node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number to Seed' node falls under the 'WAS Suite/Number/Operations' category in ComfyUI."
