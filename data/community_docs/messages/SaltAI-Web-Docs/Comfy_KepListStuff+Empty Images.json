        "question": "What is the Empty Images node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Empty Images node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a batch of empty images with specified dimensions and color, serving as a foundational tool for creating placeholder or background images in various image processing and generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Empty Images node?",
        "answer": "The Empty Images node does not have any required input types. However, it does have optional input types for `num_images`, `splits`, and `batch_size`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `num_images` parameter in the Input types of the Empty Images node work?",
        "answer": "The `num_images` parameter in the Empty Images node is used to specify the total number of images to generate, controlling the overall output volume when creating images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `splits` parameter control when using the Empty Images node?",
        "answer": "The `splits` parameter defines how the total number of generated images should be divided into separate batches or groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `batch_size` parameter in the Empty Images node?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of images to generate in a single batch, allowing for the creation of multiple images at once to optimize processing time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Empty Images node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Empty Images node is `Image`, which outputs a batch of images with the specified dimensions and color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `batch_tensor` in the Empty Images' source code?",
        "answer": "The `batch_tensor` in the Empty Images node's source code is used to create a tensor representing a batch of images, with dimensions specified for the batch size, image dimensions, and color channels."
