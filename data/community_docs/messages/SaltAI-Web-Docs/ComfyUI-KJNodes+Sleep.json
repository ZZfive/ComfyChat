        "question": "What does the Sleep node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node in ComfyUI delays the execution for the input amount of time, allowing for a pause in operations based on specified minutes and seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name associated with the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the Sleep node is `Sleep`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Sleep node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node falls under the category `KJNodes/misc` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node status of Sleep?",
        "answer": "The output node status of Sleep is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'input' in the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "The 'input' in the Sleep node is a placeholder input that is returned after the delay, ensuring the flow of data is maintained throughout the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for 'minutes' and 'seconds' in the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "The 'minutes' in the Sleep node is specified as an integer (Comfy dtype: `INT`, Python dtype: `int`) denoting the duration of the delay in whole minutes, and 'seconds' is specified as a float (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`) denoting the duration of the delay in fractional minutes (seconds), fine-tuning the total delay time in conjunction with minutes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Sleep node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Sleep node in ComfyUI is `*`, which returns the input data unchanged after the specified delay, serving as a pass-through with a time delay."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what type of infra does the Sleep node operate?",
        "answer": "The Sleep node operates on `CPU` infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the total delay time calculated in the Sleep node?",
        "answer": "The total delay time in the Sleep node is calculated by converting the 'minutes' to seconds and adding it to the 'seconds' input. The sum, which represents the total delay time in seconds, allows for a pause in operations."
