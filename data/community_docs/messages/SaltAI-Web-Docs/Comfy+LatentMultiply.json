        "question": "What is LatentMultiply?",
        "answer": "LatentMultiply is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to scale the latent representation of samples by a specified multiplier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LatentMultiply node allow you to adjust?",
        "answer": "The LatentMultiply node allows you to adjust the intensity or magnitude of features within the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The LatentMultiply node requires inputs such as 'samples', which are latent representations to be scaled, and 'multiplier', which specifies the scaling factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentMultiply node is a modified version of the input latent samples, scaled by the specified multiplier."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LatentMultiply node contribute to exploring variations within the latent space?",
        "answer": "The LatentMultiply node contributes to exploring variations within the latent space by adjusting the intensity of its features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does 'multiplier' correspond to?",
        "answer": "'multiplier' corresponds to the Python data type 'float'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LatentMultiply node?",
        "answer": "The category of the LatentMultiply node is 'latent/advanced'."
