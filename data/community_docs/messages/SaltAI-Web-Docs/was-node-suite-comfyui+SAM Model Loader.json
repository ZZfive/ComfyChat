        "question": "What does SAM stand for in the context of the SAM Model Loader?",
        "answer": "SAM stands for Segment Anything Model, which is a specific type of model designed for image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different sizes of SAM models that can be loaded using the SAM Model Loader?",
        "answer": "The SAM Model Loader supports loading different sizes of the SAM model, including ViT-H, ViT-L, and ViT-B, each tailored for distinct performance and accuracy levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SAM Model Loader initialize the SAM model for use?",
        "answer": "The SAM Model Loader initializes the SAM model for use by downloading the model if it's not yet locally present and then setting it up based on the specified model size."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the SAM Model Loader fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SAM Model Loader node is categorized under 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the SAM Model Loader represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the SAM Model Loader is the loaded SAM model, represented with the dtype SAM_MODEL, ready for use in image segmentation tasks and initialized based on the specified model size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is associated with the output of the SAM Model Loader?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype associated with the output of the SAM Model Loader is 'torch.nn.Module', which represents the loaded SAM model as a neural network module in PyTorch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model_size' input parameter do in the SAM Model Loader?",
        "answer": "The 'model_size' input parameter in the SAM Model Loader specifies the size of the SAM model to be loaded, which can be one of 'ViT-H', 'ViT-L', or 'ViT-B', each corresponding to a different configuration of the model."
