        "question": "What is the Combine Masks node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Combine Masks node in ComfyUI is designed to perform various operations on two input masks, such as union, intersection, difference, and others, to produce a single output mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Combine Masks node?",
        "answer": "The Combine Masks node requires input types including 'image1', 'image2', 'op', 'clamp_result', and 'round_result'. 'image1' and 'image2' are the two masks to be combined, 'op' specifies the operation to be performed, while 'clamp_result' and 'round_result' control the result's value range and precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Combine Masks node handle the 'union (max)' operation?",
        "answer": "For the 'union (max)' operation, the Combine Masks node selects the maximum value at each pixel between 'image1' and 'image2'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operations can be specified using the 'op' input in Combine Masks?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in Combine Masks can specify operations such as 'union (max)', 'intersection (min)', 'difference', 'multiply', 'multiply_alpha', 'add', 'greater_or_equal', and 'greater'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'clamp_result' input do in the Combine Masks node?",
        "answer": "The 'clamp_result' input in Combine Masks determines whether the resulting mask values should be clamped between 0 and 1, ensuring valid mask values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'round_result' input play in the Combine Masks node?",
        "answer": "The 'round_result' input in Combine Masks indicates whether the values in the resulting mask should be rounded to the nearest integer, potentially simplifying the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the Combine Masks node provide?",
        "answer": "The Combine Masks node provides the output type 'image', which represents the resulting mask after applying the specified operation on the input masks."
