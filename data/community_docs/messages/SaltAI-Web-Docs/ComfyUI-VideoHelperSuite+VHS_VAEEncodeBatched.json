        "question": "What is the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node in ComfyUI is designed for batch processing of images through a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to produce latent representations, efficiently handling large sets of images by dividing them into smaller batches and encoding each batch separately."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node are 'pixels' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), 'vae' (Comfy dtype: VAE, Python dtype: VAE), and 'per_batch' (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'per_batch' parameter control in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The 'per_batch' parameter in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node controls the number of images processed in each batch, allowing for flexible management of memory usage and computational load during the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node is a latent representation of the input images, encoded by the VAE (Comfy dtype: LATENT, Python dtype: Dict[str, torch.Tensor])."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node belongs to the 'Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/batched nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'pixels' input represent in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' input in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node represents the images to be encoded into latent space, which is crucial for the operation of the node (Comfy dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: torch.Tensor)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the encoding mechanism and the structure of the generated latent space in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node?",
        "answer": "The encoding mechanism and the structure of the generated latent space in the VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node are determined by the 'vae' parameter, which specifies the Variational Autoencoder model used for encoding the images."
