        "question": "What is the purpose of the FindComplementaryColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindComplementaryColor node in ComfyUI is designed to find a color complementary to the dominant color in an image, using a color dictionary and a specified power factor, and can optionally apply a mask to focus the search on a specific area of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'power' input in the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'power' input in the FindComplementaryColor node influences the selection of the complementary color, adjusting the algorithm's sensitivity or bias towards certain colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the FindComplementaryColor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the FindComplementaryColor node are an image (`image`), a dictionary mapping color names to their RGB values (`color_dict`), and a factor that influences color selection (`power`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'mask' input used for in the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input in the FindComplementaryColor node is an optional parameter used to limit the search for the complementary color to a specific area of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the FindComplementaryColor node output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindComplementaryColor node outputs the RGB values of the complementary color found (`color`) and the name of the color as defined in the input color dictionary (`string`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data types are used for the inputs and outputs of the FindComplementaryColor node?",
        "answer": "In Python, the image input uses type `torch.Tensor`, the color dictionary input uses `Dict[str, Tuple[int, int, int]]`, the power input uses `float`, the output color uses `List[int]`, and the output string uses `str`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the FindComplementaryColor node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FindComplementaryColor node is classified under the category 'Bmad/CV/Color A.' within ComfyUI."
