        "question": "What is the JWSaveImageSequence node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWSaveImageSequence node is designed for batch saving of image sequences to a specified path, allowing customization of file naming, indexing, and the option to overwrite existing files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of input does the JWSaveImageSequence node require?",
        "answer": "The JWSaveImageSequence node requires four types of input: `images` (a tensor of images), `path_pattern` (a string pattern for naming and path), `start_index` (the starting index for naming files), and `overwrite` (a string indicating whether to overwrite existing files)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the `images` and `path_pattern` inputs in the JWSaveImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the `images` input is `torch.Tensor`, and for the `path_pattern` input, it is `str`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the JWSaveImageSequence node overwrite existing files, and how is this controlled?",
        "answer": "The JWSaveImageSequence node can overwrite existing files when the `overwrite` input is set to 'true'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `start_index` input in the JWSaveImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The `start_index` input in the JWSaveImageSequence node is used for naming the saved image files, starting the file numbering from the specified index."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used in ComfyUI to save a batch of image sequence to a specific path?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the node used to save a batch of image sequence to a specific path is the JWSaveImageSequence node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the JWSaveImageSequence node have output types?",
        "answer": "No, the JWSaveImageSequence node does not have any output types."
