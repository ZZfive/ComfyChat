        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_SplitMasks node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitMasks node is designed for dividing a batch of masks into two groups based on a specified index. This functionality is essential for managing and manipulating mask data in video processing tasks, allowing for flexible dataset segmentation and targeted processing of mask subsets."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the VHS_SplitMasks node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the VHS_SplitMasks node are 'mask' with dtype 'MASK' and 'split_index' with dtype 'INT'. The 'mask' parameter represents the batch of masks to be split, while the 'split_index' specifies the index at which the batch of masks is divided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific output does the VHS_SplitMasks node provide?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitMasks node provides MASK_A and MASK_B which represent the first and second group of masks obtained after splitting the original batch at the specified split_index. It also outputs A_count and B_count, which are the counts of masks in the first and second group respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the split_index parameter influence the output of the VHS_SplitMasks node?",
        "answer": "The split_index parameter in the VHS_SplitMasks node plays a pivotal role in determining the boundary between the two output groups. It influences the distribution of masks in the segmentation process, specifically deciding how many masks belong to MASK_A and MASK_B based on the masked data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used to divide batches of masks for video processing tasks?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitMasks node in ComfyUI is specifically designed for dividing batches of masks into two groups based on a specified index, which is crucial for the management and manipulation of mask data in video processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the VHS_SplitMasks node return when processing a batch of masks?",
        "answer": "When processing a batch of masks, the VHS_SplitMasks node returns the split groups as MASK_A and MASK_B as well as their respective counts A_count and B_count, which are the numbers of masks in each group after the split process in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an application of using the split_index in the VHS_SplitMasks node?",
        "answer": "Using the split_index in the VHS_SplitMasks node allows for targeted dataset segmentation, where you can dynamically control how the masks are divided into two groups for subsequent processing in ComfyUI's video editing and effects application workload."
