        "question": "What is the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleReverb node in ComfyUI is used to apply a reverb effect to an audio input, simulating the sound reflection characteristics of a physical space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleReverb node belongs to the 'SALT/Audio/Effect' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'audio' input in SaltAudioSimpleReverb node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' input in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node represents the audio input to which the reverb effect will be applied, serving as the raw material for the reverb simulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'reverb_level' input affect the output of SaltAudioSimpleReverb?",
        "answer": "The 'reverb_level' input determines the intensity of the reverb effect applied to the audio in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node, influencing the perceived size and reflectiveness of the virtual space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'decay' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node?",
        "answer": "The 'decay' parameter in the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node controls the rate at which the reverb effect fades away, simulating the absorption characteristics of the simulated space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SaltAudioSimpleReverb node produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioSimpleReverb node produces an audio output with the reverb effect applied, simulating the acoustic characteristics of a reverberant space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is SaltAudioSimpleReverb designed to work with?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioSimpleReverb is designed to work with the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
