        "question": "What is the SquareWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SquareWave is a node in ComfyUI designed to generate a square wave pattern with specified parameters such as phase, amplitude, and translations, which can be used in signal processing and waveform generation applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters are required to define a SquareWave in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SquareWave node in ComfyUI requires four parameters: phase, amplitude, x_translation, and y_translation, along with the current_frame to specify the point in time for wave value calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'x_translation' parameter do in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_translation' parameter in the SquareWave node shifts the wave along the X-axis, which can be used to adjust the starting point of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The SquareWave node outputs a float representing the primary wave value at the current frame, and an integer representation of the same value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'current_frame' parameter affect the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter specifies the current frame or point in time for which the wave value is being calculated in the SquareWave node, enabling dynamic wave generation over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'y_translation' parameter in the SquareWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'y_translation' parameter in the SquareWave node shifts the wave along the Y-axis, adjusting the baseline level of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name and category of the SquareWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SquareWave node is `SquareWave` and it falls under the category `FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/WaveNodes` in ComfyUI."
