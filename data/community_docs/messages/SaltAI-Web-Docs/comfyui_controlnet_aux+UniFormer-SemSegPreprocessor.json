        "question": "What is the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for semantic segmentation tasks, specifically within the ControlNet Preprocessors/Semantic Segmentation category. It processes images to segment them into different semantic regions based on learned representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What model does UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor utilize for semantic segmentation?",
        "answer": "UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor utilizes the UniformerSegmentor model for semantic segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first input required by the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The first input required by the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node is the `image`, which is the input image to be semantically segmented."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input for UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor and what does it specify?",
        "answer": "The optional input for UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor is `resolution`, which specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node output and in what format?",
        "answer": "The UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node outputs a segmented image, with the dtype being `IMAGE` in ComfyUI and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure requirement does UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor have?",
        "answer": "UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor has an infrastructure requirement of `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in the source code?",
        "answer": "The class name of the UniFormer-SemSegPreprocessor node in the source code is `Uniformer_SemSegPreprocessor`."
