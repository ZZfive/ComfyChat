        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images by extracting line art with a realistic style. It transforms input images into line drawings for further processing or artistic applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input parameters for the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter is the `image`, which is the input image for line art extraction. The optional parameters are `coarse`, which determines the level of detail in the line art, and `resolution`, which specifies the resolution for the extraction process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node handle the input image?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node takes the input image and processes it to extract line art. The resulting line art reflects a realistic style and is output as a processed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter allows the user to control the level of detail in the line art extraction process?",
        "answer": "The `coarse` parameter allows the user to control the level of detail in the line art extraction process. When enabled, the extraction is performed in a coarse manner, potentially altering the detail level in the resulting line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node is an `IMAGE`, represented as a `torch.Tensor`, which is the processed image that has undergone line art extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `resolution` parameter in the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node specify?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` parameter in the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node specifies the resolution at which the line art extraction should be performed. This affects the detail and quality of the output line art."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is `Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor`."
