        "question": "What is the Inpaint node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node in ComfyUI is designed to reconstruct missing or damaged parts of images by utilizing a specified inpainting technique, enhancing the overall image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does the Inpaint node require for inpainting an image?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node requires the 'img' parameter (the image to be inpainted), the 'mask' parameter (specifying the areas within the image that require inpainting), the 'radius' parameter (determining the neighborhood size for inpainting), and the 'flag' parameter (selecting the inpainting algorithm to be used)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input types does the Inpaint node accept for the 'img' parameter?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node accepts 'img' with Comfy dtype as 'IMAGE' and Python dtype as 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'radius' parameter of the Inpaint node influence the inpainting process?",
        "answer": "The 'radius' parameter determines the neighborhood size around each point for inpainting, thereby affecting the smoothness and extent of the inpainting effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible options for the 'flag' input in the Inpaint node?",
        "answer": "The 'flag' parameter in the Inpaint node can be set to 'TELEA' or 'NS', selecting between the 'INPAINT_TELEA' and 'INPAINT_NS' inpainting algorithms provided by OpenCV."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inpaint node output after processing the image?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node outputs the inpainted image, where the specified areas have been reconstructed using the chosen inpainting technique, with Comfy dtype as 'IMAGE' and Python dtype as 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "At which stage of the GPU processing pipeline is the Inpaint node primarily used?",
        "answer": "The Inpaint node is primarily used at the post-processing stage of the GPU pipeline, specifically for image reconstruction and enhancement tasks."
