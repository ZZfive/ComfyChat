        "question": "What is the purpose of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node is to apply the GrabCut algorithm with framing options to segment the foreground from the background in an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node include the 'image', 'thresh_maybe', 'thresh_sure', 'iterations', 'margin', 'frame_option', 'binary_threshold', 'maybe_black_is_sure_background', and 'output_format'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'iterations' input parameter play in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'iterations' input parameter in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node specifies the number of iterations the GrabCut algorithm will run, affecting the accuracy and detail of the segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'image' output processed by the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output of the node is processed by the GrabCut algorithm, resulting in an image with the foreground isolated from the background as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'maybe_black_is_sure_background' flag in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'maybe_black_is_sure_background' flag in the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node indicates whether areas identified as probable background in 'thresh_maybe' should be considered definite background, affecting the final segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs in ComfyUI's Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 are used to refine the segmentation process?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI's Framed Mask Grab Cut 2, the 'thresh_maybe' and 'thresh_sure' inputs are used to refine the segmentation process by indicating areas likely or sure to be the foreground."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node exclude when the 'IGNORE_HORIZONTAL' frame option is selected?",
        "answer": "When the 'IGNORE_HORIZONTAL' frame option is selected, the Framed Mask Grab Cut 2 node excludes horizontal margins from the frame, which can be used to ignore certain edges of the image."
