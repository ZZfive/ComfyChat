        "question": "What is the purpose of the Big Int Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Big Int Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively output an integer value based on a specified selection criterion, facilitating dynamic decision-making within data flows by allowing the selection of an integer from a predefined set based on input conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter specifies the index of the integer to be selected by the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The `select` parameter specifies the index of the integer to be selected by the Big Int Switch node. It plays a crucial role in determining which integer value is output based on the selection logic implemented."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Big Int Switch node handle cases where the desired integer is missing?",
        "answer": "The Big Int Switch node handles cases where the desired integer is missing by using the `on_missing` parameter, which defines the behavior of the node in such scenarios, ensuring that it can gracefully handle these cases by specifying an alternative selection strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of inputs does the Big Int Switch node accept?",
        "answer": "The Big Int Switch node accepts two required inputs and one optional set of inputs. The required inputs are `select`, which is an integer specifying the index of the integer to be selected, and `on_missing`, which is a string defining the behavior when a selected integer is missing. The node also accepts optional inputs `input_i`, which represent potential integer values that can be selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `on_missing` parameter in the Big Int Switch node allow for?",
        "answer": "The `on_missing` parameter in the Big Int Switch node allows for specifying the behavior of the node when the selected integer is missing. This ensures that the node can handle cases where the desired integer is not available, by specifying an alternative selection strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Big Int Switch node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Big Int Switch node is the `selected` integer, which is the integer value that has been selected based on the input criteria. This output reflects the decision made by the node in selecting one integer from the available options."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what language is the Big Int Switch node implemented?",
        "answer": "The Big Int Switch node is implemented in Python. The class `DreamBigIntSwitch` is responsible for handling the logic of the node, including input validation and integer selection."
