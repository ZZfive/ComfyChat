    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'text' input in the Text Random Line node?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input in the Text Random Line node is the input text from which a line will be randomly selected. This parameter is crucial for determining the pool of possible lines to choose from."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'seed' input in the Text Random Line node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input in the Text Random Line node is a seed value to ensure the reproducibility of the random selection. This parameter influences the randomness, allowing for consistent results across different executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Text Random Line node output?",
        "answer": "The Text Random Line node outputs a single, randomly chosen line from the input text. The output is of type 'STRING'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Text Random Line node work?",
        "answer": "The Text Random Line node works by splitting the input text into lines and then using the seed value to randomly select one of those lines. The result is a single line of text that is returned as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes can be used with the Text Random Line node?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that can be used with the Text Random Line node include the CR Text Concatenate and Text Concatenate nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name for the Text Random Line node?",
        "answer": "The Python class name for the Text Random Line node is 'WAS_Text_Random_Line'."
