        "question": "What is Seed Everywhere?",
        "answer": "Seed Everywhere is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to propagate a given seed value throughout the system, ensuring consistent and reproducible results across different components or executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of Seed Everywhere?",
        "answer": "The purpose of Seed Everywhere is to manage seed values effectively, maintaining deterministic behavior in random number generation and other stochastic processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Seed Everywhere ensure reproducibility?",
        "answer": "Seed Everywhere ensures reproducibility by propagating the same seed value across the system, which guarantees that the same input will always produce the same output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for Seed Everywhere?",
        "answer": "Seed Everywhere requires an input type 'seed', which is an integer parameter used to initialize random number generators or other stochastic processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of Seed Everywhere?",
        "answer": "The output type of Seed Everywhere is an integer ('INT'), returning the same seed value that was input, allowing it to be used or propagated further."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type does Seed Everywhere operate on?",
        "answer": "Seed Everywhere operates on 'CPU' infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes related to Seed Everywhere?",
        "answer": "Common nodes related to Seed Everywhere include KSampler, CR Module Pipe Loader, Text Random Line, Anything Everywhere, CR Random Hex Color, CR Random Multiline Values, SeargeSDXLSamplerV3, and KSampler Adv. (Efficient)."
