        "question": "What is the purpose of the Prune By Mask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Prune By Mask node in ComfyUI is designed to filter out images from a batch based on the associated mask's average pixel value, ensuring only images with sufficiently defined masks are processed further."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Prune By Mask node decide which images to filter out?",
        "answer": "The Prune By Mask node filters out images that do not have an associated mask with an average pixel value of at least 0.5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Prune By Mask node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Prune By Mask node are 'image', representing the batch of images to be filtered, and 'mask', used to determine which images meet the average pixel value criterion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'image' and 'mask' inputs for the Prune By Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' and 'mask' inputs for the Prune By Mask node have a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' output of the Prune By Mask node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'image' output of the Prune By Mask node represents the filtered batch of images that have passed the average pixel value criterion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the Prune By Mask belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Prune By Mask node belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is the Prune By Mask node designed for?",
        "answer": "The Prune By Mask node is designed for 'GPU' infrastructure."
