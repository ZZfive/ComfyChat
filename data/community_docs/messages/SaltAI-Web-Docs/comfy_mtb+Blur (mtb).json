        "question": "What does the Blur (mtb) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Blur (mtb) node in ComfyUI applies a Gaussian blur to an image, reducing image noise and detail, similar to shooting in a lower resolution or with a softer focus lens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of blurring does the Blur (mtb) node support?",
        "answer": "The Blur (mtb) node supports both uniform blurring and variable blurring across different parts of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the primary data in the Blur (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the primary data in the Blur (mtb) node is `image` with Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the horizontal and vertical amounts of blur controlled in the Blur (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The horizontal and vertical amounts of blur are controlled by the `sigmaX` and `sigmaY` parameters, respectively, which specify the standard deviation in the x-direction and y-direction for the Gaussian kernel."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types in the Blur (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types in the Blur (mtb) node are `sigmasX` and `sigmasY`, lists of standard deviations that allow for variable blur across the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Blur (mtb) node produce?",
        "answer": "The Blur (mtb) node produces an output image after applying the Gaussian blur, having reduced noise and detail, with a Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure requirement is necessary for the Blur (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure requirement for the Blur (mtb) node is `GPU`, indicating it is best run on a graphics processing unit."
