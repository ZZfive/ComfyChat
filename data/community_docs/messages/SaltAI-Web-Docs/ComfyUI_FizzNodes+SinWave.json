        "question": "What is the SinWave node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SinWave node in ComfyUI is a custom node belonging to the FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/WaveNodes category, designed to generate a sinusoidal wave. It allows the adjustment of various parameters to dynamically control the wave's behavior for visual or audio applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters can be used to control the sinusoidal wave generated by the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The sinusoidal wave generated by the SinWave node can be controlled using parameters such as 'phase', 'amplitude', 'x_translation', and 'y_translation'. These parameters allow for adjustments in the wave's position, height, and overall position on the x and y axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'phase' parameter play in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the SinWave node determines the phase shift of the sine wave, affecting the wave's position along the x-axis. It is used to adjust the start of the wave within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SinWave node determine the height and intensity of the sine wave?",
        "answer": "The height and intensity of the sine wave generated by the SinWave node are determined by the 'amplitude' parameter. This parameter adjusts the peaks of the wave, controlling its intensity or level of loudness in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'current_frame' parameter in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the SinWave node specifies the current frame or point in time for which the wave's value is being calculated. This parameter is critical for animating the wave over time, making it suitable for dynamic visual and audio effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types associated with the inputs in the SinWave node?",
        "answer": "The SinWave node's input parameters have the following data types: 'phase', 'amplitude', and 'x_translation' are of type FLOAT, while 'y_translation' and 'current_frame' are of type FLOAT and INT, respectively. These types are consistent with the ComfyUI dtype system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the SinWave node provide?",
        "answer": "The SinWave node provides two outputs: the first is a FLOAT representing the calculated sine wave value, which is the wave's current amplitude at the specified frame. The second output is of type INT, providing the integer representation of the sine wave value, suitable for applications requiring discrete values."
