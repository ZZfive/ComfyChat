        "question": "What is the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node used for?",
        "answer": "The CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node is used for encoding text inputs using an advanced CLIP model, enhanced by BlenderNeko's modifications, and optionally incorporating Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP) for dynamic text manipulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the 'mode' input of the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node be used?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input determines the mode of text manipulation, such as using Noodle Soup Prompts for dynamic text changes, enhancing the input text representation for downstream tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'noodle_key' input in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The 'noodle_key' input in the node is used as a key for identifying placeholders in the text that can be dynamically replaced using Noodle Soup Prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'seed' input in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node is used for random elements in text manipulation, ensuring reproducibility of the text encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'token_normalization' input in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node?",
        "answer": "The 'token_normalization' input determines how tokens are normalized during the encoding process, which affects the representation's sensitivity to token frequency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'weight_interpretation' input in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node control?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_interpretation' input controls how the weights are interpreted in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node's encoding process, influencing the emphasis on certain aspects of the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output from the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node represents the encoded text representation suitable for downstream tasks?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' output from the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node represents the encoded text representation suitable for downstream tasks such as image generation or text-based conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the 'raw_text', 'parsed_text', and 'ui' outputs in the CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP) node, and how can they be useful?",
        "answer": "The 'raw_text' output shows the original input text before processing, the 'parsed_text' output displays the text after being processed and potentially modified, and the 'ui' output provides a user interface to display the processed text, which can be useful for insight into how the text was interpreted and manipulated."
