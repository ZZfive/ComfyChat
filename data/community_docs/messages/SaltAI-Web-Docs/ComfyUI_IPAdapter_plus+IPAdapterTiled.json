        "question": "What is the IPAdapterTiled node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterTiled node in ComfyUI is designed to apply image processing adaptations in a tiled manner, enabling the handling of larger images by processing them in segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for implementing the tiled image processing in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class responsible for implementing the tiled image processing in ComfyUI is `IPAdapterTiled`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'sharpening' in the IPAdapterTiled node?",
        "answer": "The 'sharpening' parameter in the IPAdapterTiled node adjusts the sharpness of the adapted image, enhancing detail clarity as part of the image processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does IPAdapterTiled handle larger images during the adaptation process?",
        "answer": "IPAdapterTiled handles larger images by processing them in segments, or tiles, allowing for detailed and scalable image modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the IPAdapterTiled node?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterTiled node provides three output types: `MODEL`, `tiles`, and `masks`. The `MODEL` output is the modified model after applying the tiled image processing adaptations. The `tiles` output are the processed image segments that have been adapted. The `masks` output are the attention masks corresponding to each tile, indicating areas of focus or preservation during the adaptation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default tile size used by the IPAdapterTiled node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The default tile size used by the IPAdapterTiled node in ComfyUI is 256 pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IPAdapterTiled node handle contrastive adaptations?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterTiled node can handle contrastive adaptations by using an optional negative image input (`image_negative`), which can be used to enhance specific features by comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in IPAdapterTiled determines the scaling approach for embeddings?",
        "answer": "The parameter that determines the scaling approach for embeddings in the IPAdapterTiled node is `embeds_scaling`."
