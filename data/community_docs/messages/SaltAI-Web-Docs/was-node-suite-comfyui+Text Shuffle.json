        "question": "What is the purpose of the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The Text Shuffle node is designed to randomly shuffle the segments of a given text string based on a specified separator, allowing for the creation of varied and unpredictable text sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Text Shuffle node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Shuffle node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Text/Operations' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Text Shuffle node is `WAS_Text_Shuffle`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of text segments can be shuffled with the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The Text Shuffle node can shuffle segments of any text string that is provided as input, rearranging the segments to create a new, randomized sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `separator` parameter used in the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The `separator` parameter in the Text Shuffle node defines the character or string that delimits the segments of the input text to be shuffled, providing flexible segmentation based on the specific needs of the text being processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `seed` parameter in the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` parameter in the Text Shuffle node sets the seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the shuffle operation, which is useful for maintaining consistency across different runs or experiments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Text Shuffle node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Text Shuffle node is a new text string with its segments shuffled in a random order, based on the specified separator."
