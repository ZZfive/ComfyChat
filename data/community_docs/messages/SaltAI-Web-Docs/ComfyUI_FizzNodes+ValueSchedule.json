        "question": "What is the ValueSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ValueSchedule is a node in ComfyUI that animates values over a sequence of frames based on keyframes defined in a text input and computes interpolated values to provide dynamic, frame-specific outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of inputs does ValueSchedule require for animation?",
        "answer": "ValueSchedule requires a multiline string for keyframes (text), the maximum number of frames (max_frames), the current frame number (current_frame), and a boolean flag for printing output (print_output)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The ValueSchedule node outputs a floating-point number and an integer representing the interpolated value for the current frame in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ValueSchedule node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ValueSchedule node belongs to the FizzNodes üìÖüÖïüÖù/ScheduleNodes category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text' input in ValueSchedule represent?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input in ValueSchedule is a multiline string that contains the keyframes for animation, serving as the blueprint for generating interpolated values across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'max_frames' input determine for the ValueSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'max_frames' input determines the maximum number of frames for the animation in ValueSchedule, setting an upper limit for frame modulation and interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'print_output' input affect the behavior of ValueSchedule?",
        "answer": "The 'print_output' input, when set to true, enables ValueSchedule to print the current frame and its corresponding value for debugging and monitoring purposes."
