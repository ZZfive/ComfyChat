        "question": "What is the CR Gradient Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Gradient Integer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a gradient of integer values based on a specified start and end value, frame duration, and the current frame, providing a smooth transition between the start and end values over the specified duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Gradient Integer node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Gradient Integer node include 'start_value', 'end_value', 'start_frame', 'frame_duration', 'current_frame', and 'gradient_profile'. These inputs define the range, timing, and method of interpolation for the gradient."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Gradient Integer node calculate the interpolated integer value?",
        "answer": "The CR Gradient Integer node calculates the interpolated integer value based on the difference between the 'start_value' and 'end_value', scaled by the 'frame_duration' and the current position within this duration as determined by 'current_frame'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'gradient_profile' input of the CR Gradient Integer node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_profile' input represents a profile that defines the characteristics of the gradient, such as its type or method of interpolation, with 'Lerp' being the current option available."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Gradient Integer node?",
        "answer": "The CR Gradient Integer node has two output types: 'INT', which is the interpolated integer value at the current frame, and 'show_help', which is a URL to a help page providing more information about the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_duration' input influence the operation of the CR Gradient Integer node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_duration' input specifies the total duration over which the gradient transitions from the 'start_value' to the 'end_value'. This input is crucial for determining the timing and smoothness of the interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'show_help' output of the CR Gradient Integer node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output of the CR Gradient Integer node provides a URL to a help page where users can find more detailed information about how the CR_GradientInteger node works and how to use it effectively."
