        "question": "What is the SaltCyclicalSchedule node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The SaltCyclicalSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a cyclical pattern within a given schedule list, allowing for repetition of a specified segment of the schedule, optionally with a ping-pong effect for enhanced dynamic range and variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the starting point of the segment to be repeated in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_index' input specifies the starting index of the segment within the schedule list to be repeated in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the 'schedule_list' input in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the 'schedule_list' input in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node is List[Any]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many times will the specified segment be repeated in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node, based on input?",
        "answer": "The specified segment will be repeated as many times as specified by the 'repetitions' input in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does enabling the 'ping_pong' input achieve in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'ping_pong' input in the SaltCyclicalSchedule node adds a mirrored repetition of the segment to the cycle, creating a back-and-forth pattern that enhances the schedule's complexity."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what form is the result of the SaltCyclicalSchedule node operation output?",
        "answer": "The result of the SaltCyclicalSchedule node operation is output as a list after applying the cyclical pattern generation, including any repeated segments and, if enabled, mirrored repetitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing is the SaltCyclicalSchedule node associated with in terms of hardware usage?",
        "answer": "The SaltCyclicalSchedule node is associated with CPU processing, according to its infrastructure type."
