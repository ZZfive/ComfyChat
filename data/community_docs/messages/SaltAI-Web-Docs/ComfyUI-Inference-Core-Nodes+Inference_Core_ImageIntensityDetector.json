        "question": "What is the ImageIntensityDetector node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI is designed for preprocessing images by adjusting their intensity levels using gamma correction to enhance image quality or achieve specific visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImageIntensityDetector node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Recolor' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ImageIntensityDetector node is the input image (dtype: IMAGE, Python dtype: numpy.ndarray) to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the optional 'gamma_correction' input do in the ImageIntensityDetector node?",
        "answer": "The 'gamma_correction' input in the ImageIntensityDetector node specifies the gamma correction factor that adjusts the intensity levels of the image, influencing the brightness and contrast of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the resolution of the output image be adjusted in the ImageIntensityDetector node, and how?",
        "answer": "Yes, the resolution for the output image can be defined as an optional parameter in the ImageIntensityDetector node, determining the dimensions to which the image will be adjusted during processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageIntensityDetector node output?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node outputs an image that has undergone intensity adjustment based on the specified gamma correction, suitable for further analysis or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of computation does the ImageIntensityDetector node utilize?",
        "answer": "The ImageIntensityDetector node utilizes CPU computation for its operations."
