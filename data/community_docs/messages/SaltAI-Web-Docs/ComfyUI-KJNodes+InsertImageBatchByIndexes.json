        "question": "What is the purpose of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImageBatchByIndexes node in ComfyUI is designed for integrating specific images into a given batch of images at designated indexes, maintaining the original sequence order of the batch. This is particularly useful for tasks that require precise manipulation of image sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node are images (the original batch of images), images_to_insert (the images to be inserted into the original batch), and insert_indexes (the indexes within the original batch where the new images should be inserted)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' input of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node represents the original batch of images where new images are to be inserted. It is the base for the insertion operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node is images_after_insert, which represents the updated batch of images after insertion, preserving the original sequence order with the new images integrated at specified positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What action does the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node take if the number of images to insert does not match the number of insert indexes?",
        "answer": "If the number of images_to_insert does not match the number of insert_indexes, the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node will print a warning and skip the operation, indicating that the number of images_to_insert ({images_to_insert_num}) is not equal to the number of insert_indexes ({insert_indexes_num})."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'insert' method in the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node?",
        "answer": "The 'insert' method in the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node is responsible for integrating images_to_insert into the images base, according to the specified insert_indexes, and returning the updated batch images_after_insert."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the InsertImageBatchByIndexes node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InsertImageBatchByIndexes node belongs to the category 'KJNodes/image' in ComfyUI."
