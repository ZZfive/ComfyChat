        "question": "What type of calculations can the DF_Sinus node perform in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sinus node in ComfyUI can perform sine and arcsine calculations based on the input angle given in radians or degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'type_' input in the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "The 'type_' input in the DF_Sinus node specifies the unit of the input angle, either 'RAD' for radians or 'DEG' for degrees, which influences how the input value is interpreted before the calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name and category of the Sinus node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Sinus node in ComfyUI is `DF_Sinus`, and it belongs to the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'arcSin' input used for in the DF_Sinus node?",
        "answer": "The 'arcSin' input in the DF_Sinus node is a boolean flag used to switch the operation from sine to arcsine when set to true, enabling inverse trigonometric calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'value' input in DF_Sinus represent?",
        "answer": "The 'value' input in DF_Sinus represents the angle for which the sine value is calculated or the input value for computing the arcsine, based on the 'arcSin' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the DF_Sinus node's output represent?",
        "answer": "The DF_Sinus node's output represents the result of the sine or arcsine calculation, based on the input parameters, and it is a floating-point number in the ComfyUI environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'DEG' input handled in the DF_Sinus node source code?",
        "answer": "In the DF_Sinus node source code, if the 'type_' input is 'DEG', the input angle value is converted to radians using the `math.radians()` function before the trigonometric calculation is performed."
