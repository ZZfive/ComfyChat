        "question": "What is the 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node is designed to process and enhance text prompts through sophisticated encoding techniques, leveraging external models or custom algorithms, to refine the quality and specificity of generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter determines the model used for encoding in the 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' parameter specifies the model to be used for encoding, which is a critical component determining the effectiveness of the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the CLIP model utilized in 'WildcardEncode __Inspire'?",
        "answer": "The 'clip' parameter refers to the CLIP model used alongside the primary model to enhance the encoding process, playing a vital role in interpreting and processing the text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What controls how weights are interpreted during encoding in 'WildcardEncode __Inspire'?",
        "answer": "The 'weight_interpretation' parameter determines how weights are interpreted during the encoding process, impacting the final encoded output's quality and relevance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'wildcard_text' input?",
        "answer": "The 'wildcard_text' input is the text that will be encoded, being central to the node's operation and directly influencing the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' generate advanced text?",
        "answer": "The 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node generates advanced text by populating the 'wildcard_text' through the encoding process and reflecting the enhanced version of the input text in the 'populated_text' output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter do in the 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter controls whether the text is populated dynamically or fixed, affecting how the 'wildcard_text' is processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which feature allows adding LoRA to the text in 'WildcardEncode __Inspire'?",
        "answer": "The 'Select to add LoRA' feature allows the selection of a LoRA to add to the text, enhancing the encoding with specific characteristics or effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Select to add Wildcard' feature?",
        "answer": "The 'Select to add Wildcard' feature enables the addition of a predefined wildcard to the text, further customizing the encoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'seed' parameter used for in 'WildcardEncode __Inspire'?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter is used to set the seed value for random processes within the encoding, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' compatible with?",
        "answer": "The 'WildcardEncode __Inspire' node is compatible with an infra type of 'CPU'."
