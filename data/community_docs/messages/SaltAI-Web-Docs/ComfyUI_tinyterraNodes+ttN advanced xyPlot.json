        "question": "What is the ttN advanced xyPlot node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The ttN advanced xyPlot node in ComfyUI is designed for advanced plotting capabilities, enabling the generation and manipulation of XY plots with enhanced features such as grid spacing, latent index consideration, and individual output control."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which feature of ttN advanced xyPlot allows for the detailed examination of data points?",
        "answer": "The ttN advanced xyPlot node provides an 'output_individuals' feature that controls whether individual data points are outputted separately, enabling detailed examination and analysis of each point within the plot."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'latent_index' input in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_index' input in the ttN advanced xyPlot node identifies a specific latent dimension or index to be visualized, allowing for targeted exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data spaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the spacing between points on the grid in ttN advanced xyPlot?",
        "answer": "You can specify the spacing between points on the grid in the ttN advanced xyPlot node using the 'grid_spacing' input, which affects the density and separation of plotted points, and influences the plot's granularity and overall appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node input in ttN advanced xyPlot determines if the x and y axes should be swapped?",
        "answer": "The 'flip_xy' input in the ttN advanced xyPlot node determines whether the x and y axes should be swapped, allowing for alternative perspectives and orientations of the plotted data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type is used for the 'grid_spacing' input in the ttN advanced xyPlot node?",
        "answer": "The 'grid_spacing' input in the ttN advanced xyPlot node uses the 'INT' data type, which is an integer type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'adv_xyPlot' output from the ttN advanced xyPlot node contain?",
        "answer": "The 'adv_xyPlot' output from the ttN advanced xyPlot node is a dictionary containing the plot data, including x and y coordinates, grid spacing, latent index, and output control information, encapsulating the plot's comprehensive configuration."
