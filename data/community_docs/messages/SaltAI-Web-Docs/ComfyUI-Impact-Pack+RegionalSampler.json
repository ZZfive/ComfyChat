        "question": "What is the RegionalSampler node in ComfyUI designed for?",
        "answer": "The RegionalSampler node in ComfyUI is designed for advanced regional sampling within latent spaces, allowing for precise manipulation and enhancement of specific regions in generated images or data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls the number of steps in the RegionalSampler's sampling process?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' input controls the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, impacting the depth and detail of the sampling operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'denoise' input in the RegionalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' input controls the level of denoising applied to the sampled output, affecting the clarity and quality of the generated results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'additional_sampler' input in the RegionalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'additional_sampler' input selects an additional sampler to be used in conjunction with the base sampler, enabling a combination of sampling techniques for enhanced results."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'additional_sigma_ratio' input affect the sampling process in RegionalSampler?",
        "answer": "The 'additional_sigma_ratio' input sets the ratio of sigma values used in the additional sampler, affecting the intensity and impact of the supplementary sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the initial seed for random number generation in the RegionalSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input specifies the initial seed for random number generation, influencing the sampling process's reproducibility and variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'restore_latent' input in RegionalSampler indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'restore_latent' input is a boolean flag indicating whether the original latent state should be restored after sampling, affecting the preservation of the initial input characteristics."
