        "question": "What does the `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` node in ComfyUI applies a blurring effect specifically to areas within an image defined by a mask, enabling smooth transitions between blurred and unblurred regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` controls the intensity of the blurring effect?",
        "answer": "The parameter `blur` in `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` determines the intensity of the blurring effect, with higher values leading to more pronounced blurring."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `falloff` parameter in `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`?",
        "answer": "The `falloff` parameter in `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` adjusts the transition between blurred and unblurred areas, allowing for a smoother or more abrupt change based on the value set."
    },
    {
        "question": "In `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`, what dtype does the `image` parameter use?",
        "answer": "In `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`, the `image` parameter uses the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and the Python dtype `Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the mask used in `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`?",
        "answer": "In `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`, the `mask` parameter is used to specify the areas within the image to be blurred, controlling the spatial application of the blur effect according to specified regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` node return?",
        "answer": "The `INPAINT_MaskedBlur` node returns the modified image with the specified areas blurred according to the mask and blur settings, with the dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operation is performed on the `blur` parameter in the source code of `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`?",
        "answer": "In the source code of `INPAINT_MaskedBlur`, the `blur` parameter undergoes an operation to ensure it is an odd number, utilizing the function `make_odd(blur)`, to maintain image integrity during the blurring process."
