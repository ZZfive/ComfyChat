    {
        "question": "What does the LLMLlamaCPPModel node output when the model is loaded?",
        "answer": "The LLMLlamaCPPModel node outputs a dictionary containing the loaded LlamaCPP model, its name, the associated embedding model, and the embedding model's name, ready for further processing or use in NLP tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which embedding model is integrated with the LlamaCPP model by the LLMLlamaCPPModel node?",
        "answer": "The LLMLlamaCPPModel node integrates the HuggingFaceEmbedding model with the name 'BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5' for enhanced functionality."

    {
        "question": "What does the 'load_model' method of the LLMLlamaCPP class do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'load_model' method of the LLMLlamaCPP class loads the LlamaCPP model specified by 'model_name', locates the model, and prepares it for use along with the associated embedding model and returns it as a dictionary."
