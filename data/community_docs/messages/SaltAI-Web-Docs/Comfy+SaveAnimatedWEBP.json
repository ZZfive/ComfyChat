        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaveAnimatedWEBP node?",
        "answer": "The SaveAnimatedWEBP node is designed to save a sequence of images as an animated WEBP file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaveAnimatedWEBP node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaveAnimatedWEBP node include 'images' (a list of PIL images), 'filename_prefix' (a string specifying the base name for the output file), 'fps' (frames per second rate), 'lossless' (boolean for lossless compression), 'quality' (compression quality level), and 'method' (compression method)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaveAnimatedWEBP node handle images?",
        "answer": "The SaveAnimatedWEBP node aggregates individual frames into a cohesive animation, applies metadata, and optimizes the output based on quality and compression settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SaveAnimatedWEBP node?",
        "answer": "The SaveAnimatedWEBP node belongs to the 'image/animation' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fps' parameter control in the SaveAnimatedWEBP node?",
        "answer": "The 'fps' parameter in the SaveAnimatedWEBP node controls the frames per second rate for the animation, influencing the playback speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaveAnimatedWEBP node determine the filename of the output file?",
        "answer": "The SaveAnimatedWEBP node determines the filename of the output file by appending a counter and the '.webp' extension to the specified 'filename_prefix'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lossless' parameter signify in the SaveAnimatedWEBP node?",
        "answer": "The 'lossless' parameter in the SaveAnimatedWEBP node indicates whether to use lossless compression, affecting the file size and quality of the animated WEBP."
