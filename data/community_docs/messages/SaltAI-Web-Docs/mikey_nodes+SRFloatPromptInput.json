        "question": "What is the purpose of the SRFloatPromptInput node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SRFloatPromptInput node is designed to process floating-point inputs for specific prompts, integrating them into a larger data structure based on unique identifiers, primarily to update or modify prompt-related information with floating-point values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does SRFloatPromptInput belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SRFloatPromptInput belongs to the category `Mikey/Meta` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the input `input_float` play in the SRFloatPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The input `input_float` represents the floating-point value to be integrated into the prompt's data structure, playing a crucial role in the dynamic modification or generation of content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype of `input_float`?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of `input_float` is `FLOAT`, and the Python dtype is `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SRFloatPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SRFloatPromptInput node include `float` with an unknown Comfy dtype and Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `add` method in SRFloatPromptInput?",
        "answer": "The `add` method in SRFloatPromptInput updates the prompt data structure with the floating-point value from `input_float` by integrating it into the 'sr_val' key under the 'inputs' section associated with a specific unique identifier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for running the SRFloatPromptInput node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for running the SRFloatPromptInput node is `CPU`."
