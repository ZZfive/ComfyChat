        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Gaussian Region node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Gaussian Region node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a Gaussian blur to specified regions within given masks, creating softer, more natural-looking mask boundaries by utilizing a Gaussian filter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the smoothness of the blurred mask region in the Mask Gaussian Region node?",
        "answer": "The smoothness of the blurred mask region is determined by the radius input, which defines the extent of the Gaussian blur. A larger radius results in a smoother, more blurred mask region."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used with the Mask Gaussian Region node?",
        "answer": "The Mask Gaussian Region node is commonly used with VAEEncodeForInpaint, MaskToSEGS, and MaskToImage nodes in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Mask Gaussian Region node output?",
        "answer": "The Mask Gaussian Region node outputs `MASKS`, which are the masks after applying the Gaussian blur to the specified regions, resulting in smoother transitions and edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Mask Gaussian Region node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Gaussian Region node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what purpose would you use the radius input in the Mask Gaussian Region node?",
        "answer": "The radius input in the Mask Gaussian Region node is used to define the intensity of the Gaussian blur, a larger value leading to more blurred mask regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function called in the source code of the WAS Mask Gaussian Region class?",
        "answer": "The function called in the source code of the WAS Mask Gaussian Region class to apply the Gaussian blur is named `gaussian_region`."
