        "question": "What is SampleColorHSV used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SampleColorHSV is a custom node in ComfyUI that samples pixels from an RGB image and converts these samples into the HSV color space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the SampleColorHSV node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SampleColorHSV node falls under the category 'Bmad/CV/Color A.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the SampleColorHSV node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the SampleColorHSV node are 'rgb_image', 'sample_size', and 'sampling_seed'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'rgb_image' input provide for the SampleColorHSV node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'rgb_image' input provides the RGB image from which pixels will be sampled to generate a subset of color information in HSV format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sample_size' input in the SampleColorHSV node?",
        "answer": "The 'sample_size' input determines the number of pixels to be sampled from the RGB image, thus affecting the representativeness of the subset of the image's color distribution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sampling_seed' input do in the SampleColorHSV node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'sampling_seed' input in SampleColorHSV is a seed value for the random number generator used in sampling pixels, ensuring reproducibility of the sampled subset across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output from the SampleColorHSV node called?",
        "answer": "The output from the SampleColorHSV node is called 'hsv_samples', which is a collection of sampled pixels converted from RGB to HSV color space."
