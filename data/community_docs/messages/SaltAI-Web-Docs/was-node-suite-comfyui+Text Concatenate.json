        "question": "Which node should I use to merge several text strings into one, allowing for optimization of whitespace?",
        "answer": "You should use the Text Concatenate node in ComfyUI, which can merge multiple text inputs into a single string, removing leading and trailing whitespace if the `clean_whitespace` option is set to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Text Concatenate node, how is whitespace handled before concatenation?",
        "answer": "In the Text Concatenate node, the `clean_whitespace` parameter determines whether leading and trailing whitespace should be removed from each text input before concatenation, ensuring a clean output format when set to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `delimiter` parameter play in the Text Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The `delimiter` parameter in the Text Concatenate node specifies the character or string used to separate each text input in the concatenated result, defining the structure and readability of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Text Concatenate node process more than two text inputs?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Text Concatenate node can process multiple text inputs including `text_a`, `text_b`, `text_c`, and `text_d`, allowing for dynamic and flexible text merging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Text Concatenate node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Text Concatenate node is `string`, providing the final string resulting from the concatenation of all provided text inputs, formatted according to the specified delimiter and whitespace cleaning settings."
