        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWLoadImageSequence node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequence node in ComfyUI is designed for batch loading of image sequences with a specified stop index, enabling the efficient handling and processing of multiple images at once by allowing users to define a specific range within the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the initial image to be included in the processing using JWLoadImageSequence?",
        "answer": "The starting index for loading the image sequence, defined by the `start_index` input, determines the initial image to be included in the processing using JWLoadImageSequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does JWLoadImageSequence handle missing images within the specified range?",
        "answer": "JWLoadImageSequence handles missing images within the specified range by allowing users to determine whether to ignore them through the `ignore_missing_images` input, providing flexible handling of incomplete sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does JWLoadImageSequence generate?",
        "answer": "JWLoadImageSequence generates a batch of images loaded based on the specified criteria, output as a sequence of `IMAGE` data type, which is represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `path_pattern` input specify in the JWLoadImageSequence node?",
        "answer": "The `path_pattern` input in the JWLoadImageSequence node specifies the pattern or path used to locate and load the images in the sequence, playing a crucial role in identifying the files to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node would you use to load multiple images based on a specific start index and frame count in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, you would use the JWLoadImageSequence node to load multiple images based on a specific start index and frame count."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node allows for the efficient batch loading of images while ignoring missing files within a sequence in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequence node in ComfyUI allows for the efficient batch loading of images while also providing the option to ignore missing files within the sequence through its `ignore_missing_images` input."
