        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image to Latent Mask' node in ComfyUI is designed to convert an image into a latent mask representation, facilitating the manipulation and analysis of images in a latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the 'Image to Latent Mask' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image to Latent Mask' node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Masking' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node, and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output type of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node is 'MASK', which represents a collection of masks derived from the specified image channels, suitable for use in various image manipulation and analysis tasks within a latent space framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required 'images' input of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node, and what is its purpose?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node represents the input images to be converted into a latent mask, crucial for enabling further operations in the latent space, such as blending or compositing with other latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'channel' input parameter of the 'Image to Latent Mask' node influence the resulting latent mask?",
        "answer": "The 'channel' input parameter specifies the color channel ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'alpha') to be used in the mask creation process, significantly influencing the resulting latent mask by highlighting specific features or areas of interest."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is the 'Image to Latent Mask' node in terms of infrastructure type?",
        "answer": "In terms of infrastructure type, the 'Image to Latent Mask' node is classified as 'GPU', indicating that it is optimized for processing on a Graphics Processing Unit."
    },
