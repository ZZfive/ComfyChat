        "question": "What is the 'easy imageSplitList' node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The 'easy imageSplitList' node in ComfyUI is used to split a given image or a batch of images into a list of smaller images, enabling individual processing or analysis of each segment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of input does 'easy imageSplitList' accept?",
        "answer": "'easy imageSplitList' accepts 'images' as input, which can either be a single image or a batch of images in the form of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of 'easy imageSplitList'?",
        "answer": "'easy imageSplitList' outputs a list of smaller images, all of which are of type IMAGE and represented as List[torch.Tensor] in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines how 'easy imageSplitList' splits the input image(s)?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in 'easy imageSplitList' determines how the original image(s) will be divided into smaller segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is 'easy imageSplitList' an input or output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "'easy imageSplitList' is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is required for the 'easy imageSplitList' node?",
        "answer": "The 'easy imageSplitList' node requires an infra type of 'GPU' for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'easy imageSplitList' split images based on the length of the input image list?",
        "answer": "'easy imageSplitList' splits images into three separate lists if the length of the input image list is divisible by 3, or into two lists if the length is divisible by 2. The images are distributed evenly among these lists based on their order."
