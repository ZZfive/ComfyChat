        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentation node specializes in segmenting images into distinct regions, separating foreground from background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What techniques does the ImageSegmentation node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentation node utilizes advanced models and techniques such as alpha matting to refine the segmentation edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageSegmentation node include images to be segmented, the segmentation model to use, and parameters for alpha matting."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does alpha matting influence the ImageSegmentation process?",
        "answer": "Alpha matting improves the segmentation edges by making them more precise and natural-looking, based on specified foreground and background thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImageSegmentation node?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentation node outputs segmented images where the foreground is separated from the background, suitable for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What session types does the ImageSegmentation node use?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentation node uses session types such as 'isnet-anime' for 'isnetis', ModnetPhotographicSession for 'modnet-p', and ModnetWebcamSession for 'modnet-w', depending on the selected segmentation model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageSegmentation node handle post-processing of the segmented mask?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentation node optionally applies post-processing to enhance the quality of the segmented mask."
