        "question": "What is the 'Image Generate Gradient' node used for in the 'WAS Suite' category of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Generate Gradient' node is used to create images with gradient effects based on specified color stops, direction, and size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you specify the width of the generated gradient image in ComfyUI's 'Image Generate Gradient' node?",
        "answer": "You can specify the width of the generated gradient image by using the 'width' input which is of type 'INT' and determines how wide the image will be."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the direction in which the gradient transition occurs in the 'Image Generate Gradient' node?",
        "answer": "The direction of the gradient transition in the image is determined by the 'direction' input, which can be set to either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'tolerance' input play in the 'Image Generate Gradient' node?",
        "answer": "The 'tolerance' input adjusts the tolerance for color transitions in the gradient, affecting the smoothness of the gradient effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the color stops for the gradient defined using the 'Image Generate Gradient' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The color stops for the gradient are defined by the 'gradient_stops' input, specifying the colors and their positions within the gradient transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Image Generate Gradient' node output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Image Generate Gradient' node outputs a generated image with the specified gradient effect, denoted by the output type 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which python data type does the 'gradient_stops' input use in the 'Image Generate Gradient' node?",
        "answer": "The 'gradient_stops' input uses the python data type 'str' (string)."
