        "question": "What is the input type of `image` in the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The input type of `image` in the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor is an image on which body poses will be estimated and visualized, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which DensePose models are supported by the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The supported DensePose models by Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor are 'densepose_r50_fpn_dl.torchscript' and 'densepose_r101_fpn_dl.torchscript'."

        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor node is an image with human body poses estimated and visualized on it, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the optional input `model` in the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the optional input `model` in the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor is `COMBO[STRING]` in Comfy and `str` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_DensePosePreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Faces and Poses Estimators' category."
