        "question": "What is VAESave?",
        "answer": "VAESave is a node in ComfyUI designed for saving VAE (Variational Autoencoder) models along with associated metadata and prompts to a specified output directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does VAESave serialize and store?",
        "answer": "VAESave serializes and stores the state of the VAE model provided as input, along with its associated metadata and prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by VAESave?",
        "answer": "VAESave requires a VAE model ('vae') and a filename prefix ('filename_prefix') under which the serialized model and metadata will be saved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of VAESave?",
        "answer": "VAESave does not have any output types specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does VAESave facilitate model preservation?",
        "answer": "VAESave facilitates model preservation by encapsulating functionality to save the state of the VAE model into a file, ensuring the trained model can be shared and retrieved."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does VAESave belong?",
        "answer": "VAESave belongs to the 'advanced/model_merging' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does VAESave require?",
        "answer": "VAESave operates on CPU infrastructure."
