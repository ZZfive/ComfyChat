        "question": "What does the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node do in the Animate Diff framework?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node in the Animate Diff framework is designed to aggregate and combine up to four LoRA hooks into a single, unified LoRA hook group, facilitating the integration of multiple LoRA hook modifications for more complex adjustments to model behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of LoRA hooks can be combined using the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node can combine the LoRA hooks lora_hook_A, lora_hook_B, lora_hook_C, and lora_hook_D, each represented by the Python dtype LoraHookGroup and the Comfy dtype LORA_HOOK."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can integrate multiple LoRA hook modifications in the Animate Diff framework?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node can integrate multiple LoRA hook modifications in the Animate Diff framework, allowing for more complex and nuanced adjustments to model behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node is `lora_hook` with the Comfy dtype of `LORA_HOOK` and the Python dtype of `LoraHookGroup`. It represents the result of combining up to four LoRA hooks into a single, unified group, enabling enhanced and more complex model conditioning."

    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node contribute to the model's adaptability in the Animate Diff framework?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node contributes to the model's adaptability in the Animate Diff framework by allowing the layering and combination of multiple LoRA hook modifications, thus enabling more complex and nuanced adjustments to the model's behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python function responsible for the operation of the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node?",
        "answer": "The Python function responsible for the operation of the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node is `combine_lora_hooks`, which combines up to four LoRA hooks into a single, unified group."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is required to run the ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node in Animate Diff?",
        "answer": "The ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour node in Animate Diff requires an infrastructure type of `CPU` to run."
