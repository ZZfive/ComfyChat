        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeSamplerInputs node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeSamplerInputs node is designed to manage and provide sampler and scheduler configurations for sampling processes, facilitating the customization and optimization of sampling operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SeargeSamplerInputs node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SeargeSamplerInputs node are `sampler_name` and `scheduler`. The `sampler_name` specifies the sampler to be used, while the `scheduler` determines the scheduling strategy during sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeSamplerInputs node handle the selection of sampling strategies?",
        "answer": "The SeargeSamplerInputs node offers predefined options and defaults for selecting appropriate sampling strategies, abstracting the complexity and facilitating the customization of sampling operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the SeargeSamplerInputs node?",
        "answer": "The output types provided by the SeargeSamplerInputs node are `sampler_name` and `scheduler`, reflecting the choices made for the sampling process and indicating the scheduling strategy employed for sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `sampler_name` parameter used in the SeargeSamplerInputs node?",
        "answer": "The `sampler_name` parameter in the SeargeSamplerInputs node specifies the name of the sampler to be used, allowing selection among various predefined samplers to influence the sampling behavior and results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are common when using the SeargeSamplerInputs node?",
        "answer": "A common node when using the SeargeSamplerInputs node is the `SeargeSDXLSamplerV3`, found in the `SeargeSDXL/Nodes` section."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is associated with the SeargeSamplerInputs node?",
        "answer": "The `infra type` associated with the SeargeSamplerInputs node is `CPU`."
