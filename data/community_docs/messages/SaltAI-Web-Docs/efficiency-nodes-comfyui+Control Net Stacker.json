        "question": "What is the Control Net Stacker node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Control Net Stacker node is designed to aggregate control networks along with their associated images, strengths, and percentage ranges into a stack, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of image manipulation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type of the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type of the Control Net Stacker node is CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `strength` input in the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The `strength` input in the Control Net Stacker node defines the intensity of the control network's effect on the image, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the Control Net Stacker node determines the temporal precision of the control network's application?",
        "answer": "The `end_percent` input determines the ending point of the control network's effect, further refining the application's temporal precision."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Control Net Stacker node output?",
        "answer": "The Control Net Stacker node outputs an updated stack of control networks (`CNET_STACK`), each associated with specific images, strengths, and percentage ranges, ready for sequential or layered application."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the Control Net Stacker node is associated with an existing stack of control networks?",
        "answer": "The `cnet_stack` input is associated with an existing stack of control networks to which the new control network will be added, facilitating the accumulation of multiple networks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What other node is commonly used with the Control Net Stacker node?",
        "answer": "The Efficient Loader node is commonly used with the Control Net Stacker node."
