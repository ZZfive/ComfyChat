        "question": "What is the FaceEmbedDistance node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceEmbedDistance node in ComfyUI is designed to extract facial embeddings from images using specified face analysis models, supporting different libraries for detection and embedding extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the face analysis models to use in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The `analysis_models` input specifies the face analysis models to be used in the FaceEmbedDistance node for detecting faces and extracting embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `generate_image_overlay` input in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The `generate_image_overlay` input in the FaceEmbedDistance node determines whether to generate an overlay image showing the comparison results between the reference and target faces, enhancing visual analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `filter_best` input control in the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The `filter_best` input in the FaceEmbedDistance node controls the number of best matches to retain after filtering based on specified Euclidean and cosine similarity thresholds."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the cosine similarity output computed by the FaceEmbedDistance node?",
        "answer": "The cosine similarity output in the FaceEmbedDistance node provides a measure of similarity between faces based on cosine similarity, comparing the orientation of the face embeddings in vector space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of data output by the FaceEmbedDistance node and how are they described?",
        "answer": "The FaceEmbedDistance node outputs an `IMAGE`, a list of `FLOAT` for Euclidean distances, and a list of `FLOAT` for cosine similarities. These outputs represent visual representations of analysis, precise face comparisons based on Euclidean distance, and orientation-based similarity measures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the `generate_image_overlay` input and what does it imply for the node's operation?",
        "answer": "The default value for `generate_image_overlay` input is `True`, implying that the node will generate an image overlay showing the comparison results by default."
