        "question": "What is the InvCosWave node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InvCosWave node in ComfyUI is used to generate an inverse cosine wave based on specified parameters such as phase, amplitude, and translations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the InvCosWave node under FizzNodes?",
        "answer": "The InvCosWave node is categorized under FizzNodes in the WaveNodes section."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'phase' parameter affect the wave pattern generated by the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the InvCosWave node controls the period of the wave, affecting how stretched or compressed the wave appears over its cycle. A larger phase value results in a more stretched wave, impacting the frequency of the wave pattern generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'amplitude' parameter determine in the InvCosWave node output?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter in the InvCosWave node determines the height of the wave's peaks, influencing the wave's overall intensity. Higher amplitude values produce waves with greater peak-to-trough distances, affecting the visual and numerical amplitude of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'x_translation' affect the visualization of the wave pattern in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_translation' parameter in the InvCosWave node shifts the wave along the x-axis, allowing for adjustments in the wave's starting position. This shift can alter the phase of the wave, affecting where the wave begins within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does 'y_translation' play in the InvCosWave node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'y_translation' parameter in the InvCosWave node shifts the wave along the y-axis, adjusting the baseline level of the wave. This influences the vertical positioning of the wave, affecting its alignment relative to the y-axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'current_frame' parameter in the InvCosWave node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in the InvCosWave node specifies the current point in the wave's cycle, used to calculate the wave's value at that specific moment. This parameter is crucial for animating the wave over time, determining the wave's position at each frame."
