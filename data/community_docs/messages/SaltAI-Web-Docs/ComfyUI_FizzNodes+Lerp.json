        "question": "What is the Lerp node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node in ComfyUI is used for linearly interpolating between two values based on a given strength and the current frame within a specified number of images, making it useful for animations or gradual changes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the Lerp node produce?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node produces a floating-point result of the linear interpolation and an integer representation of the interpolated value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Lerp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node in ComfyUI requires 'num_Images' (FLOAT), 'strength' (FLOAT), and 'current_frame' (INT) as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'current_frame' input determine the output of the Lerp node?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' input in the Lerp node is used to calculate the specific interpolation value for that frame, determining the output at each step during the transition across frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'step' used for in the Lerp node's calculations?",
        "answer": "In the Lerp node, 'step' is used to calculate the change in output per frame, determined by the division of 'strength' by 'num_Images'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can provide a linear interpolation output?",
        "answer": "The Lerp node in ComfyUI can provide a linear interpolation output by smoothly transitioning or blending values across a sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Lerp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Lerp node in ComfyUI is 'Lerp'."
