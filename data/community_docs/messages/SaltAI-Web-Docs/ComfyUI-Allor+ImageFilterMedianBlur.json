        "question": "What does ImageFilterMedianBlur's node function do?",
        "answer": "The node function of ImageFilterMedianBlur applies a median blur filter to input images, adjusting the blurring effect based on the size of the kernel."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageFilterMedianBlur handle noise in images?",
        "answer": "ImageFilterMedianBlur handles noise in images by applying a median blur filter, which effectively reduces salt-and-pepper noise while preserving the edges of objects."
