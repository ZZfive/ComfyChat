        "question": "What is the Number Multiple Of node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Number Multiple Of node in ComfyUI is designed to determine if a given number is a multiple of another specified number and adjust the number to the next multiple if it isn't, ensuring alignment to specific numerical intervals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the number input into the Number Multiple Of node is not a multiple of the specified multiple?",
        "answer": "If the number input into the Number Multiple Of node is not a multiple of the specified multiple, the node adjusts the number to the next closest multiple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter in the Number Multiple Of node represents the base value against which the number is checked?",
        "answer": "The parameter `multiple` in the Number Multiple Of node represents the base value against which the number is checked to determine if it is a multiple."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the Number Multiple Of node provide?",
        "answer": "The Number Multiple Of node provides output types of NUMBER, FLOAT, and INT, representing the original number if it is a multiple, or the next closest multiple in various numeric formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the `multiple` parameter in the Number Multiple Of node?",
