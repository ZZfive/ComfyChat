        "question": "What does the LLMVectorStoreIndex node do?",
        "answer": "The LLMVectorStoreIndex node creates an index from a collection of documents using a language model to generate embeddings for efficient retrieval and similarity searches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMVectorStoreIndex node are `llm_model`, which specifies the language model used for generating embeddings, and `document`, which is the collection of documents to be indexed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `llm_model` input in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The `llm_model` input in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node specifies the language model to be used for generating embeddings, determining the semantic representation of the documents."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can customize the embedding process in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The `optional_llm_context` input in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is an optional context provided to the language model, which can customize the embedding process based on specific requirements or contexts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is an index created from the documents, structured for efficient retrieval and similarity searches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the `document` input in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the `document` input in the LLMVectorStoreIndex node is `DOCUMENT`, which represents the collection of documents to be indexed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What exception does the LLMVectorStoreIndex node raise if the embedding model is not determined?",
        "answer": "The LLMVectorStoreIndex node raises a `ValueError` if the embedding model is not determined."
