        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImpactInversedSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactInversedSwitch node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively invert an input signal based on a specified condition, allowing for dynamic control flow and decision-making within a node network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines whether the input signal is inverted in the ImpactInversedSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input determines whether the input signal is inverted in the ImpactInversedSwitch node, based on its value and type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the 'select' input of the ImpactInversedSwitch node reference another node's output?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 'select' input of the ImpactInversedSwitch node can be a reference to another node's output, allowing for dynamic and conditional signal inversion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'input' parameter in the ImpactInversedSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'input' parameter in the ImpactInversedSwitch node can accept any data type ('*'), representing the signal to be potentially inverted based on the 'select' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactInversedSwitch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactInversedSwitch node in ComfyUI matches the input data type ('*'), with the signal potentially inverted based on the 'select' condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'select' input in the ImpactInversedSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'select' input in the ImpactInversedSwitch node is `Union[int, list]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'Infra type' of the ImpactInversedSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The 'Infra type' of the ImpactInversedSwitch node is 'CPU'."
