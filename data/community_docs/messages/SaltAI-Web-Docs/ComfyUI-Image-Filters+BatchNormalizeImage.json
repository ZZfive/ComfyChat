        "question": "What is the BatchNormalizeImage node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "BatchNormalizeImage is a node in ComfyUI designed to normalize a batch of images based on a given factor, adjusting each image's pixel values for consistency in further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input requirements for BatchNormalizeImage?",
        "answer": "BatchNormalizeImage requires two inputs: 'images' which is a batch of images represented as torch.Tensor in the IMAGE data type, and 'factor', a float that controls the blending of the original images with the normalized versions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'images' parameter in the BatchNormalizeImage node?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in BatchNormalizeImage represents the batch of images to be normalized, directly influencing the computation of mean and standard deviation required for the normalization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' parameter influence in BatchNormalizeImage?",
        "answer": "In BatchNormalizeImage, the 'factor' parameter determines the extent to which the original images are blended with their normalized versions, affecting the final appearance of the normalized images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BatchNormalizeImage node and in what data type?",
        "answer": "The output of BatchNormalizeImage is a batch of normalized images in the 'IMAGE' data type, represented by torch.Tensor, suitable for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes blend original images with their normalized versions based on a given factor?",
        "answer": "The BatchNormalizeImage node in ComfyUI blends original images with their normalized versions based on a given 'factor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the BatchNormalizeImage node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "BatchNormalizeImage falls under the 'image/filters' category in ComfyUI."
