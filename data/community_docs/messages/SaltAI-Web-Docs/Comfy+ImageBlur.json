        "question": "What is ImageBlur in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImageBlur is a node in ComfyUI that applies a Gaussian blur to an input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageBlur reduce image noise?",
        "answer": "ImageBlur reduces image noise by applying a Gaussian blur with a specified radius and sigma value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageBlur node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageBlur node include an input image as a torch.Tensor, a blur radius specified as an integer, and a sigma value specified as a float."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the blur_radius affect the blurring effect in ImageBlur?",
        "answer": "The blur_radius parameter in ImageBlur specifies the radius of the Gaussian blur effect, where a larger radius results in a more pronounced blurring effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the sigma parameter determine in ImageBlur?",
        "answer": "In ImageBlur, the sigma parameter determines the spread of the Gaussian blur effect, affecting the smoothness of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageBlur node return as output?",
        "answer": "The ImageBlur node returns an output image after applying the Gaussian blur, returned as a torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is recommended for using the ImageBlur node?",
        "answer": "The ImageBlur node is recommended to be used with GPU infrastructures."
