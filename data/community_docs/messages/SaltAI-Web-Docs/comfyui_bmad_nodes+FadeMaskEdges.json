        "question": "What is the purpose of the FadeMaskEdges node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FadeMaskEdges node in ComfyUI is designed to premultiply and alpha blend the edges of a subject to prevent outer pixels from creeping in, making it particularly useful for stylized subjects such as drawings with black outlines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FadeMaskEdges node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FadeMaskEdges node belongs to the 'Bmad/CV/Misc' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'binary_image' input in the FadeMaskEdges node?",
        "answer": "The 'binary_image' input in the FadeMaskEdges node is the binary image to be processed, specifically for premultiplying and alpha blending its edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'edge_exponent' parameter affect the output of the FadeMaskEdges node?",
        "answer": "The 'edge_exponent' parameter in the FadeMaskEdges node determines the fade curve, allowing for customization of the edge transition effect when blending the subject into the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the 'edge_tightness' parameter in the FadeMaskEdges node?",
        "answer": "The 'edge_tightness' parameter in the FadeMaskEdges node controls the tightness of the edge fade, affecting the transition smoothness from the subject to the background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of preprocessing might be required after using the 'paste_original_blacks' flag in the FadeMaskEdges node?",
        "answer": "After using the 'paste_original_blacks' flag in the FadeMaskEdges node, a very slight blur near the edges may be required when using low tightness levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the node used for controlling the blending of mask edges in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node used for controlling the blending of mask edges in ComfyUI is 'FadeMaskEdges'."
