        "question": "What is the OpenposePreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The OpenposePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for estimating human poses from images, leveraging the OpenPose model to detect and annotate keypoints on the human body, face, and hands."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the OpenposePreprocessor node belong to?",
        "answer": "The OpenposePreprocessor node belongs to the category 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Faces and Poses Estimators'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional inputs for the OpenposePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the OpenposePreprocessor node is the input image. The optional inputs include detect_hand, detect_body, detect_face, and resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the detect_hand input in the OpenposePreprocessor node do?",
        "answer": "The detect_hand input in the OpenposePreprocessor node is used to specify whether hand keypoints should be detected during the pose estimation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the resolution input in the OpenposePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution input in the OpenposePreprocessor node determines the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing, which can impact detection accuracy and computational load."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used by the ComfyUI for the input and output of the OpenposePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The input images are of dtype 'IMAGE' and 'torch.Tensor'. The output includes 'IMAGE', 'POSE_KEYPOINT', and a JSON representation of the detected keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used alongside the OpenposePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes with the OpenposePreprocessor include PreviewImage, CR Multi-ControlNet Stack, ControlNetApply, ImageScaleToTotalPixels, Reroute, and VHS_VideoCombine."
