        "question": "How does the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node control the quality and style of the output audio?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node controls the quality and style of the output audio through the selection of the AudioLDM2 model used for generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters can you adjust to influence the generated audio with SaltAudioLDM2Sampler?",
        "answer": "You can adjust parameters like seed, steps, guidance scale, audio_length_seconds, and number of waveforms to influence the generated audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in SaltAudioLDM2Sampler determines the randomness of the audio generation process?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' parameter determines the randomness seed for audio generation, enabling the creation of reproducible outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'num_waveforms' parameter control in the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_waveforms' parameter determines the number of audio waveforms to generate, enabling multiple outputs from a single prompt in the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You can find the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node in the 'SALT/Audio/AudioLDM2' category of ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node is 'AUDIO', which is the generated audio waveform as a result of the sampling process."
