        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image inputs for further processing by applying a tiling mechanism. This involves detecting and adjusting image tiles to improve the quality and consistency of the input images for subsequent stages in a pipeline, particularly in control networks."

        "question": "What is the class name of the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node is `Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node is `image`, which is the input image to be processed and enhanced through the tiling mechanism."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `pyrUp_iters` parameter in the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor do?",
        "answer": "The `pyrUp_iters` parameter in the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor specifies the number of iterations for the pyramid upscaling process, affecting the granularity of the tile adjustment. This parameter plays a crucial role in determining the level of detail and the scale of adjustments applied to the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input type does the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node use to set the target resolution?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node has an optional input type `resolution` that sets the target resolution for the output image, influencing the final size and detail level after processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node is `image`, which produces an enhanced version of the input image, where tiling adjustments have been applied to improve its suitability for further processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type required for the Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_TilePreprocessor node requires an infra type of `CPU`."
