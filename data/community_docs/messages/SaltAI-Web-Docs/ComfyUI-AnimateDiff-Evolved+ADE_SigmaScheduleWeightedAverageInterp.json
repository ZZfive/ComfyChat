        "question": "What is ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to create a new sigma schedule by interpolating between two given sigma schedules based on a specified weight range and interpolation method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp allow you to do?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp allows you to blend the characteristics of two input sigma schedules into a new schedule using a weighted average."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp?",
        "answer": "The input types required for ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp include 'schedule_A' and 'schedule_B', which are sigma schedules to be interpolated, 'weight_A_Start' and 'weight_A_End' defining the range for the first schedule's weight, and 'interpolation' specifying the method of interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp blend sigma schedules?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp blends sigma schedules by calculating new sigmas based on weighted averages of the input schedules, using weights derived from the specified interpolation method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp?",
        "answer": "The output type of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp is a sigma schedule, which represents the resulting schedule after interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp be used in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp can be used in ComfyUI to dynamically adjust diffusion processes by creating customized sigma schedules that blend characteristics from different input schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code structure of ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp?",
        "answer": "ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp is implemented in Python as a class named InterpolatedWeightedAverageSigmaScheduleNode. It defines input types such as 'schedule_A', 'schedule_B', 'weight_A_Start', 'weight_A_End', and 'interpolation', and includes a method 'get_sigma_schedule' for generating the interpolated sigma schedule."
