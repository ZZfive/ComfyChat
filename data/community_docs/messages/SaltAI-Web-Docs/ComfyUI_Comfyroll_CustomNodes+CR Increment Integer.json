        "question": "What is the CR Increment Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CR Increment Integer is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for incrementally adjusting integer values over a sequence of frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Increment Integer node and what do they represent?",
        "answer": "The required input types are: start_value (the initial integer value); step (the fixed amount added at each increment step); start_frame (the frame at which the increment operation begins); frame_duration (the duration over which the increment operation is applied); and current_frame (the current frame being processed)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'start_value' input type in the CR Increment Integer node represent and what is its dtype?",
        "answer": "The 'start_value' in the CR Increment Integer node represents the initial integer value from which the increment operation begins. Its dtype is INT in Comfy and int in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the increment operation controlled over time in the CR Increment Integer node?",
        "answer": "The increment operation is controlled by 'start_frame' (the frame at which the increment operation commences) and 'frame_duration' (the duration over which the increment operation is applied), allowing for controlled adjustments within a specified timeframe."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CR Increment Integer node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CR Increment Integer node are an integer (INT) representing the resulting integer value after applying the increment operation and a string (STRING) providing a URL for additional help and documentation related to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_help' output type in the CR Increment Integer node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output type in the CR Increment Integer node provides a URL to access additional help and documentation related to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'step' input type in the CR Increment Integer node?",
        "answer": "The 'step' input type in the CR Increment Integer node represents the fixed amount added to 'start_value' at each increment step, allowing for consistent or variable progression of the value across frames."
