        "question": "What is the purpose of the Create Morph Image from Path node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Create Morph Image from Path node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a morphing animation between a sequence of images stored in a specified directory, facilitating the creation of dynamic visual content by automating the morphing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter determines the number of frames used for transitioning between images when using the Create Morph Image from Path node?",
        "answer": "The parameter that determines the number of frames used for transitioning between images is `transition_frames`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `still_image_delay_ms` parameter control in the Create Morph Image from Path node?",
        "answer": "The `still_image_delay_ms` parameter controls the delay in milliseconds for each still image before transitioning, allowing for a pause on each image in the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the `duration_ms` parameter have on the animation created by the Create Morph Image from Path node?",
        "answer": "The `duration_ms` parameter sets the duration in milliseconds for each frame in the animation, controlling the speed of the morphing effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the output file name of the GIF animation created by the Create Morph Image from Path node be customized?",
        "answer": "The output file name of the GIF animation can be customized using the `filename` parameter, which allows you to define the name of the file without the extension."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are best used for generating animations between a sequence of images?",
        "answer": "The Create Morph Image from Path node in ComfyUI is best used for generating animations between a sequence of images, as it automates the morphing process and allows for customization of various animation parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `loops` parameter in the Create Morph Image from Path node?",
        "answer": "The `loops` parameter defines how many times the animation will loop, with a value of 0 indicating an infinite loop."
