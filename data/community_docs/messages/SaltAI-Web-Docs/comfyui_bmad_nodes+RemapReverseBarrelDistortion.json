        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a reverse barrel distortion effect to images, allowing for the correction of images that have been distorted by a barrel distortion typically caused by lens imperfections."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used for correcting barrel distortion?",
        "answer": "The RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node is used to correct barrel distortion in images by applying a reverse barrel distortion effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the coefficient 'a' play in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'a' in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node influences the primary distortion effect and plays a crucial role in the reverse barrel distortion correction process. Its value directly alters the curvature of the image, impacting the intensity of the correction applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_inverse_variant' parameter affect the operation of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_inverse_variant' parameter is a boolean that determines whether an inverse variant of the distortion formula is used in the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node, affecting the overall distortion correction method and potentially leading to different visual outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI is a remapped image with the reverse barrel distortion applied, correcting the original distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node falls under the category of 'Bmad/CV/Transform' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the common infrastructure type used by the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node?",
        "answer": "The common infrastructure type used by the RemapReverseBarrelDistortion node is 'CPU'."
