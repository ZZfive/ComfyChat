        "question": "What is ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "ImageSegmentationCustom is a class in ComfyUI specialized in custom image segmentation tasks, offering advanced configurations and models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageSegmentationCustom node specialize in?",
        "answer": "The ImageSegmentationCustom node specializes in custom image segmentation tasks, aiming to precisely delineate and separate different elements within images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "The input types required for ImageSegmentationCustom include 'images', 'model', 'alpha_matting', 'alpha_matting_foreground_threshold', 'alpha_matting_background_threshold', 'alpha_matting_erode_size', 'post_process_mask', 'mean', 'std', and 'size'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the alpha_matting parameter influence ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "The alpha_matting parameter in ImageSegmentationCustom determines whether alpha matting should be applied to improve the segmentation's edge quality, enhancing the precision of the segmented image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the post_process_mask parameter in ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "The post_process_mask parameter in ImageSegmentationCustom indicates whether post-processing should be applied to the segmentation mask to refine its quality, such as smoothing edges or removing noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageSegmentationCustom is 'IMAGE', providing segmented images where different elements are precisely delineated and separated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type recommended for using ImageSegmentationCustom?",
        "answer": "The Infra type recommended for using ImageSegmentationCustom is 'GPU'."
