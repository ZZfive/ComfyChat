        "question": "What is the purpose of the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node is designed for advanced tiled sampling without the need for smooth steps or a refiner, optimizing the generation process for specific scenarios where these elements are not required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `base_model` parameter in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node specify?",
        "answer": "The `base_model` parameter in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node specifies the primary model used for generating the tiles, serving as the foundation for the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node are used to guide and steer the base model towards desired and undesired characteristics?",
        "answer": "The `positive_cond_base` and `negative_cond_base` parameters in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node are used to guide and steer the base model towards desired and undesired characteristics in the generated tiles, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `upscale_by` parameter in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node affect the generation of tiles?",
        "answer": "The `upscale_by` parameter in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node determines the factor by which the generated tiles are upscaled, affecting the resolution and detail of the final output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `return_types` attribute of the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node indicate?",
        "answer": "The `return_types` attribute of the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node indicates the data type of the output generated by the node, which is `IMAGE`, reflecting the final generated image after the advanced tiled sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can an initial image be used instead of latent space samples in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "An initial image can be used instead of latent space samples in the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node by providing the `image_optional` parameter, which, if not none, replaces samples with the decoded image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for the MikeySamplerTiledAdvancedBaseOnly node is `GPU`."
