        "question": "What custom node in ComfyUI is designed for creating masks from a list of values?",
        "answer": "The `MaskFromList+` node is designed for creating masks from a list of values in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `MaskFromList+` node output?",
        "answer": "The `MaskFromList+` node outputs a `mask` which is a `torch.Tensor` of type `MASK` representing the custom mask created based on the provided values and dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the width of the mask in the `MaskFromList+` node?",
        "answer": "The `width` parameter specifies the width of the mask to be generated in the `MaskFromList+` node, determining the horizontal dimension of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `values` parameter in the `MaskFromList+` node?",
        "answer": "The `values` parameter is a list of floating-point numbers representing the intensity values for the mask in the `MaskFromList+` node, with each value corresponding to a pixel's intensity in the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type of the `values` parameter in the `MaskFromList+` node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type of the `values` parameter in the `MaskFromList+` node is `List[float]`, representing a list of floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the `MaskFromList+` node, which input parameter determines the vertical dimension of the mask?",
        "answer": "The `height` parameter defines the vertical dimension of the mask to be generated in the `MaskFromList+` node, affecting the mask's size and aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class type is associated with the `MaskFromList+` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `MaskFromList+` node in ComfyUI is associated with the `MaskFromList` class type."
