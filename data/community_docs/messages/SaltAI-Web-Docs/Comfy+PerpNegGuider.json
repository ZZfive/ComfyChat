        "question": "What is the PerpNegGuider node?",
        "answer": "The PerpNegGuider node is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to guide the generation process using perpendicular negative conditioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the PerpNegGuider node adjust during generation?",
        "answer": "The PerpNegGuider node adjusts the generation process towards positive conditions while avoiding specified negative conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the PerpNegGuider node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PerpNegGuider node include: model (generative model), positive (desired conditions), negative (undesired conditions), empty_conditioning (baseline for conditioning), cfg (strength of conditioning), and neg_scale (scale of negative conditioning)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the cfg parameter control in the PerpNegGuider node?",
        "answer": "The cfg parameter controls the overall strength of conditioning, determining how strongly positive and negative conditions influence the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the PerpNegGuider node generate a guider object?",
        "answer": "The PerpNegGuider node generates a guider object by applying the specified positive and negative conditions to guide the generative model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does the guider object returned by PerpNegGuider have?",
        "answer": "The guider object returned by PerpNegGuider has a Python dtype of `Guider_PerpNeg`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the PerpNegGuider node's neg_scale parameter?",
        "answer": "The neg_scale parameter in the PerpNegGuider node adjusts the scale of negative conditioning, controlling how strongly negative conditions are avoided during generation."
