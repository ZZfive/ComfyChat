        "question": "What is the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate multiple batches of floating-point numbers into a unified batch, optionally reversing the order of the batches before combining them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node belongs to the 'mtb/batch' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `reverse` input option in the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node do?",
        "answer": "The `reverse` input option in the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node determines whether the input batches of floats should be reversed before being assembled into a single batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for the `reverse` input of the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for the `reverse` input of the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node is `BOOLEAN` in Comfy and `bool` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node is `FLOATS`, represented as `list[float]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node produce when it assembles the input data?",
        "answer": "When the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node assembles the input data, it produces a single batch of floats, assembled from the input batches, providing a streamlined dataset for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node modify the order of the assembled batches?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Batch Float Assemble (mtb) node can modify the order of the assembled batches based on the `reverse` input option."
