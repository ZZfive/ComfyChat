        "question": "What is the primary function of the ImpactMakeTileSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeTileSEGS node is designed to generate tiled versions of segmentation masks based on specified bounding box sizes and overlap parameters, accommodating for both inclusion and exclusion criteria while respecting the original segmentation's integrity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to preview the results generated by ImpactMakeTileSEGS?",
        "answer": "The SEGSPreview node can be used to preview the results generated by ImpactMakeTileSEGS."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `images` input accept in the ImpactMakeTileSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `images` input accepts a list of images, with the Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and the Python dtype of `List[Image]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactMakeTileSEGS node handle the size of the bounding box for each tile?",
        "answer": "The size of the bounding box for each tile is determined by the `bbox_size` input, which directly influences the granularity of the tiling output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `crop_factor` input in the ImpactMakeTileSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_factor` input influences the cropping of images during the tiling process, affecting the size and area of the resulting tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node inputs control the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the segmentation masks?",
        "answer": "The `filter_in_segs_opt` and `filter_out_segs_opt` inputs control the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the segmentation masks, allowing for targeted tiling within specified regions of interest and removing undesired segments from the tiling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the ImpactMakeTileSEGS node output?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMakeTileSEGS node outputs segmented tiles, with the dtype of `SEGS`, each representing a portion of the original image with applied filters and adjustments for tiling."
