        "question": "What is the SaltListLinearInterpolation node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "SaltListLinearInterpolation is a node in ComfyUI designed to perform linear interpolation between two lists of schedule values based on a specified interpolation factor, creating smooth transitions between different states or values in a schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `schedule_list_a` input in the SaltListLinearInterpolation node?",
        "answer": "The `schedule_list_a` input is the first list of schedule values to interpolate from and serves as the starting point for the interpolation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `schedule_list_b` input in the SaltListLinearInterpolation node?",
        "answer": "The `schedule_list_b` input is the second list of schedule values to interpolate towards and acts as the target endpoint for the interpolation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `interpolation_factor` input affect the output of the SaltListLinearInterpolation node?",
        "answer": "The `interpolation_factor` input is a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines the weight of each input list in the interpolated output. A factor of 0.0 yields the first list, while 1.0 yields the second list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltListLinearInterpolation node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltListLinearInterpolation node is a resulting list of interpolated schedule values, blending the input lists `schedule_list_a` and `schedule_list_b` according to the `interpolation_factor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is SaltListLinearInterpolation in terms of output status in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltListLinearInterpolation is an output node with the status of `False` in ComfyUI, indicating it does not have an output status but provides a data output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the node SaltListLinearInterpolation and where is it categorized?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node is `SaltListLinearInterpolation` and it is categorized under `SALT/Scheduling/Filter` in ComfyUI."
