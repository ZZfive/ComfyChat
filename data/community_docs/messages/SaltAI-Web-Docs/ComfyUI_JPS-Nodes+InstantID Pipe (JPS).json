        "question": "What is the InstantID Pipe (JPS) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to process settings for instant identification features, encapsulating the logic to handle various parameters and returning processed settings for further use in identification tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the InstantID Pipe (JPS) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe (JPS) node belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Pipes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of the inputs for the InstantID Pipe (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe (JPS) node has a single required input type, `instantid_settings`, which is of the Comfy dtype `BASIC_PIPE` and Python dtype `Tuple[float, float, float, float, float]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `instantid_settings` input represent?",
        "answer": "The `instantid_settings` input defines the settings for instant identification, including parameters like weight, strength, noise, start, and end."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the InstantID Pipe (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The InstantID Pipe (JPS) node outputs `ip_weight`, `cn_strength`, `noise`, `start`, and `end`, each corresponding to the respective parameters it processes, all of dtype `FLOAT` in Comfy and `float` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the `instantid_settings` influence the identification process's robustness?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' parameter in the `instantid_settings` influences the robustness of the identification process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'weight' parameter in the identification settings?",
        "answer": "The 'weight' parameter in the identification settings adjusts the emphasis on certain features in the identification process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `noise` parameter in the `instantid_settings` represent?",
        "answer": "The `noise` parameter in the `instantid_settings` can simulate variability in identification scenarios."
