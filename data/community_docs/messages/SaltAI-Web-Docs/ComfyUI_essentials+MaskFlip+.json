        "question": "What is the MaskFlip+ node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The MaskFlip+ node in ComfyUI is designed to flip a given mask along specified axes, enabling the manipulation of mask orientation in image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which axes can the MaskFlip+ node flip the mask along?",
        "answer": "The MaskFlip+ node can flip the mask along the 'x', 'y', or 'xy' axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the 'mask' input of the MaskFlip+ node require?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' input of the MaskFlip+ node requires a Python data type of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the 'axis' input of the MaskFlip+ node require?",
        "answer": "The 'axis' input of the MaskFlip+ node requires a Python data type of `Tuple[str]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the MaskFlip+ node?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the MaskFlip+ node is `MASK`, which is represented by a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the MaskFlip+ node require?",
        "answer": "The MaskFlip+ node requires an infrastructure type of 'GPU'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MaskFlip+ node determine which axes to flip the mask along?",
        "answer": "The MaskFlip+ node determines which axes to flip the mask along based on the 'axis' input parameter, which is either 'x', 'y', or 'xy'."
