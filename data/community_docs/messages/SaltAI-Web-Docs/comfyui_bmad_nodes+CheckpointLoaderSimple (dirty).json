        "question": "What is the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is designed to simplify the process of loading model checkpoints in a less conventional or 'dirty' manner, automating the process of finding the appropriate checkpoint file based on a given name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class implements the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is implemented by the `DirtyCheckpointLoaderSimple` class in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The Infra type of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node automates the model checkpoint loading process in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node automates the model checkpoint loading process in ComfyUI by automatically finding and utilizing the appropriate checkpoint file based on a given name."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the RETURN_TYPES of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RETURN_TYPES of the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node in ComfyUI are `MODEL`, `CLIP`, and `VAE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `ckpt_name` parameter specify in the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` parameter in the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node specifies the name of the checkpoint file to be loaded, which the node then automates the process of finding the matching filename for easier model loading."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node, how is the loaded model from the specified checkpoint represented?",
        "answer": "In the CheckpointLoaderSimple (dirty) node, the loaded model from the specified checkpoint is represented by the `model` output, which is of type `torch.nn.Module` and is ready for further use or analysis."
