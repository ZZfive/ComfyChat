        "question": "What does the CR Aspect Ratio node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Aspect Ratio node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the aspect ratio of images, ensuring they fit specific dimensions or standards."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters can you set to control the output image size in the CR Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The CR Aspect Ratio node allows you to specify the desired `width` and `height` for the output image as well as the `aspect_ratio` to apply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `swap_dimensions` parameter in the CR Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The `swap_dimensions` parameter in the CR Aspect Ratio node determines whether the width and height dimensions should be swapped, which is useful for rotating images or changing their orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Aspect Ratio node handle upscaled images?",
        "answer": "The CR Aspect Ratio node uses the `upscale_factor` parameter to specify the factor by which the image should be upscaled, which is important for enhancing image quality in larger displays."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `prescale_factor` in the CR Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The `prescale_factor` parameter in the CR Aspect Ratio node specifies the factor by which the image should be prescaled before applying the aspect ratio adjustments, helping in optimizing the processing for different image sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `batch_size` parameter utilized in the CR Aspect Ratio node?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` parameter defines the number of images to process in a single batch, which is crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization during batch processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the CR Aspect Ratio node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Aspect Ratio node provides outputs including the adjusted `width` and `height` of the image, the `upscale_factor` and `prescale_factor` applied, the `batch_size`, a `empty_latent` tensor, and a `show_help` URL for more information."
