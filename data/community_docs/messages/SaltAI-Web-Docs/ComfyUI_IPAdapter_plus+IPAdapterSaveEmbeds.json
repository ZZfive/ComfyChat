        "question": "What is the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node in ComfyUI is designed for saving embedding data to a file, facilitating the persistence of computed embeddings for later use or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node are `embeds` (EMBEDS, torch.Tensor) and `filename_prefix` (STRING, str)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'embeds' parameter in the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node?",
        "answer": "The 'embeds' parameter in the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node represents the embedding data to be saved, which contains the actual data that needs to be persisted."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterSaveEmbeds node belongs to the 'ipadapter/embeds' category in ComfyUI."
