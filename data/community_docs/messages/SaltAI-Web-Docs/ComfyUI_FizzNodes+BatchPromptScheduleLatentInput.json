        "question": "What is the class name for the node that processes animation prompts for batch scheduling with latent inputs?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input) node is `BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input) node?",
        "answer": "The Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input) node is designed to sequence formatted prompts into current and next prompts with conditioning strength, evaluate expressions within these prompts, and apply a scheduling algorithm to generate a batch of conditionings tailored to the input latent values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the node emphasize in the animation process?",
        "answer": "The node emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of text-based animation prompts to the temporal dimension of animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the printing of the output in the Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input) node?",
        "answer": "The parameter that controls whether the output of the animation process is printed is `print_output`, and it is of the Boolean data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the four weight parameters in Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input)?",
        "answer": "The four weight parameters in `BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput` are `pw_a`, `pw_b`, `pw_c`, and `pw_d`, which are used to adjust the prompt weighting in the scheduling algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is essential for generating the animation and provides the clip information?",
        "answer": "The `clip` parameter is essential for generating the animation as it provides the clip information required for the process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used in combination with Batch Prompt Schedule (Latent Input) for processing conditioning?",
        "answer": "Nodes like `ConditioningCombine` and `KSampler` are commonly used in conjunction with `BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput` for processing conditioning."
