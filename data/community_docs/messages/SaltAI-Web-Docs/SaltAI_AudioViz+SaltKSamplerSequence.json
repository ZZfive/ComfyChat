    {
        "question": "How does the `latent_image` input influence the sequence generation process in the SaltKSamplerSequence node?",
        "answer": "The `latent_image` input in the SaltKSamplerSequence node is used as the initial latent image to be employed as a starting point for the sequence generation, setting the baseline for subsequent modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the effects of the `latent_interpolation_mode` input in the SaltKSamplerSequence node?",
        "answer": "The `latent_interpolation_mode` input in the SaltKSamplerSequence node determines the mathematical approach to blending sequence elements, impacting the smoothness and transition between sequence elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the SaltKSamplerSequence node, what does the `inject_noise` input parameter control?",
        "answer": "The `inject_noise` input in the SaltKSamplerSequence node is a boolean indicating whether noise should be injected into the sequence, introducing variability and potentially enhancing creativity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output of the SaltKSamplerSequence node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltKSamplerSequence node is encapsulated in `latent` output, which represents the final latent representation resulting from the sequence generation and manipulation process, encapsulating the cumulative effects of all applied conditions and modifications."
