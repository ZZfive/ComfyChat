        "question": "What is the purpose of the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node is designed for preparing image settings specifically tailored for pose estimation in the context of Instant ID generation. It optimizes images for subsequent pose analysis by processing parameters such as resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Pipes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the `imageprepare_settings` input in the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the `imageprepare_settings` input in the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node is `BASIC_PIPE` in Comfy and `Tuple[str]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output of the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node indicates the target size for resizing an image?",
        "answer": "The `resize_to` output of the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node indicates the target size to which the image should be resized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for `padding_bottom` in the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node's outputs?",
        "answer": "The data type for `padding_bottom` in the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node's outputs is `INT` in Comfy and `int` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output of the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node specifies the interpolation method for resizing?",
        "answer": "The `interpolation` output of the InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node specifies the interpolation method used for resizing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes in ComfyUI are utilized for preparing images for Instant ID generation?",
        "answer": "The InstantIDPosePrepare_Pipe node is utilized for preparing images for Instant ID generation by optimizing the image for subsequent pose analysis through resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation."
