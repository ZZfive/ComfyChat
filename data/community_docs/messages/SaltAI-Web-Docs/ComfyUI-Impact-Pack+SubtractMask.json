        "question": "What is the SubtractMask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node in ComfyUI is designed to perform subtraction operations between two mask inputs, resulting in a single mask output that represents the difference between the two input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the SubtractMask node?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node requires two input types: mask1 and mask2, both of dtype MASK represented by torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in SubtractMask node serves as the base mask?",
        "answer": "In the SubtractMask node, the first mask input, mask1, serves as the base mask from which the second mask, mask2, will be subtracted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the SubtractMask node produce?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node produces a single output of dtype MASK, represented by a torch.Tensor in Python, which is the resulting mask after subtracting the second mask from the first."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the resulting mask of SubtractMask represent?",
        "answer": "The resulting mask produced by the SubtractMask node represents the differences or changes between the two input masks, effectively highlighting disparities or alterations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operation can highlight disparities between two masks in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node in ComfyUI highlights disparities between two masks by subtracting the second mask from the first, producing a resulting mask that represents the differences between the two."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SubtractMask node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SubtractMask node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Operation' category in ComfyUI."
