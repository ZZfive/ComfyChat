        "question": "What is ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions is a node in ComfyUI designed for generating looped uniform context options specifically for AnimateDiff processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions facilitate?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions facilitates the creation of context configurations that enable seamless looping and uniform distribution of context frames for animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions include context_length (INT), context_stride (INT), context_overlap (INT), and closed_loop (BOOLEAN)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does context_stride influence the animation?",
        "answer": "context_stride defines the step size between each context frame in the looped uniform context, impacting how densely frames are sampled and influencing animation smoothness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the fuse_method parameter specify?",
        "answer": "fuse_method specifies the method used to fuse multiple context frames together, affecting the blending and transition between frames in the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does start_percent indicate?",
        "answer": "start_percent indicates the starting point of the animation as a percentage of the total length, allowing precise control over the initial frame of the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for context_overlap?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for context_overlap is int."
