        "question": "What is CR Cycle Text and where does it belong in the ComfyUI node categories?",
        "answer": "CR Cycle Text is a custom node in ComfyUI that belongs to the 'Comfyroll Studio/Animation/Legacy' category. It is designed to cycle through a list of text strings for animation or display purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Cycle Text node require to operate?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Text node requires the cycling mode (such as 'Sequential'), a list of text strings, the frame interval, the number of loops, and the current frame number to operate."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' input of the CR Cycle Text node work?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input of the CR Cycle Text node specifies the cycling mode. Currently, the 'Sequential' mode is available, which determines how the text strings are selected and cycled through during execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used to cycle through a list of text strings in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Text node in ComfyUI can be used to cycle through a list of text strings for animation or display purposes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'text_list' input represent in the CR Cycle Text node?",
        "answer": "The 'text_list' input in the CR Cycle Text node is a list of text strings to be cycled through, forming the basis of the cycling operation with each string potentially being displayed or used in sequence according to the specified mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'frame_interval' input influence the CR Cycle Text node?",
        "answer": "The 'frame_interval' input in the CR Cycle Text node influences the pace at which text strings are cycled through by specifying the interval between frames used to calculate the current text string to display based on the current frame."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the CR Cycle Text node?",
        "answer": "The CR Cycle Text node provides output types 'STRING' for the currently selected text string based on the cycling parameters and 'show_help', which is a URL to a help page providing additional information on using the CR Cycle Text node."
