        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemoveBackendData node in the Inspire Pack?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendData node in the Inspire Pack is designed to selectively clear data from a backend cache, enabling efficient data updates and deletions by removing specific entries based on a provided key or by clearing the entire cache."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the '*' key represent in the RemoveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "Using '*' as the key in the RemoveBackendData node clears all data from the cache, allowing for bulk deletion or reset operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for the 'key' input parameter in the RemoveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for the 'key' input parameter in the RemoveBackendData node is `STRING` in Comfy and `str` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the RemoveBackendData node handle the 'signal_opt' parameter?",
        "answer": "The 'signal_opt' parameter is returned as is by the RemoveBackendData node, allowing it to be used in subsequent operations or logic flows, facilitating the chaining of operations or the passing of control signals without affecting the cache operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype for the 'signal_opt' input parameter in the RemoveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The dtype for the 'signal_opt' input parameter in the RemoveBackendData node is `*` in Comfy, indicating any data type, and `Any` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'signal' output represent in the RemoveBackendData node?",
        "answer": "The 'signal' output in the RemoveBackendData node represents the optional signal parameter passed to the node, which is returned for use in subsequent operations or logic flows without affecting the cache operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of functionality does the RemoveBackendData node support in backend processes?",
        "answer": "The RemoveBackendData node supports dynamic data management within backend processes by allowing the removal of specific entries based on a provided key or the clearance of the entire cache, enabling efficient data updates and deletions."
