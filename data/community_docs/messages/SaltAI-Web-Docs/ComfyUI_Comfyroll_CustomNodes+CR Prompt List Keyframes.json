        "question": "What is the CR Prompt List Keyframes node primarily used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Prompt List Keyframes node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a list of keyframes based on a given list of prompts, each associated with specific animation parameters such as transition type, speed, and profile. It facilitates the creation of detailed animation sequences by converting textual prompts into structured keyframe data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific type of input data does the 'prompt_list' parameter of the CR Prompt List Keyframes node require?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt_list' parameter requires a list of tuples, each containing a prompt and its associated animation parameters. This list is essential for generating the keyframe list and dictates the content and timing of each keyframe in the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Prompt List Keyframes node handle the generation of keyframes when multiple prompts are provided?",
        "answer": "For each prompt in the 'prompt_list', the CR Prompt List Keyframes node generates a keyframe at the specified interval, with the frame number and prompt string formatted as key-value pairs, such as \"{ 'frame_number': 'prompt_string' }\", helping to structure the animation sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CR Prompt List Keyframes node provide, and in what format?",
        "answer": "The CR Prompt List Keyframes node outputs a generated list of keyframes in string format, ready for use in animation sequences, and it also provides a 'show_help' URL which offers additional information and guidance on using the node effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'keyframe_format' parameter in the CR Prompt List Keyframes node?",
        "answer": "The 'keyframe_format' parameter specifies the format in which the keyframes are generated, influencing the structure and compatibility of the output with different animation tools. In the source code example, only 'Deforum' format is shown."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node would you use to convert a list of textual prompts into structured keyframe data for animations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You would use the CR Prompt List Keyframes node to convert a list of textual prompts into structured keyframe data for animations in ComfyUI, especially when detailed animation sequences with specific transitions are required."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can you find additional information about using the CR Prompt List Keyframes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Additional information about using the CR Prompt List Keyframes node in ComfyUI can be found at the 'show_help' URL provided by the node, which is 'https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/Prompt-Nodes#cr-prompt-list-keyframes'."
