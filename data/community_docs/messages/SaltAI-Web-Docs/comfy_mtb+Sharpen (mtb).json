        "question": "What does the Sharpen (mtb) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Sharpen (mtb) node in ComfyUI enhances the visual clarity of images by applying a sharpening effect, utilizing a Gaussian kernel to accentuate edges and details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Sharpen node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Sharpen node in ComfyUI is `Sharpen (mtb)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Under which category does the Sharpen (mtb) node fall in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The Sharpen (mtb) node falls under the category `mtb/image processing` in ComfyUI's node list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Sharpen (mtb) node in ComfyUI output directly connect to other nodes?",
        "answer": "No, the Sharpen (mtb) node in ComfyUI is not an output node, meaning its output cannot directly connect to other nodes as an output source."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters can control the sharpening effect of an image in the Sharpen (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The parameters `sharpen_radius`, `sigma_x`, `sigma_y`, and `alpha` in the Sharpen (mtb) node can control the sharpening effect of an image, influencing the radius, the spread of the effect, and the intensity respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `sharpen_radius` parameter in the Sharpen (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `sharpen_radius` parameter in the Sharpen (mtb) node defines the radius of the sharpening effect, with a larger radius increasing the area of influence around edges and contributing to a more pronounced sharpening effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can process images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Nodes under the `mtb/image processing` category, such as the Sharpen (mtb) node, can process images in ComfyUI by enhancing their clarity or applying visual effects."
