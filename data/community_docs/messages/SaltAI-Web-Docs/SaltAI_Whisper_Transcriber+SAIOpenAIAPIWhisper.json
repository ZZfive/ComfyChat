        "question": "What is the class name for the node that provides transcription and translation functionality using OpenAI's Whisper API in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the node is `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which required input is crucial for locating and processing the audio content for transcription or translation in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node?",
        "answer": "The required input `file_path` is crucial for locating and processing the audio content in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of specifying the `model` parameter in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node?",
        "answer": "Specifying the `model` parameter in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node is for selecting the appropriate Whisper model to be used for transcription or translation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the `INFRA_TYPE` and `COMMON_NODES` represent in the documentation of the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `INFRA_TYPE` represents the type of processing unit required ('CPU' for this node), and the `COMMON_NODES` indicates any common dependencies; however, for the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node, the `COMMON_NODES` value is unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what ways can the transcription or translation process be customized using the parameters of the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node?",
        "answer": "The transcription or translation process can be customized using the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node parameters by adjusting model selection, response formatting, temperature settings, language, response format, and timestamp granularities."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node allow for controlling the scope and detail of the transcription or translation?",
        "answer": "Parameters that control the scope and detail of the transcription or translation in the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node include `max_frames` for the number of frames and `seek_seconds` for the start point in the audio file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node, and what do these outputs represent?",
        "answer": "The `SAIOpenAIAPIWhisper` node returns `transcription_result`, representing the final text output; `audio_path`, the path to the processed audio file; and `frames_count`, the number of frames processed during transcription or translation."
