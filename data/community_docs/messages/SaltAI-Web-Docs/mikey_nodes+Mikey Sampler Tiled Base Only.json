    {
        "question": "What role does the 'base_model' parameter play in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The 'base_model' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node specifies the underlying model used for generating the tiled samples, defining the foundational architecture and capabilities that the sampling process will utilize."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used in ComfyUI for generating tiled samples based on base conditions?",
        "answer": "The Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node in the 'Mikey/Sampling' category can be used in ComfyUI for generating tiled samples based on base conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'vae' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node represents the variational autoencoder used in conjunction with the base model to refine and adjust the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'model_name' parameter and what values can it take in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The 'model_name' parameter in the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node allows for the selection of a specific model configuration or variant from a predefined list, tailoring the generation process to specific requirements or preferences. It can take values from a predefined list of strings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type associated with the 'image' output of the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node?",
        "answer": "The data type associated with the 'image' output of the Mikey Sampler Tiled Base Only node is 'IMAGE' in Comfy dtype and 'torch.Tensor' in Python dtype."
