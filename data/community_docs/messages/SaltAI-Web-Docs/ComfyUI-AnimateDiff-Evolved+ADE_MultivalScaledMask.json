        "question": "What is the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_MultivalScaledMask node is designed to apply scaling to a given mask based on specified minimum and maximum float values, with the option to choose between absolute or relative scaling methods in the ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node require to specify the lower bound for the mask's value transformation?",
        "answer": "The ADE_MultivalScaledMask node requires the `min_float_val` input, which specifies the minimum value for scaling the mask, setting the lower bound for the mask's value transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used to establish the upper limit for the mask's value transformation in the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node?",
        "answer": "The `max_float_val` input is used to define the maximum value for scaling the mask, thus establishing the upper limit for the mask's value transformation in ADE_MultivalScaledMask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `mask` input in ADE_MultivalScaledMask?",
        "answer": "The `mask` input serves as the target data for scaling operations in the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node, representing the primary subject of the node's functionality, whose values are dynamically adjusted based on the scaling parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node adjust mask values based on the provided scaling parameters?",
        "answer": "The ADE_MultivalScaledMask node adjusts mask values by applying the specified scaling method, either absolute or relative, to the input mask, producing a scaled mask as output after transforming the input mask based on the provided scaling parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node would you use to dynamically adjust mask values based on minimum and maximum float values in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "You would use the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node in ComfyUI to dynamically adjust mask values based on specified minimum and maximum float values with the option to choose between absolute or relative scaling methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `multival` output represent in the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node?",
        "answer": "The `multival` output represents the scaled mask after applying the specified scaling method in the ADE_MultivalScaledMask node, reflecting the transformation of the input mask based on the provided scaling parameters."
