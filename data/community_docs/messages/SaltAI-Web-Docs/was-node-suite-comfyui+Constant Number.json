        "question": "What is the purpose of the Constant Number node in ComfyUI's WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The Constant Number node in ComfyUI's WAS Suite is designed to process numerical inputs and convert them based on specified types, such as integer, float, or boolean. It supports operations like type conversion and value adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'number_type' input in the Constant Number node?",
        "answer": "The 'number_type' input in the Constant Number node specifies the desired type for the output number, allowing for conversion between integer, float, and boolean types. This affects how the input number is processed and converted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Constant Number node handle the 'number_as_text' input?",
        "answer": "The Constant Number node processes the 'number_as_text' input by converting it according to the specified 'number_type' if provided. This allows for textual input to be dynamically interpreted and processed as a numerical value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Constant Number node return for the 'number' output?",
        "answer": "The 'number' output of the Constant Number node returns the processed or converted number in the specified 'number_type'. This demonstrates the node's ability to adjust and convert numerical values effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function 'return_constant_number' in the Constant Number node responsible for?",
        "answer": "The 'return_constant_number' function is responsible for processing the number type, number, and optional number_as_text inputs. It returns the corresponding numerical value in the specified type, including integer, float, and boolean representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Constant Number node handle the conversion of 'number_as_text' when 'number_type' is set to boolean?",
        "answer": "When 'number_type' is set to boolean and 'number_as_text' is provided, the Constant Number node converts 'number_as_text' to a boolean value based on the textual representation of 'True' or 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types associated with the 'number', 'float', and 'int' outputs of the Constant Number node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types associated with the 'number', 'float', and 'int' outputs of the Constant Number node are 'float', 'float', and 'int', respectively. These represent the processed number in the specified numeric type."
