        "question": "What is the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node used for in Animate Diff?",
        "answer": "The `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node is used to create and manage batched context options for Animate Diff operations, allowing customization of context length, start percentage, and guaranteed steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the starting point of the context as a percentage of the total length in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions`?",
        "answer": "The starting point of the context as a percentage of the total length is determined by the `start_percent` input parameter in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are previous context options inherited and modified in Animate Diff?",
        "answer": "Previous context options are inherited and modified using the `prev_context` input parameter in the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `context_length` parameter in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` control?",
        "answer": "The `context_length` parameter in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` controls the length of the context used in batched processing, defining the scope over which animation and diff operations are applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What encapsulates the specified parameters in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` for optimized batch processing?",
        "answer": "The modified or newly created batched context options encapsulate all specified parameters in `ADE_BatchedContextOptions`, ready to be utilized in subsequent Animate Diff operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node, what does the `guarantee_steps` parameter ensure?",
        "answer": "The `guarantee_steps` parameter in the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node ensures a minimum number of steps within the context, maintaining a certain level of detail and smoothness in animation and diffing processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node?",
        "answer": "The output of the `ADE_BatchedContextOptions` node is a `CONTEXT_OPTS`, which is a set of modified or newly created batched context options ready for use in Animate Diff operations."
