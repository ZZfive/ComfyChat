        "question": "What is the purpose of the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Fill (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to extend a batch of floating-point numbers to a specified length by filling it with a given value, either at the beginning or the end of the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required to initialize the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "To initialize the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node, you need a list of floating-point numbers called `floats`, a direction specified by `direction`, a fill value given by `value`, and a target length indicated by `count`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output type of the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node is determined by the resulting batch of floating-point numbers after being filled to the target length, represented as `floats`, with a Comfy dtype as `FLOATS` and a Python dtype as `list[float]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `direction` parameter do in the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `direction` parameter in the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node specifies whether the filling should occur at the beginning ('head') or the end ('tail') of the batch, influencing the order in which the batch is extended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What exception will be raised if the size of the base batch in the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node is greater than the target length?",
        "answer": "A ValueError will be raised if the size of the base batch is greater than the target length, with the message `Size ({size}) is less then target count ({count})`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide an example of a node designed for extending a batch of floating-point numbers?",
        "answer": "An example of a node designed for extending a batch of floating-point numbers is the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node, which extends a given list of floating-point numbers to a specified length by appending or prepending it with a given value based on the direction parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the functionality of the `fill_floats` method in the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `fill_floats` method in the Batch Float Fill (mtb) node fills a batch float with a single value until it reaches the target length by appending or prepending the value to the batch based on the specified direction."
