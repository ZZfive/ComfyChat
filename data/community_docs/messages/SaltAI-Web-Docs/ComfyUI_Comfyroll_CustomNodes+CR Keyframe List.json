        "question": "What is the CR Keyframe List node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Keyframe List node in ComfyUI is designed to process and format a list of keyframes for animation, providing a structured way to define animation sequences and their formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type does the CR Keyframe List node require for defining animation sequences?",
        "answer": "The CR Keyframe List node requires `keyframe_list` as a multiline string representing a list of keyframes to define the sequence of frames in an animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What format does the `keyframe_list` input need to be in for the CR Keyframe List node?",
        "answer": "The `keyframe_list` input for the CR Keyframe List node should be a multiline string where each line specifies a significant point in the animation that will be interpolated between by the animation software."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Keyframe List node handle keyframe format flexibility?",
        "answer": "The CR Keyframe List node allows flexibility in specifying keyframe formats through the `keyframe_format` input, which uses a combo list enabling compatibility with various animation tools and workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Keyframe List node output besides the formatted keyframe list?",
        "answer": "Besides the processed list of keyframes (`keyframe_list`), the CR Keyframe List node also outputs a URL (`show_help`) for further documentation and help on using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of processing does the CR Keyframe List node support?",
        "answer": "The CR Keyframe List node supports CPU processing according to its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes are associated with the CR Keyframe List node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify any common nodes associated specifically with the CR Keyframe List."
