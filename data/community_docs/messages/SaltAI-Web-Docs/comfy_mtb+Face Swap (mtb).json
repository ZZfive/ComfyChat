        "question": "What is the Face Swap (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Face Swap (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used for swapping faces between two images using deep learning models, supporting both single and multiple faces."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Face Swap (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Face Swap (mtb) node belongs to the category `mtb/facetools` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input tensor represent in the Face Swap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input tensor in the Face Swap (mtb) node represents the target image where the face(s) will be swapped into."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for providing the face(s) to be swapped into the target image in the Face Swap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `reference` input tensor in the Face Swap (mtb) node provides the face(s) to be swapped into the target image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `faces_index` input in the Face Swap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `faces_index` input in the Face Swap (mtb) node specifies the indices of the faces in the target image to be swapped, allowing for selective face swapping when multiple faces are present."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which model is used for analyzing faces within the images in the Face Swap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `faceanalysis_model` input in the Face Swap (mtb) node is the model used for analyzing faces within the images, crucial for detecting and preparing faces for the swapping process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output tensor produced by the Face Swap (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output tensor produced by the Face Swap (mtb) node is of data type `IMAGE`, represented by `torch.Tensor` in Python, and it is the resulting image tensor after the face swap operation has been performed."
