        "question": "What is the Transform Image (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Transform Image (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a series of affine transformations to an image, including translation, rotation, scaling (zoom), and shearing, making it suitable for various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for changing the orientation of the image in Transform Image (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'angle' input is responsible for changing the orientation of the image in Transform Image (mtb), rotating the image around its center in degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node should be used if a constant color needs to be filled into new areas of an image after transformation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Transform Image (mtb) node in ComfyUI can be used to fill new areas with a constant color after transformation, utilizing the 'constant_color' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'zoom' input in the Transform Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'zoom' input in the Transform Image (mtb) node is used to enlarge or reduce the image size, impacting the level of detail visible in the transformed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines how the edges of the image are treated during transformation in Transform Image (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'border_handling' input determines how the edges of the image are treated during transformation in Transform Image (mtb), specifying the method used for handling image borders."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of transformation does the Transform Image (mtb) node specialize in?",
        "answer": "The Transform Image (mtb) node specializes in applying affine transformations to images, such as translation, rotation, scaling (zoom), and shearing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way does the 'y' input affect the output image when using Transform Image (mtb)?",
        "answer": "The 'y' input in Transform Image (mtb) affects the output image by shifting it vertically, either up or down, impacting the vertical positioning of the image."
