        "question": "What is the purpose of the Control Net Model Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Control Net Model Input Switch node in ComfyUI is designed to switch between two control net inputs based on a boolean condition, facilitating dynamic control net selection within workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Control Net Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Control Net Model Input Switch node are 'control_net_a', 'control_net_b', and 'boolean'. 'control_net_a' and 'control_net_b' are the two control net options for selection, and 'boolean' is a value determining which control net is selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the boolean input is true in the Control Net Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "When the boolean input is true in the Control Net Model Input Switch node, 'control_net_a' is selected as the output control net."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Control Net Model Input Switch node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Control Net Model Input Switch node falls under the category 'WAS Suite/Logic' in ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Control Net Model Input Switch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Control Net Model Input Switch node in ComfyUI is 'control_net', which is the selected control net based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the selected control net determined in the Control Net Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The selected control net in the Control Net Model Input Switch node is determined based on the boolean condition. If the boolean is true, 'control_net_a' is selected; otherwise, 'control_net_b' is chosen."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name associated with the Control Net Model Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Python class name associated with the Control Net Model Input Switch node is 'WAS_Control_Net_Input_Switch'."
