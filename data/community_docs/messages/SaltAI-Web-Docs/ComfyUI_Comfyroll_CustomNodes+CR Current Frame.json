    {
        "question": "What determines the current frame index in an animation sequence using the CR Current Frame node?",
        "answer": "The current frame index in an animation sequence using the CR Current Frame node is determined by the 'index' input, which specifies the current frame being processed or displayed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the CR Current Frame node help with debugging?",
        "answer": "The CR Current Frame node can help with debugging by utilizing the 'print_to_console' input. If set to 'Yes', it will print the current frame index to the console, providing insights into the animation's progress and aiding in troubleshooting sequencing issues."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Current Frame node return?",
        "answer": "The CR Current Frame node returns the current frame index, denoted as 'index', which is essential for tracking the animation's progress and for further processing of specific frames."
