        "question": "What is ImageScaleDownToSize?",
        "answer": "`ImageScaleDownToSize` is a class in ComfyUI designed for resizing images to a specific size while maintaining their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ImageScaleDownToSize belong to?",
        "answer": "`ImageScaleDownToSize` belongs to the category 'Art Venture/Utils' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageScaleDownToSize node do?",
        "answer": "The `ImageScaleDownToSize` node resizes images to a specified size, scaling them down while preserving their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageScaleDownToSize?",
        "answer": "The required input types for `ImageScaleDownToSize` include `images` of type `IMAGE`, `size` of type `INT`, and `mode` of type `BOOLEAN`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mode' parameter control in ImageScaleDownToSize?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in `ImageScaleDownToSize` determines whether the scaling operation should consider the maximum or minimum dimension of the images, thereby preserving the aspect ratio accordingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageScaleDownToSize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `ImageScaleDownToSize` node is `IMAGE`, which is a tensor of images scaled down to the specified size."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageScaleDownToSize handle the resizing process?",
        "answer": "`ImageScaleDownToSize` calculates the scale factor based on the specified size and either the maximum or minimum dimension of the input images, then scales them down while maintaining their aspect ratio."
