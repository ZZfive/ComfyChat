        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapToOuterCylinder node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapToOuterCylinder node is designed to transform an image by mapping it onto the surface of an imaginary outer cylinder, adjusting the image's perspective to simulate how it would appear wrapped around a cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class is associated with the RemapToOuterCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the RemapToOuterCylinder node is `RemapToOuterCylinder`, which is implemented as a subclass of `RemapBase`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'fov' input represent in the RemapToOuterCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The 'fov' input represents the field of view in degrees, which influences the curvature and perspective of the remapped image in the RemapToOuterCylinder node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the field of view specified in the RemapToOuterCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The field of view in the RemapToOuterCylinder node is specified as an integer value, with default settings at 90 degrees, a minimum of 1 degree, and a maximum of 179 degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'swap_xy' input play in the RemapToOuterCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_xy' input in the RemapToOuterCylinder node is a boolean value that determines whether the x and y coordinates should be swapped, affecting the orientation of the remapped image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'remap' output from the RemapToOuterCylinder node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'remap' output from the RemapToOuterCylinder node provides the mappings for x and y coordinates to the original image pixels, facilitating the transformation of the image onto the outer cylinder's surface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type associated with the 'remap' output of the RemapToOuterCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type associated with the 'remap' output of the RemapToOuterCylinder node is a tuple containing two NumPy ndarrays for the x and y mappings and a NoneType, represented as `Tuple[ndarray, ndarray, NoneType]`."
