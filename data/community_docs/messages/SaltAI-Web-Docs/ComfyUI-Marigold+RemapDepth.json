        "question": "What is the class name of the node that remaps depth values in images?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that remaps depth values in images is `RemapDepth`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the RemapDepth node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapDepth node belongs to the `Marigold` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the RemapDepth node?",
        "answer": "The RemapDepth node is designed to adjust the depth values of an image within a specified range and optionally clamp these values for normalization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of input does the RemapDepth node require?",
        "answer": "The RemapDepth node requires an `image` (Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`), `min` (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`), `max` (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`), and `clamp` (Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`, Python dtype: `bool`) as inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does the clamp parameter serve in the RemapDepth node?",
        "answer": "The `clamp` parameter determines whether the remapped depth values should be clamped within the 0.0 to 1.0 range, ensuring the normalization of depth maps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of the `image` after being processed by the RemapDepth node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the `image` after being processed by the RemapDepth node is `IMAGE` (Comfy dtype) or `torch.Tensor` (Python dtype)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is required for executing the RemapDepth node?",
        "answer": "The RemapDepth node requires an `infra_type` of `GPU` for execution."
