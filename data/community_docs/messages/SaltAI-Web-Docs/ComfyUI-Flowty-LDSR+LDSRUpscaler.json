        "question": "Which category does the LDSRUpscaler node fall under?",
        "answer": "The LDSRUpscaler node falls under the category `Flowty LDSR`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model` input do in the LDSRUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The `model` input in the LDSRUpscaler node specifies the LDSR model to be used for upscaling, determining the upscaling technique and quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LDSRUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LDSRUpscaler node are `model`, `images`, `steps`, and optional inputs include `pre_downscale`, `post_downscale`, and `downsample_method`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `steps` input in the LDSRUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The `steps` input in the LDSRUpscaler node defines the number of steps for the upscaling process, affecting the quality and computation time of the upscaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` output represent in the LDSRUpscaler node?",
        "answer": "The `images` output in the LDSRUpscaler node represents the upscaled images, enhanced in resolution through the LDSR upscaling process."
