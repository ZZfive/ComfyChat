        "question": "What does the PromptScheduleNodeFlow class in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The PromptScheduleNodeFlow class is designed to dynamically construct and manipulate JSON strings based on input text and numerical parameters, facilitating the scheduling of content in a structured format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node are `text` (STRING) and `num_frames` (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `text` input in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node?",
        "answer": "The `text` input in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node serves as the primary text that will be included in the constructed JSON string, acting as the main content or subject of the scheduling operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `num_frames` parameter influence the scheduling operation in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node?",
        "answer": "The `num_frames` parameter in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node specifies the starting point for the scheduling operation, affecting the key under which the new content will be placed in the JSON structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node are `in_text` (STRING) and `max_frames` (INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `in_text` input in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node?",
        "answer": "The `in_text` input in the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node is an optional initial JSON string to which the new content will be appended, allowing for incremental construction of complex JSON structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the PromptScheduleNodeFlow node is an `int` representing the new maximum frame count, derived from the input 'num_frames' and 'max_frames', and a `string` containing the newly constructed JSON string with scheduled content."
