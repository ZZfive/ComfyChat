        "question": "What is the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI is used for enhancing the contrast of an image by applying histogram equalization, which redistributes the image's intensity levels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The EqualizeHistogram node is categorized under 'Bmad/CV/Thresholding' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI is 'EqualizeHistogram'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source image used for in the EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The source image, specified as 'src', is the input to the EqualizeHistogram node, which is processed to enhance its contrast through histogram equalization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'src' input expect in the EqualizeHistogram node?",
        "answer": "The 'src' input in the EqualizeHistogram node expects data of type 'IMAGE', which is represented as 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the EqualizeHistogram node is an 'IMAGE' dtype, represented as 'torch.Tensor' in Python, which is the processed image with enhanced contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI optimized for GPU or CPU processing?",
        "answer": "The EqualizeHistogram node in ComfyUI is optimized for GPU processing."
