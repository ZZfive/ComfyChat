        "question": "In which category does the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node falls under the category `SALT/Scheduling` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are most commonly related to the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The most commonly related nodes to the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node in ComfyUI are unspecified, as indicated by 'common nodes: unknown'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `keyframe_schedule` input define in the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node?",
        "answer": "The `keyframe_schedule` input in the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node defines the sequence of keyframes to be scheduled, forming the basis of the animation or effect timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node utilize the `easing_mode` input?",
        "answer": "The `SaltKeyframeScheduler` node utilizes the `easing_mode` input to specify the easing function to apply to the keyframe schedule, affecting the interpolation and transition between keyframes."
    },
