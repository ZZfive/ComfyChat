        "question": "What is the IterativeLatentUpscale node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IterativeLatentUpscale node is designed to progressively upscale latent images through a series of steps, either geometrically or linearly, to achieve a desired magnification factor, enhancing the quality and resolution of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The IterativeLatentUpscale node falls under the category of ImpactPack/Upscale in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'samples' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node represents the initial latent samples to be upscaled, serving as the starting point for the iterative upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'step_mode' input play in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'step_mode' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node determines whether the upscaling factor is applied geometrically or linearly across the steps, influencing the progression of image sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the IterativeLatentUpscale node output?",
        "answer": "The IterativeLatentUpscale node outputs the final upscaled latent representation after completing all iterative steps and the VAE model used for encoding and decoding during the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the upscaling process controlled by the 'steps' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node controls the number of iterative steps to perform during the upscaling process, which affects the granularity of the upscaling and the intermediate sizes and quality of the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'upscale_factor' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_factor' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node specifies the target magnification factor by which the latent samples are to be upscaled, determining the final size of the upscaled images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which way can the 'temp_prefix' input be used in the IterativeLatentUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'temp_prefix' input in the IterativeLatentUpscale node provides an optional prefix for temporary file saving during the upscaling process, facilitating intermediate result inspection."
