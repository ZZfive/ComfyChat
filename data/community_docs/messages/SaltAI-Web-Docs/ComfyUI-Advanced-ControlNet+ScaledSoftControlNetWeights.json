        "question": "What is ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftControlNetWeights is a class in ComfyUI that specializes in adjusting the control net weights based on a base multiplier and a flip option."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ScaledSoftControlNetWeights do?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftControlNetWeights dynamically scales the weights to fine-tune the control net's influence on the generation process. It offers mechanisms to enhance or diminish the control net's effect based on the base multiplier and can invert the weights' impact using the flip option."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftControlNetWeights requires a base multiplier, which adjusts the overall strength of the control net weights, and a boolean parameter flip_weights, which determines whether the weights should be inverted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does base_multiplier affect ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "The base multiplier in ScaledSoftControlNetWeights scales the control net weights up or down, thereby adjusting their influence on the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does flip_weights do in ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "flip_weights in ScaledSoftControlNetWeights determines whether the control net weights should be inverted. This can significantly alter the generation's direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftControlNetWeights outputs CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS, which represent the adjusted control net weights, and TK_SHORTCUT, which encapsulates these weights in a timestep keyframe."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the usage tip for ScaledSoftControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "ScaledSoftControlNetWeights is optimized for CPU infrastructure. Common nodes associated with it include ControlNetLoaderAdvanced."
