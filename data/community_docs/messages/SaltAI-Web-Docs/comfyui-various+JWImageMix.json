        "question": "What is the function of the JWImageMix node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageMix node in ComfyUI is designed for blending two images together using specified blend modes and a blend factor, allowing for flexible image manipulation and combination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the blend modes supported by the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The JWImageMix node supports blend modes 'mix' and 'multiply' for combining the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input control in the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the JWImageMix node determines the weight of the second image in the blend, affecting how prominently the second image is mixed with the first."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the 'image_a' and 'image_b' inputs for the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "The 'image_a' and 'image_b' inputs for the JWImageMix node are of type `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operation does the 'multiply' blend mode perform in the JWImageMix node?",
        "answer": "In the JWImageMix node, the 'multiply' blend mode mathematically combines the two images by multiplying their values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'JWImageMix' class registration in the source code?",
        "answer": "The 'JWImageMix' class registration in the source code is for specifying the node's category, supported blend types, input and output types, and defining the execute function for blending the images according to the specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What assertion is made regarding the shapes of 'image_a' and 'image_b' in the JWImageMix node's execute function?",
        "answer": "In the JWImageMix node's execute function, an assertion is made that 'image_a' and 'image_b' must have the same shape."
