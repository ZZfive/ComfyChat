        "question": "What does the Time Seed (JPS) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Time Seed (JPS) node generates a unique seed value based on the current time, allowing for a fixed seed to be specified for reproducibility in processes that require randomization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of using a Time Seed (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Time Seed (JPS) node is used to initialize random number generators with a consistent starting point, crucial for reproducibility in processes that require randomization."
    },
    {
        "question": "When would you use the fixed_seed input in the Time Seed (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "You would use the `fixed_seed` input in the Time Seed (JPS) node if you need reproducibility in your random number generation, as it specifies a fixed seed value to be used instead of generating one based on the current time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the seed value generated when `fixed_seed` is set to 0 in the Time Seed (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "When `fixed_seed` is set to 0 in the Time Seed (JPS) node, the seed value is generated based on the current time, ensuring variability with each execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output `seed` in the Time Seed (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output `seed` in the Time Seed (JPS) node is `INT`, representing the generated seed value used for initializing random number generators."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can utilize the output from the Time Seed (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "Nodes in ComfyUI that require a seed value for random number generation can utilize the output from the Time Seed (JPS) node, ensuring reproducibility or variability in the processes they execute."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `Time_Seed` class in ComfyUI's Time Seed (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `Time_Seed` class in ComfyUIâ€™s Time Seed (JPS) node is responsible for initializing the seed generation process and defining the function `get_seed`, which generates the seed value based on the current time or a fixed seed if provided."
