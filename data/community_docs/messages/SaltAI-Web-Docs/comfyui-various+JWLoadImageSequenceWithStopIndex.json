        "question": "What is the purpose of the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node in ComfyUI is designed to batch load a sequence of images based on a specified start and stop index, with options to include or exclude the stop index and to ignore missing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `path_pattern` input specify in the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node?",
        "answer": "The `path_pattern` input specifies the pattern or path for locating the images to be loaded, using placeholders for indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `stop_index` parameter play in the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node?",
        "answer": "The `stop_index` parameter sets the ending index for the image sequence loading, determining the range of images to include."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `inclusive` parameter determine in the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node?",
        "answer": "The `inclusive` parameter determines whether the stop index is included in the loading sequence, allowing for inclusive or exclusive range selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are missing images handled when `ignore_missing_images` is set to `true` in the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node?",
        "answer": "When `ignore_missing_images` is set to `true` in the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node, missing images within the specified range are ignored, enabling robust handling of incomplete sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node return?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node returns the loaded sequence of images as a tensor, with Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWLoadImageSequenceWithStopIndex node belongs to the `jamesWalker55` category in ComfyUI."
