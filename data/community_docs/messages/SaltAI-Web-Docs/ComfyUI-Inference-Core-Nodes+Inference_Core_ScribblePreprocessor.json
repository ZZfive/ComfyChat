    {
        "question": "Which image preprocessing category does the Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor node belongs to the ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the image that needs scribble lines detected in Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The input image for scribble line detection in Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor should be in the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the resolution parameter required in Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor, and what does it do?",
        "answer": "The resolution parameter in Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor is optional and specifies the resolution to which the input image is scaled before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor and in which format?",
        "answer": "The output type of Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor is an image, with the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`, where scribble lines have been detected and enhanced or isolated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is the Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor in terms of output?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor node is not an output node according to its category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for using the Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using the Inference_Core_ScribblePreprocessor node is CPU or GPU, with an infra type specified as `GPU` for optimal performance."
