        "question": "What is CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation is a class in ComfyUI that performs binary operations between two 2-dimensional vectors, resulting in a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec2' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node of CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output node of CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation is 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation include 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' specifies the binary operation, 'a' is the first 2-dimensional vector, and 'b' is the second 2-dimensional vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype of the 'op' input for CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype of the 'op' input for CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation is 'COMBO[STRING]'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation determine the nature of the scalar result?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation determines the nature of the scalar result based on the binary operation specified in the 'op' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation return?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation returns a scalar result of type 'float' after performing the specified binary operation on the two input vectors."
