        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Central Schedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Central Schedule node serves as a central hub for managing and coordinating multiple animation schedules within a project, allowing for the integration and synchronization of various animation schedules to ensure a cohesive animation flow across different elements or scenes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input types are required by the CR Central Schedule node?",
        "answer": "The CR Central Schedule node requires inputs for three separate schedules (`schedule_1`, `schedule_2`, `schedule_3`), their types (`schedule_type1`, `schedule_type2`, `schedule_type3`), and aliases (`schedule_alias1`, `schedule_alias2`, `schedule_alias3`). These inputs are used to define and categorize the animation schedules for proper processing and integration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of schedules can `schedule_type1`, `schedule_type2`, and `schedule_type3` be set as in the CR Central Schedule node?",
        "answer": "The schedule types can be set as 'Value', 'Text', 'Prompt', 'Prompt Weight', 'Model', 'LoRA', 'ControlNet', 'Style', 'Upscale', 'Camera', or 'Job'. This categorization is used for the appropriate processing and integration of the animation schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `schedule_alias1`, `schedule_alias2`, and `schedule_alias3` in the CR Central Schedule node?",
        "answer": "The aliases are used to provide an alternative name for each animation schedule, facilitating easier reference and management within the node. This simplifies reference and management of the schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the optional input type for the CR Central Schedule node?",
        "answer": "The optional input type for the CR Central Schedule node is `schedule`, which can be used to provide additional scheduling information. This input allows for the inclusion of extra schedule data that can be integrated with the main schedules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the CR Central Schedule node provide?",
        "answer": "The CR Central Schedule node outputs a `SCHEDULE` type, which represents the combined or processed animation schedule resulting from the node's operation. It also outputs `show_text`, which is textual information or feedback about the processed schedule, useful for debugging or further adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `show_text` output in the CR Central Schedule node?",
        "answer": "The `show_text` output provides textual information or feedback about the processed schedule, which can be helpful for debugging purposes or for making further adjustments to the schedule. This information can be used to understand the operation outcome or to troubleshoot any issues that may arise."
