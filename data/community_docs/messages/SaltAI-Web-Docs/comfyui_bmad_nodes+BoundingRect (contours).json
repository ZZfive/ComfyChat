        "question": "What does the BoundingRect node in ComfyUI calculate?",
        "answer": "The BoundingRect node in ComfyUI calculates the bounding rectangle of a contour, determining the smallest rectangle that can completely enclose the contour."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the BoundingRect node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the BoundingRect node is `BoundingRect (contours)`, belonging to the category `Bmad/CV/Contour`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the mandatory input required by the BoundingRect node?",
        "answer": "The BoundingRect node requires a contour as input, which is crucial for calculating the bounding rectangle's spatial extent."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines how the bounding rectangle's dimensions are computed and returned?",
        "answer": "The `return_mode` input determines how the bounding rectangle's dimensions are computed and returned, affecting the calculation mode of the bounding rectangle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BoundingRect node output?",
        "answer": "The BoundingRect node outputs the bounding rectangle of the specified contour as a tuple of four integers representing the x, y, width, and height."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are commonly used in conjunction with the BoundingRect node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes used in conjunction with the BoundingRect node in ComfyUI are unknown as specified in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of computation does the BoundingRect node use?",
        "answer": "The BoundingRect node uses CPU for its computations."
