        "question": "What does the Tonemap node in ComfyUI adjust?",
        "answer": "The Tonemap node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the tonal range of images for display on different devices or to achieve specific visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input color spaces supported by the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The Tonemap node supports input images in either linear or sRGB color spaces."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Tonemap node controls the color space of the input images?",
        "answer": "The parameter that controls the color space of the input images in the Tonemap node is `input_mode`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the color space for the output images in the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The `output_mode` parameter determines the color space for the output images in the Tonemap node, choosing between linear and sRGB."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the intensity of the tonemap effect be adjusted?",
        "answer": "The intensity of the tonemap effect can be adjusted using the `tonemap_scale` parameter, which acts as a scale factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output from the Tonemap node?",
        "answer": "The output from the Tonemap node is of data type `IMAGE` in ComfyUI, which is represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which method is called to apply the tonemap process in the Tonemap node's source code?",
        "answer": "The method called to apply the tonemap process in the Tonemap node's source code is `apply`."
