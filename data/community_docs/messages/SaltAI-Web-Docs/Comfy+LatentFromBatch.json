        "answer": "LatentFromBatch falls under the category `latent/batch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of LatentFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The purpose of LatentFromBatch is to extract a subset of latent samples from a batch, starting from a specified index and for a specified length."

    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for LatentFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentFromBatch include `samples` of type `LATENT`, `batch_index` of type `INT`, and `length` of type `INT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of LatentFromBatch?",
        "answer": "The output type of LatentFromBatch is `LATENT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentFromBatch handle the extraction of samples?",
        "answer": "LatentFromBatch extracts samples by copying the subset from the `samples` parameter based on the `batch_index` and `length` parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does LatentFromBatch return after processing?",
        "answer": "After processing, LatentFromBatch returns the extracted subset of latent samples in a tuple."

    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for LatentFromBatch?",
        "answer": "Some usage tips for LatentFromBatch include using it on CPU infrastructures and considering its compatibility with common nodes like LatentBlend."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentFromBatch manage noise masks?",
        "answer": "LatentFromBatch checks for the presence of `noise_mask` in the input `samples` and processes it accordingly to match the subset of extracted samples."
