        "question": "What is the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` class designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` class is designed to apply a scheduled pitch shift to audio data, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the pitch over time in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node are `audio`, which is the audio data to which the pitch shift will be applied, and `schedule`, which is a list of semitone values specifying the pitch shift amount at different points in the audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `schedule` input in the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node?",
        "answer": "The `schedule` input in the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node is a list of semitone values that specify the pitch shift amount at different points in the audio, defining the dynamic nature of the pitch shift over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node handle the `interpolate` input?",
        "answer": "The `interpolate` input in the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node is a boolean flag that, if set to True, indicates whether to interpolate between the points specified in the schedule, allowing for smoother transitions in pitch shift."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node is `audio`, which is the resulting audio data after applying the scheduled pitch shift, reflecting the dynamic changes in pitch specified by the input schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node process audio when `interpolate` is set to True?",
        "answer": "When `interpolate` is set to True, the `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node processes audio by interpolating between the points specified in the schedule, creating a smoother transition of pitch shift."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI can be used for applying scheduled pitch shifts?",
        "answer": "The `SaltAudioPitchShiftScheduled` node in ComfyUI can be used for applying scheduled pitch shifts to audio data."
