        "question": "What are the six nodes introduced by ComfyUI_Noise?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI_Noise introduces six nodes designed to enhance noise control and flexibility. These nodes are for generating noise, duplicating batch indices, mixing latents, calculating noise expectations for samplers, injecting noise into latents, and reversing the sampling process to deduce the noise that would recreate a given image."
