        "question": "What does the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node in ComfyUI is designed to augment conditioning data with additional parameters related to image dimensions and cropping, enriching the conditioning context for more precise control over the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to add specific image dimensions and cropping parameters to conditioning data in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node can be used to add specific image dimensions and cropping parameters to conditioning data in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node include conditioning data (Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING), width (Comfy dtype: INT), height (Comfy dtype: INT), crop_w (Comfy dtype: INT), crop_h (Comfy dtype: INT), target_width (Comfy dtype: INT), and target_height (Comfy dtype: INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node impact the final dimensions of generated images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node impacts the final dimensions of generated images in ComfyUI by allowing the specification of target_width and target_height, which influence the final dimensions of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node in ComfyUI is conditioning data (Comfy dtype: CONDITIONING) enriched with image dimensions and cropping parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the conditioning input in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node?",
        "answer": "The conditioning input in the BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams node serves as the conditioning data to be augmented with image dimension and cropping parameters, playing a crucial role in defining the context for image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code for BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams, what does the encode method do?",
        "answer": "In the source code for BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams, the encode method takes conditioning data along with width, height, crop_w, crop_h, target_width, and target_height and augments the conditioning data with these image dimension and cropping parameters."
