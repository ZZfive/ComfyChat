        "question": "What is Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream]?",
        "answer": "Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI that applies a time-based offset to a frame counter, adjusting the current frame based on a specified duration in seconds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node do?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node adjusts a frame counter by applying a time-based offset. It converts time into an equivalent frame count increment, ensuring accurate synchronization in animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node calculate the adjusted frame counter?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node multiplies the specified offset duration in seconds by the frame rate of the frame counter to calculate the equivalent frame count adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node requires a frame counter input (Comfy dtype: FRAME_COUNTER, Python dtype: FrameCounter) and an offset_seconds input (Comfy dtype: FLOAT, Python dtype: float)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node is an adjusted frame counter (Comfy dtype: FRAME_COUNTER, Python dtype: FrameCounter), which is incremented by the calculated frame count equivalent of the specified time offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node facilitate animation timing adjustments?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node facilitates animation timing adjustments by converting a specified duration in seconds into an equivalent frame count increment, ensuring that the animation stays synchronized with the frame rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Time Offset [Dream] node belongs to the Animation category in ComfyUI."
