        "question": "What does the SAMDetectorSegmented node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The SAMDetectorSegmented node in ComfyUI is designed for generating segmented masks based on the SAM model, processing an image along with segmentation hints and other parameters to produce a detailed mask that highlights specific areas of interest within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the SAMDetectorSegmented node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the SAMDetectorSegmented node in ComfyUI is `SAMDetectorSegmented`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'sam_model' input in SAMDetectorSegmented?",
        "answer": "The 'sam_model' input in SAMDetectorSegmented is the SAM model used for generating the mask, playing a crucial role in determining the areas of interest within the image based on the provided segmentation hints."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in SAMDetectorSegmented influences the sensitivity of mask generation?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' input in SAMDetectorSegmented determines the sensitivity of mask generation, influencing the areas that will be highlighted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by SAMDetectorSegmented?",
        "answer": "SAMDetectorSegmented provides two types of outputs: 'combined_mask' which is the aggregated result of the segmented mask generation, and 'batch_masks' which offers individual segmented masks for each segment processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in SAMDetectorSegmented is used to adjust the thickness of the mask's edges?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' input parameter in SAMDetectorSegmented adjusts the thickness of the mask's edges, allowing for finer control over the mask's boundary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'detection_hint' input in SAMDetectorSegmented used for?",
        "answer": "The 'detection_hint' input in SAMDetectorSegmented is used to guide the detection process, allowing for more focused and accurate mask generation."
