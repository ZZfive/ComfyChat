        "question": "What does the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node in ComfyUI is designed to progressively sample images using an advanced KSampler algorithm, tailored for the Inspire pack. It allows for detailed adjustments and enhancements at each step of the image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter is used to determine the generative model in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node?",
        "answer": "The model parameter specifies the generative model to be used for sampling in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node, which plays a key role in determining the quality and style of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter controls the number of steps in the sampling process of the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' parameter in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node specifies the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, influencing the refinement and detail of the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'cfg' parameter in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node allow customization of?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' (configuration) parameter allows for the customization of the sampling process in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node, enabling adjustment of the generation according to specific requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'latent_image' parameter in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent_image' parameter in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node is the initial latent image to start the sampling from, setting the baseline for the progressive refinement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node capture and return intermediate samples during the sampling process?",
        "answer": "The KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node can capture and return intermediate samples during the sampling process by specifying the 'interval' parameter, which allows observation of the progression throughout the process at defined intervals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'latent' output represent in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' output in the KSampler Advanced Progress (Inspire) node represents the final latent image after the completion of the sampling process, reflecting the culmination of the progressive refinement applied to the image generation."
