        "question": "What is AddNoise in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "AddNoise is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to introduce controlled noise to latent images during the sampling process of generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `model` input play in the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The `model` input in the AddNoise node provides operations specific to the generative model, crucial for processing latent images and adding noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `noise` input contribute to the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The `noise` input in the AddNoise node generates noise that is added to the latent images, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sigmas` input determine in the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The `sigmas` input in the AddNoise node determines the scale of the noise to be added. It influences the intensity and variation of the noise applied to the latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AddNoise node is `LATENT`, representing the modified latent image after noise has been added."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AddNoise node handle multiple sigma values?",
        "answer": "If the AddNoise node receives multiple sigma values, it calculates the scale based on the absolute difference between the first and last sigma values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some usage tips for the AddNoise node?",
        "answer": "The AddNoise node is optimized for GPU infrastructure. It is commonly used for adding controlled noise to enhance the diversity or realism of generated samples."
