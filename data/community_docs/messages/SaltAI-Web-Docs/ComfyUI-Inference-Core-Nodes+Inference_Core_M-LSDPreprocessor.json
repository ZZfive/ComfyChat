        "question": "What is the M-LSD Preprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The M-LSD Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is used for extracting line segments from images using the M-LSD (Multi-Level Line Segment Detector) model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core M-LSDPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core M-LSDPreprocessor node belongs to the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the M-LSD Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the M-LSD Preprocessor node is the input image, which is to be processed for line segment detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `score_threshold` parameter in M-LSD Preprocessor node control?",
        "answer": "The `score_threshold` parameter in the M-LSD Preprocessor node controls the confidence threshold for line segment detection. Lines with scores below this threshold are discarded."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `dist_threshold` parameter in the M-LSD Preprocessor affect line segment detection?",
        "answer": "The `dist_threshold` parameter in the M-LSD Preprocessor affects line segment detection by setting the distance threshold for separating line segments, influencing the granularity of the detected lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the M-LSD Preprocessor node in terms of ComfyUI dtype?",
        "answer": "The output type of the M-LSD Preprocessor node in terms of ComfyUI dtype is `IMAGE`, which is an image annotated with detected line segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype does the output of the M-LSD Preprocessor node correspond to?",
        "answer": "The output of the M-LSD Preprocessor node corresponds to the Python dtype `numpy.ndarray`, representing an annotated image with detected line segments."
