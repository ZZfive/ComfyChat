        "question": "What does the CR Repeater node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The CR Repeater node in ComfyUI is designed to replicate items within a list or a single item multiple times based on a specified repeat count, facilitating the generation of extended datasets or the amplification of existing data elements for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the CR Repeater node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Repeater node belongs to the 'üß© Comfyroll Studio/‚ú® Essential/üìú List/üõ†Ô∏è Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Repeater node are `input_data`, which can be a single item or a list of items, and `repeats`, which specifies the number of times the input data should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is `input_data` in the context of the CR Repeater node?",
        "answer": "`input_data` in the CR Repeater node represents the data to be repeated. It can be either a single item or a list of items, determining the scope of repetition within the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Repeater node handle data expansion?",
        "answer": "The CR Repeater node handles data expansion through the parameter `repeats`, which directly influences the size of the output list by specifying the number of times the input data should be repeated, thus controlling data expansion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Repeater node output, other than a list?",
        "answer": "Aside from outputting a list containing the repeated instances of the input data, the CR Repeater node also outputs a `show_help` string, providing a URL to the documentation or help page for the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtypes and Comfy dtypes are associated with the CR Repeater node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtypes for input `input_data` are `Union[List[Any], Any]`, and for `repeats` and the output list, it's `List[Any]`. The Comfy dtypes for `input_data` and output `list` are `*` (indicating any type), and for `repeats` and `show_help`, they are 'INT' and 'STRING' respectively."
