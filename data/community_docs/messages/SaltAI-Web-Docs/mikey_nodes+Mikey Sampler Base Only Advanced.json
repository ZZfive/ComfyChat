        "question": "What does the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node focus on in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node in ComfyUI focuses on providing a base-only approach to sampling tasks, offering enhanced control and flexibility in generating samples without the complexity of additional layers or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `base_model` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `base_model` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node specifies the base model used for sampling, serving as the foundation for generating new samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node handle sampling with positive and negative conditioning?",
        "answer": "The MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node guides the sampling process toward desired attributes or content using positive conditioning (`positive_cond_base`), and avoids certain attributes or content using negative conditioning (`negative_cond_base`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `samples` input represent in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `samples` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node represents the initial set of samples or latent space from which the sampling process begins."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type determines whether noise should be added to the sampling process in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `add_noise` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node determines whether noise should be added to the sampling process, potentially enhancing the diversity or realism in the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way does the `steps` input affect the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node's sampling process?",
        "answer": "The `steps` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node specifies the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, directly impacting the detail and quality of the generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `smooth_step` input influence the sampling process in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "The `smooth_step` input in the MikeySamplerBaseOnlyAdvanced node adjusts the smoothness of the sampling steps, potentially improving the transition or variation between generated samples."
