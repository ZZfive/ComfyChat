        "question": "What is the XYAny node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The XYAny node in ComfyUI is designed to generate combinations of X and Y values, optionally incorporating a third dimension, Z, to extend these combinations. It facilitates the creation and labeling of these combinations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What labels are provided by default for X and Y values if custom labels are not given in the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The XYAny node provides fallback labels for X and Y values if custom labels are not given. These fallback labels are used to ensure each X and Y value has an associated label."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the XYAny node output when Z values are provided?",
        "answer": "When Z values are provided, the XYAny node outputs combined Z values along with their associated labels."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are custom X, Y, and Z labels handled in the XYAny node when provided?",
        "answer": "Custom X, Y, and Z labels in the XYAny node override the fallback labels if provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Split Every output in the XYAny node?",
        "answer": "The Split Every output in the XYAny node specifies the interval at which the combinations are split, based on the length of the Y values."

    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI allows for the generation of combinations of data points for visualization?",
        "answer": "The XYAny node in ComfyUI allows for the generation of combinations of data points for visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data can the X, Y, and Z inputs of the XYAny node handle?",
        "answer": "The X, Y, and Z inputs of the XYAny node can handle a list of any data type."
