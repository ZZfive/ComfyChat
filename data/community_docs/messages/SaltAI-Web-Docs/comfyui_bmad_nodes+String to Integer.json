        "question": "What is the purpose of the String to Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The String to Integer node in ComfyUI is designed to convert string representations of integers into their integer form, which is useful for processing or calculating numerical values, especially when they are received as strings from JSON inputs."

    {
        "question": "What is the output node of String to Integer in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node of the String to Integer in ComfyUI is 'False', indicating that it is not an output node but rather a conversion node."

        "question": "Which class is responsible for the functionality of the String to Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The functionality of the String to Integer node in ComfyUI is handled by the 'String2Int' class."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'String2Int' class handle integer values from JSON inputs?",
        "answer": "The 'String2Int' class in ComfyUI is designed to handle both integer and string types. It assumes that it may receive values from the RequestInputs node and will still work with integer values in the JSON inputs due to the int() cast, which works for both integer and string types alike."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'FUNCTION' attribute specify in the 'String2Int' class?",
        "answer": "The 'FUNCTION' attribute in the 'String2Int' class specifies the name of the function that performs the conversion from string to integer, which is 'convert' in this context."
