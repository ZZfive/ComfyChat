        "question": "What is the FloatToMask node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The FloatToMask node in ComfyUI is designed to generate masks based on input floating-point values, where each value determines the intensity or transparency of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FloatToMask node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FloatToMask node belongs to the KJNodes category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the FloatToMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the FloatToMask node are `input_values` (List[float] or float), `width` (int), and `height` (int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `input_values` input represent in the FloatToMask node?",
        "answer": "The `input_values` input represents the floating-point values used to generate the masks. Each value in this list determines the intensity of the corresponding mask in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the `input_values` input in the FloatToMask node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the `input_values` input is `FLOAT`, and the Python dtype is `List[float] or float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dimensions determine the size of the masks generated by the FloatToMask node?",
        "answer": "The dimensions `width` and `height` determine the size of the masks generated by the FloatToMask node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the FloatToMask node and what is its Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "The output of the FloatToMask node is a batch of masks with the specified width and height dimensions, and its Comfy dtype is `MASK`."
