        "question": "What is the BinaryPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for preprocessing images by applying a binary thresholding technique, converting images into binary images (black and white) based on a specified threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'image' parameter represent in the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter is the input image to be processed by the BinaryPreprocessor node. It is the primary data on which the binary thresholding operation is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BinaryPreprocessor node determine the black and white conversion of pixels in the input image?",
        "answer": "The BinaryPreprocessor node uses the 'bin_threshold' parameter, which specifies the cutoff value for pixel values in the image to either black or white conversion. Pixels with values above this threshold are turned white, and those below are turned black."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'resolution' parameter in the BinaryPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the BinaryPreprocessor node specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before applying the binary thresholding. This ensures consistent processing across images of varying original resolutions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the BinaryPreprocessor node is a binary (black and white) version of the input image, where the conversion is based on the specified bin_threshold value. The output is of type IMAGE in Comfy dtype and numpy.ndarray in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the BinaryPreprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BinaryPreprocessor node belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class name for the BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Python class name for the BinaryPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is 'Binary_Preprocessor'."
