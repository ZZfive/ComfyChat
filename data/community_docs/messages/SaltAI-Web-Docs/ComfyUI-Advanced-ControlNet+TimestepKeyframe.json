        "question": "What is TimestepKeyframe?",
        "answer": "TimestepKeyframe is a class in ComfyUI that encapsulates the concept of a keyframe within a timeline, specifying the start percentage, strength, and optional control weights, latent keyframes, and mask hints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TimestepKeyframe node allow you to control?",
        "answer": "The TimestepKeyframe node allows precise control over the animation or transformation process by specifying the start percentage, strength, optional control weights, latent keyframes, and mask hints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the TimestepKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the TimestepKeyframe node include start_percent, which specifies the starting point of the keyframe as a percentage of the total timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TimestepKeyframe node handle optional control weights?",
        "answer": "The TimestepKeyframe node handles optional control weights with the cn_weights parameter, which can be applied to modulate effects or transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the inherit_missing flag in the TimestepKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "The inherit_missing flag in the TimestepKeyframe node indicates whether missing attributes should be inherited from previous keyframes, ensuring continuity in the animation or transformation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TimestepKeyframe node return as output?",
        "answer": "The TimestepKeyframe node returns a modified or new timestep keyframe, incorporating the specified parameters and potentially adding it to a sequence of keyframes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you chain or sequence keyframes over time with the TimestepKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "You can chain or sequence keyframes over time with the TimestepKeyframe node by referencing a previous timestep keyframe using the prev_timestep_kf parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some optional components of the TimestepKeyframe node?",
        "answer": "Some optional components of the TimestepKeyframe node include strength, latent keyframes, null_latent_kf_strength, guarantee_usage, and mask_optional."
