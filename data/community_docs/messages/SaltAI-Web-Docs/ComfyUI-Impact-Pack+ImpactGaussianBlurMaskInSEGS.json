        "question": "What does the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node applies a Gaussian blur to the masks within a collection of segmentation elements (SEGS), potentially enhancing the visual quality or aiding in the processing of these elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node specifies the size of the Gaussian kernel used for blurring?",
        "answer": "The parameter that specifies the size of the Gaussian kernel used for blurring in the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node is `kernel_size`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the spread of the blur effect be controlled in ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS?",
        "answer": "The spread of the blur effect in ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS can be controlled by adjusting the `sigma` parameter, which influences the softness and diffuseness of the blur."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node is the modified collection of segmentation elements (SEGS) with the masks blurred using the specified Gaussian parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which programming language is the source code for ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS written?",
        "answer": "The source code for ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS is written in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The category of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node in ComfyUI's node list is `ImpactPack/Util`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of impact does the Gaussian blur effect of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node have on the masks of the SEG collection?",
        "answer": "The Gaussian blur effect of the ImpactGaussianBlurMaskInSEGS node has the impact of potentially enhancing the visual quality or aiding in the processing of segmentation masks within a collection of segmentation elements (SEGS), allowing for fine-tuned control over the appearance of the segmentation masks."
