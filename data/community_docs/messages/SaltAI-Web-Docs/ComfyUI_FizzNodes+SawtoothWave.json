    {
        "question": "What determines the period of the sawtooth wave in the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The period of the sawtooth wave in the SawtoothWave node is determined by the `phase` input, which affects the repetition rate of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the starting value of the sawtooth wave established in the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The starting value of the sawtooth wave in the SawtoothWave node is established by the `start_value` input, setting the initial position of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What adjusts the horizontal positioning of the sawtooth wave in the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The horizontal positioning of the sawtooth wave in the SawtoothWave node is adjusted by the `x_translation` input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What indicates the current point in time for the wave's calculation in the SawtoothWave node?",
        "answer": "The current point in time for the wave's calculation in the SawtoothWave node is indicated by the `current_frame` input, which is crucial for the dynamic progression of the wave."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of outputs does the SawtoothWave node provide?",
        "answer": "The SawtoothWave node provides outputs in the form of a calculated wave value as a floating-point number (`float`) and its integer representation (`int`)."
