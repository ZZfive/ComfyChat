        "question": "What is the 'Float to String' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Float to String' node in ComfyUI, also known as FLOATtoSTRING, is designed to convert floating-point numbers into their string representation, optionally formatting the output with commas for readability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'float_' input represent in the 'Float to String' node?",
        "answer": "The 'float_' input represents the floating-point number to be converted into a string. This parameter is central to the node's operation and determines the numerical value that will be transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'use_commas' flag affect the output of the 'Float to String' node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_commas' flag in the 'Float to String' node indicates whether to format the resulting string with commas for thousands, millions, etc., enhancing readability of the numerical value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used for the input 'float_' and 'use_commas' in the 'Float to String' node?",
        "answer": "The input 'float_' is of type 'FLOAT' in Comfy dtype and 'float' in Python dtype. The 'use_commas' input is of type 'COMBO[STRING]' in Comfy dtype and 'str' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the 'Float to String' node produce?",
        "answer": "The 'Float to String' node produces a single output of type 'string', which is the string representation of the input floating-point number, formatted according to the 'use_commas' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Float to String' node handle the 'use_commas' flag to format the string output?",
        "answer": "If 'use_commas' is set to 'true', the 'Float to String' node formats the output string with commas for thousands, millions, etc. If 'use_commas' is set to 'false', the output string will not include any commas."

    {
        "question": "In which category does the 'Float to String' node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Float to String' node falls under the 'Mikey/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
