        "question": "What is the purpose of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images, extracting scribble lines using the PiDiNet model. It enhances the lines for further processing or visualization, making it suitable for stylized line drawings or sketches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node belongs to the category of ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is mandatory for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The mandatory input for the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is the `image`, which is the input image to be processed for scribble line extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the resolution input affect the output of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The resolution input in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node determines the scale to which the input image is resized before processing. This affects the detail level of the scribble lines extracted from the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the safe input in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The safe input in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node, when enabled, applies additional safety checks or constraints during the processing to ensure robustness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is an image with enhanced scribble lines, represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python and suitable for further processing or visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the scribble line extraction model used in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The scribble line extraction in the Scribble_PiDiNet_Preprocessor node is performed using the PiDiNet model, specifically designed for line extraction and enhancement."
