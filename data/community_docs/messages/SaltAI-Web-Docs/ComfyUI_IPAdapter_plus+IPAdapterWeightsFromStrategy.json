        "question": "What is the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node in ComfyUI is designed to generate weights for image processing based on a specified strategy, allowing for the dynamic adjustment of image processing parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node include `weights`, `weights_invert`, `total_frames`, `image_1`, `image_2`, and `weights_strategy`, catering to various aspects of image manipulation and processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `weights_strategy` input parameter in IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy specify?",
        "answer": "The `weights_strategy` input parameter specifies the strategy to be used for generating weights in the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node, influencing how images are processed and manipulated in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used to generate weights for image processing based on a specific strategy in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node in the `ipadapter/weights` category can be used to generate weights for image processing based on a specified strategy in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the `weights` output from the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the `weights` output from the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node is `FLOAT`, represented as `List[float]` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node modify images?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node modifies images by applying a strategy specified by `weights_strategy`, outputting modified images as `image_1` and `image_2`, each tailored differently based on the weights and strategy applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `total_frames` in the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node?",
        "answer": "The `total_frames` output from the IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node represents the total number of frames calculated based on the weights strategy, affecting the duration of the image processing in ComfyUI."
