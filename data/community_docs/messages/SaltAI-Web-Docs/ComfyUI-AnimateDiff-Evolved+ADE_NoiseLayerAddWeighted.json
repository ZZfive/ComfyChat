        "question": "What is the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node in ComfyUI is used to enhance the noise layering process by applying a weighted addition of noise to an existing noise layer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node belongs to the 'Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/noise layers' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'balance_multiplier' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node?",
        "answer": "The 'balance_multiplier' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node adjusts the balance between the old and new noise, fine-tuning the overall effect of noise addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input in ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted allows for overriding the seed value for noise generation?",
        "answer": "The 'seed_override' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node provides an option to override the seed value used for noise generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node utilize the 'mask_optional' input?",
        "answer": "The 'mask_optional' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node is used to selectively influence the noise addition process, providing further control over the noise characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'noise_weight' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_weight' input in the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node controls the weight of the new noise being added, allowing for adjustment of the noise's influence on the existing layer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node provide?",
        "answer": "The ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node outputs the 'noise_layers', which is the updated noise layer group after the addition of the weighted noise layer, reflecting the new state of noise layering."
