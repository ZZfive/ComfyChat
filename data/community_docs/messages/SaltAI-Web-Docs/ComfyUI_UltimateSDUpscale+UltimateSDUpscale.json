        "question": "What is the UltimateSDUpscale node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The UltimateSDUpscale node is used for integrating advanced upscaling techniques to enhance image resolution and quality within the ComfyUI framework, leveraging the Ultimate SD Upscale by Coyote-A."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which deep learning model is required by the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The UltimateSDUpscale node requires a deep learning model for processing the image, which is crucial for the upscaling and enhancement process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'positive' input type play in the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'positive' input type, with a Comfy dtype of CONDITIONING and Python dtype of str, provides positive conditioning text to guide the image processing, enhancing specific attributes or elements within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type determines the factor by which the image will be upscaled in the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_by' input, with a Comfy dtype of FLOAT and Python dtype of float, determines the factor by which the image will be upscaled, influencing the size and detail level of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the seed input type in the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The seed input type, with a Comfy dtype of INT and Python dtype of int, provides a seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in the UltimateSDUpscale node controls the method of seam fixing?",
        "answer": "The 'seam_fix_mode' input type, with a Combo string output node, controls the seam fixing strategy to be applied after upscaling, aiming to improve the visual coherence of the upscaled image by addressing potential artifacts at tile boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the tile_width input type control in the UltimateSDUpscale node?",
        "answer": "The 'tile_width' input type, with a Comfy dtype of INT and Python dtype of int, controls the width of the tiles used in the upscaling process, affecting the granularity and detail of the upscaled image."
