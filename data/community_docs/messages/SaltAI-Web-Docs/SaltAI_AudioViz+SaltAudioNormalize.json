        "question": "What is the SaltAudioNormalize node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltAudioNormalize is a node in ComfyUI designed to adjust the audio level of a given audio file to a standard level to ensure consistent volume across different audio tracks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'audio' input parameter in the SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The 'audio' input parameter is the raw audio data that needs normalization. It is crucial for determining the audio's current volume level and adjusting it to the target normalization level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types for the SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node outputs 'audio', which is the normalized audio data with adjusted volume levels for consistency across different tracks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the SaltAudioNormalize class in the source code?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize class has a function 'normalize_audio' that takes in the 'audio' parameter, converts the audio to an audio segment, normalizes the audio segment, and returns the normalized audio."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltAudioNormalize node classified?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node is classified under the category 'SALT/Audio/Process'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the normalized audio represented in the Python data type?",
        "answer": "The normalized audio is represented as 'bytes' in the Python data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default infrastructure type used by the SaltAudioNormalize node?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioNormalize node uses 'CPU' as the infrastructure type."
