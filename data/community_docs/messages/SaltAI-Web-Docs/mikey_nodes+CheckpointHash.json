        "question": "What is the purpose of the CheckpointHash node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointHash node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a hash value for a given checkpoint file, crucial for verifying its integrity and ensuring it has not been altered or corrupted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CheckpointHash node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointHash node belongs to the 'Mikey/Loaders' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CheckpointHash node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CheckpointHash node is `ckpt_hash`, the generated hash value of the specified checkpoint file, which serves as a unique identifier and integrity verifier for the file."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter is required for the CheckpointHash node to generate a hash for a specific checkpoint file?",
        "answer": "The required parameter for the CheckpointHash node to generate a hash is `ckpt_name`, specifying the name of the checkpoint file for which the hash is to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `ckpt_name` parameter use in the CheckpointHash node, and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The `ckpt_name` parameter in the CheckpointHash node uses the 'STRING' data type in Comfy, representing the name of the checkpoint file for which the hash is to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CheckpointHash node require to ensure the reliability and consistency of model loading processes?",
        "answer": "To ensure the reliability and consistency of model loading processes, the CheckpointHash node requires the input of a valid checkpoint file name to generate a hash for, thus verifying the file's integrity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of processing does the CheckpointHash node support according to its documentation?",
        "answer": "The CheckpointHash node, according to the documentation, supports CPU processing as part of its infrastructure."
