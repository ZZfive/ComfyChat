        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node is designed to apply a scheduled displacement to a batch of images based on provided amplitude and angle schedules, using an optimized displacement layer for image transformation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the necessary input to define the base content that will undergo displacement in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node?",
        "answer": "The required input is the `images` batch, which is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo displacement in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in SaltScheduledImageDisplacement guides the displacement process by determining the direction and magnitude?",
        "answer": "The `displacement_images` input is used to determine the displacement direction and magnitude for each image in the batch in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What controls the intensity of the displacement effect in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node if provided?",
        "answer": "The `amplitude_schedule` input, if provided, specifies the intensity or amplitude of the displacement effect for each image in the batch in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the direction of the displacement effect controlled in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node?",
        "answer": "The direction of the displacement effect is controlled through the `angle_schedule` input parameter in the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is used for dynamic image manipulation based on predefined schedules in ComfyUI's Salt category?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node is used for dynamic image manipulation over a sequence, adapting the displacement effect according to predefined schedules in ComfyUI's Salt category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node and its format?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltScheduledImageDisplacement node is a batch of images after applying the scheduled displacement, and it is returned in the format of `torch.Tensor`."
