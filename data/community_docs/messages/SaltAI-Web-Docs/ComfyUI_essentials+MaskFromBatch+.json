        "question": "What is the purpose of the MaskFromBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromBatch node is designed to extract a specific segment from a given mask based on a starting point and a length, enabling precise control over the portion of the mask to be utilized."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node allows you to focus on specific portions of a mask for manipulation or analysis?",
        "answer": "The MaskFromBatch+ node allows for focused manipulation or analysis of specific parts of the mask by extracting a segment based on start index and length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the MaskFromBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the MaskFromBatch+ node are `mask` (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor), `start` (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int), and `length` (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter represent in the MaskFromBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter represents the input mask from which a segment will be extracted in the MaskFromBatch+ node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the segment of the mask determined in the MaskFromBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The segment of the mask in the MaskFromBatch+ node is determined by the 'start' and 'length' parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the 'length' parameter in the MaskFromBatch+ node is set to a negative value?",
        "answer": "When the 'length' parameter in the MaskFromBatch+ node is set to a negative value, it uses the entire length from the 'start' index to the end of the mask."
