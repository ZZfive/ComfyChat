        "question": "What is the HyperTileInspire node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The HyperTileInspire node is designed to enhance the functionality of models by applying a specialized tiling mechanism, rearranging the output of models to optimize for specific tasks, such as image generation or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the HyperTileInspire node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HyperTileInspire node belongs to the 'InspirePack/__for_testing' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the HyperTileInspire node require to modify models?",
        "answer": "The HyperTileInspire node requires a model to be modified with the HyperTile mechanism, which serves as the foundation for the tiling process. The model's data type in Comfy is 'MODEL' and in Python is 'torch.nn.Module'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the tile size input of the HyperTileInspire node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The tile size input determines the size of the tiles used in the tiling process, which directly influences the granularity of the output. It is an integer input with a Comfy dtype of 'INT' and a Python dtype of 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the max_depth input in the HyperTileInspire node?",
        "answer": "The max_depth input of the HyperTileInspire node defines the maximum depth for applying the tiling mechanism, impacting the complexity and detail of the tiled output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the scale_depth input control in the HyperTileInspire node?",
        "answer": "The scale_depth input is a boolean flag that determines whether the depth scaling is applied in the HyperTileInspire node, thus influencing the variation in detail across different depths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the HyperTileInspire node output and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The HyperTileInspire node outputs a modified version of the input model with adjusted attention mechanism patches. The output data type in Comfy is 'MODEL', and in Python, it is 'torch.nn.Module'."
