        "question": "What is the 'Number Operation' node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The 'Number Operation' node in ComfyUI performs various mathematical operations on two input numbers, including basic arithmetic, comparison operations, and specific checks like divisibility, odd/even, and prime number identification."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the 'Number Operation' node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Number Operation' node falls under the category of 'WAS Suite/Number/Operations' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the 'Number Operation' node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the 'Number Operation' node are: 'number_a' and 'number_b', which can be either integer or float; and 'operation', which specifies the mathematical operation to be performed and is selected from a list including addition, subtraction, division, and more."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which operations can be specified using the 'operation' input in the 'Number Operation' node?",
        "answer": "The 'operation' input in the 'Number Operation' node can specify operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponentiation, modulus, and various comparison operations like greater-than, less-than, equals, and does not equal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the 'Number Operation' node?",
        "answer": "The 'Number Operation' node provides output in the form of 'number' (preserving the original data type of the input), 'float' for operations where precision is required, and 'int', which is suitable for operations resulting in whole numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the primary outcome of the 'Number Operation' node represented?",
        "answer": "The primary outcome of the 'Number Operation' node is represented by the 'number' output, which is potentially in its original data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type equivalent to the 'INT' output from the 'Number Operation' node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type equivalent to the 'INT' output from the 'Number Operation' node is 'int'."
