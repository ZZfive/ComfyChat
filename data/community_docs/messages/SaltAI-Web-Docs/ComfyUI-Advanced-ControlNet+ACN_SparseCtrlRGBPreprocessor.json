        "question": "What is ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for preprocessing images for use with RGB Sparse ControlNet models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor do?",
        "answer": "ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor adjusts the input image to match the latent size required by the model, encodes it into a latent representation, and wraps this representation for subsequent processing by Advanced ControlNet nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is preprocessing with ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor important?",
        "answer": "Preprocessing with ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor ensures that input images are compatible with the unique requirements of RGB Sparse ControlNet models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor requires inputs such as 'image' of type 'IMAGE', 'vae' of type 'VAE', and 'latent_size' of type 'LATENT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor handle the input image?",
        "answer": "ACN_SparseCtrlRGBPreprocessor resizes and encodes the input image into a latent representation suitable for RGB Sparse ControlNet models."
