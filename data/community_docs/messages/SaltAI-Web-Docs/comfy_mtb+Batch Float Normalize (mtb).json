        "question": "What is the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Batch Float Normalize (mtb) is a custom node in ComfyUI that normalizes a list of float values, adjusting them to a common scale without distorting differences in the range of values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node belongs to the `mtb/batch` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node setting for the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node is an output node set to `False` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node requires a list of float values, denoted as `floats`, for input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which data type does the 'floats' input in the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node correspond to in ComfyUI and Python?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the `floats` input corresponds to the `FLOATS` data type, and in Python, it corresponds to `list[float]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node adjust the output range of float values?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node scales the input values to a range between 0 and 1, ensuring the proportional differences of the original list are maintained."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python class that implements the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Python class that implements the Batch Float Normalize (mtb) node is `MTB_BatchFloatNormalize`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function in the `MTB_BatchFloatNormalize` class is responsible for normalization?",
        "answer": "The function responsible for normalization in the `MTB_BatchFloatNormalize` class is `execute`, which performs the normalization process on the provided list of float values."
