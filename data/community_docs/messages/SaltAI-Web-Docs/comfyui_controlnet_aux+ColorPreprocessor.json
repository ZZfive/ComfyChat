        "question": "What is the purpose of the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to process images by detecting and annotating colors within them, using a specialized color detection model, which is crucial for tasks requiring color analysis or modification before further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ColorPreprocessor node belongs to the category 'ControlNet Preprocessors/T2IAdapter-only' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node type of the ColorPreprocessor in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output node type of the ColorPreprocessor in ComfyUI is 'False', indicating that it is a processing node that does not create a new node to be linked in the graph."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI are typically used for color image preprocessing?",
        "answer": "The ColorPreprocessor node is typically used for preprocessing color images in ComfyUI by detecting and annotating colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the ColorPreprocessor node is 'image', which is the input image to be processed for color detection and annotation, represented as a 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can influence the precision and performance of color detection in the ColorPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' optional input influences the precision and performance of color detection in the ColorPreprocessor node by specifying to what resolution the input image should be resized before processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI, and in what format is it represented?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ColorPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is 'image', representing the processed image with color detection and annotation applied, which is a 'torch.Tensor' in Python."
