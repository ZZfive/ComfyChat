        "question": "What is the WeightScheduleExtend node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "WeightScheduleExtend is a node in ComfyUI under the KJNodes category, designed to extend and convert different value lists or series as needed, supporting various input types and outputting the extended or converted values in specified formats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the WeightScheduleExtend node include `input_values_i`, which is of unknown Python dtype but Comfy dtype FLOAT, and `output_type`, which specifies the desired output format and is of Comfy dtype COMBO[STRING] and Python dtype str."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types supported by the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The WeightScheduleExtend node outputs a float value or a collection of float values, represented by Comfy dtype FLOAT and Python dtype float, depending on the operation performed and the output type specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the WeightScheduleExtend node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The WeightScheduleExtend node belongs to the KJNodes category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is specified by the `output_type` input in the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "The `output_type` input in the WeightScheduleExtend node specifies the desired output format of the extended or converted data, allowing for flexibility in how the results are utilized or further processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the WeightScheduleExtend node detect the type of input values?",
        "answer": "The WeightScheduleExtend node detects the type of input values by checking if they are a list, a pandas Series, or a torch Tensor. It raises a ValueError for unsupported input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the input types of `input_values_1` and `input_values_2` do not match in the WeightScheduleExtend node?",
        "answer": "When the input types of `input_values_1` and `input_values_2` do not match, the WeightScheduleExtend node converts `input_values_2` to the same format as `input_values_1` to ensure they match before performing further operations."
