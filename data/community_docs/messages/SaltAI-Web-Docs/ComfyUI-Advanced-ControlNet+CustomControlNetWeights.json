        "question": "What is CustomControlNetWeights in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CustomControlNetWeights is a class in ComfyUI designed for loading and applying custom control net weights to influence the behavior of an advanced control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CustomControlNetWeights allow you to do?",
        "answer": "CustomControlNetWeights allows you to fine-tune the control network's response by adjusting individual weight parameters and optionally flipping the weights to achieve desired effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CustomControlNetWeights adjust control net weights?",
        "answer": "CustomControlNetWeights adjusts control net weights by accepting parameters such as weight_i and flip_weights, modifying these parameters to influence the behavior of the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by CustomControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CustomControlNetWeights include weight_i of type FLOAT and flip_weights of type BOOLEAN."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of CustomControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "The output types of CustomControlNetWeights include CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS and TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME."

    {
        "question": "How can CustomControlNetWeights be used in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CustomControlNetWeights can be used to load and apply custom control net weights within the control network, adjusting its behavior as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the load_weights method in CustomControlNetWeights?",
        "answer": "The load_weights method in CustomControlNetWeights loads the specified weights and optionally flips them, returning the adjusted control net weights and a timestep keyframe group."
