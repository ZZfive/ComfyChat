        "question": "What is SegmDetectorCombined_v2 and where does it belong in the ComfyUI category?",
        "answer": "SegmDetectorCombined_v2 is a node for image segmentation tasks, combining detection and segmentation processes. It belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Detector' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node in ComfyUI is designed to output a mask representing the segmented areas of the input image by abstracting the complexity of underlying segmentation models and detection algorithms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node include 'segm_detector', 'image', 'threshold', and 'dilation'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'segm_detector' input in the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'segm_detector' input in the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node is the segmentation detector model used for detecting and segmenting objects within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'threshold' input influence the output of the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' input in the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node determines the sensitivity of the segmentation detection by filtering out detections below this threshold."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dilation' input control in SegmDetectorCombined_v2?",
        "answer": "In the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node, the 'dilation' input specifies the dilation level applied to the segmentation masks, affecting the mask's boundary smoothness and size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type produced by the SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node?",
        "answer": "The SegmDetectorCombined_v2 node produces a 'mask' output type, which is a segmentation mask indicating the segmented areas of the input image."
