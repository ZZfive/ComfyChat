    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node are `image` of dtype `IMAGE`, which is the input image to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input controls the maximum number of faces detected in an image?",
        "answer": "The optional input `max_faces` of dtype `INT` controls the maximum number of faces that can be detected in an image by the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `min_confidence` input parameter of the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor adjust?",
        "answer": "The `min_confidence` input parameter adjusts the minimum confidence threshold for detecting faces, allowing for more sensitive adjustment of the balance between detection accuracy and rate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor output?",
        "answer": "The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor outputs a processed `image` of dtype `IMAGE`, which represents the input image with detected face meshes ready for further analysis or visualization."
