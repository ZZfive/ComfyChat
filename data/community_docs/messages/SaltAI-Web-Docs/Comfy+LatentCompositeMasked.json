        "question": "What is LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "LatentCompositeMasked is a node in ComfyUI designed for blending two latent representations together at specified coordinates, optionally using a mask for controlled compositing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "The required input types for LatentCompositeMasked include 'destination' and 'source' latent representations, 'x' and 'y' coordinates for positioning, and a boolean flag 'resize_source' for resizing the source."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentCompositeMasked handle the positioning of the source layer?",
        "answer": "LatentCompositeMasked handles the positioning of the source layer using 'x' and 'y' coordinates in the destination latent representation, allowing precise overlay positioning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the optional 'mask' input in LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "The optional 'mask' input in LatentCompositeMasked controls the blending of the source onto the destination, specifying which parts of the source will be visible in the final composite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "The output type of LatentCompositeMasked is a latent representation, representing the result after compositing the source onto the destination."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Infra type recommended for LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "The Infra type recommended for LatentCompositeMasked is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with LatentCompositeMasked?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used with LatentCompositeMasked include KSamplerAdvanced."
