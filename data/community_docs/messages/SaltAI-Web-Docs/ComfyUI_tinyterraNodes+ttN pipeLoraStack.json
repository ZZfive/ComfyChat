        "question": "What is the purpose of the ttN pipeLoraStack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN pipeLoraStack node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically enhance and modify the capabilities of models and clips by stacking LoRA adjustments based on specified configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'toggle' input in the ttN pipeLoraStack node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'toggle' input determines whether the LoRA stack should be applied or not, acting as a switch to enable or disable the stacking process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the number of LoRA adjustments applied by ttN pipeLoraStack be controlled?",
        "answer": "The number of LoRA adjustments to be applied by the ttN pipeLoraStack node is controlled through the 'num_loras' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different modes of operation for LoRA adjustments in ttN pipeLoraStack?",
        "answer": "The different modes of operation for LoRA adjustments in the ttN pipeLoraStack node are 'simple' and 'advanced', where 'simple' mode applies uniform modification intensity to both model and clip, while 'advanced' mode allows for differentiated intensity for each component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'model_override' and 'clip_override' inputs in ttN pipeLoraStack?",
        "answer": "The 'model_override' and 'clip_override' inputs in the ttN pipeLoraStack node allow for the overriding of the model and clip components within the optional pipeline, facilitating custom adjustments to these components."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ttN pipeLoraStack handle optional pipeline configurations?",
        "answer": "ttN pipeLoraStack can either enhance an existing pipeline with LoRA adjustments if the 'optional_pipe' input is provided, or generate a new configuration if no pipeline is provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'lora_i_strength' input specify in simple mode?",
        "answer": "In simple mode, the 'lora_i_strength' input specifies the strength of the i-th LoRA adjustment applied to both the model and clip, allowing for uniform modification intensity."
