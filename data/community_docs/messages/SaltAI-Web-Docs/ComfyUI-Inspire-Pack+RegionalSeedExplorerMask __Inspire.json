        "question": "What nodes can be used to modify specific regions of an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RegionalSeedExplorerMask node can be used to modify specific regions of an image in ComfyUI by applying variations to noise patterns based on seed prompts and masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node specifies the region within the noise pattern where the seed prompt variations will be applied, enabling targeted modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'noise_mode' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'noise_mode' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node specifies whether the processing should be performed on the CPU or GPU, affecting performance and resource utilization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the 'noise' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'noise' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node accepts input of type 'NOISE' with a torch.Tensor Python data type, representing the initial noise pattern to which the seed prompt variations will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'seed_prompt' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed_prompt' parameter in the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node contains the seed prompts that define the variations to be applied to the noise pattern, guiding the generation of specific visual outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node described?",
        "answer": "The output of the RegionalSeedExplorerMask node is the modified noise pattern, reflecting the applied seed prompt variations within the specified mask region, output as type 'NOISE' with a torch.Tensor Python data type."
