        "question": "What is the output node type for ExtendFloatList?",
        "answer": "The ExtendFloatList node is not an output node, as indicated by the parameter 'False'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter determines the number of float lists to be concatenated by ExtendFloatList?",
        "answer": "The parameter `inputs_len` specifies the number of float lists to be concatenated. This affects the node's execution and the size of the resulting list."
