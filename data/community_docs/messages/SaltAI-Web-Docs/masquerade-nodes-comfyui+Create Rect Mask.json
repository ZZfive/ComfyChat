        "question": "What is the Create Rect Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to generate rectangular masks based on specified dimensions and origin points."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Create Rect Mask node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node belongs to the Masquerade Nodes category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Create Rect Mask node create masks relative to the image size?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node supports creating masks in either percentage or pixel modes, allowing for flexible mask creation relative to the image size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters does the Create Rect Mask node use for defining the mask's position?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node uses the 'origin' parameter to determine the starting point of the mask within the image, which can be any of the four corners, influencing the mask's position."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'mode' parameter in the Create Rect Mask node?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' parameter in the Create Rect Mask node specifies the mode of dimension calculation for the mask, either as a percentage of the image size or in absolute pixels, affecting how the mask's dimensions are interpreted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Create Rect Mask adjust its dimensions with a reference image?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node can adapt the mask size automatically if a reference image is provided, ensuring the mask aligns perfectly with the image dimensions by using the 'copy_image_size' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type is optional in the Create Rect Mask node and what is its purpose?",
        "answer": "The optional input type 'copy_image_size' in the Create Rect Mask node is used to automatically adjust the mask dimensions to match the size of a reference image, overriding the image_width and image_height parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Create Rect Mask node provide?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node outputs a rectangular mask as a tensor with the dimensions and position based on the input parameters, with the dtype 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'x' in the Create Rect Mask node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'x' parameter in the Create Rect Mask node represents the x-coordinate of the mask's origin, which sets the horizontal starting point of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter 'y' in the Create Rect Mask node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'y' parameter in the Create Rect Mask node represents the y-coordinate of the mask's origin, which sets the vertical starting point of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what infrastructure type is the Create Rect Mask node most efficient?",
        "answer": "The Create Rect Mask node is most efficient in an infrastructure type specified as 'GPU'."
