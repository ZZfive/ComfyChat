        "question": "What is ModelSamplingDiscrete?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingDiscrete is a class in ComfyUI that modifies the sampling behavior of a model by applying a discrete sampling strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ModelSamplingDiscrete belong to?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingDiscrete belongs to the category 'advanced/model' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ModelSamplingDiscrete modify?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingDiscrete modifies the sampling behavior of a given model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ModelSamplingDiscrete?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ModelSamplingDiscrete include 'model' of type 'MODEL', 'sampling' of type 'COMBO[STRING]', and 'zsnr' of type 'BOOLEAN'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ModelSamplingDiscrete adjust the model's noise reduction strategy?",
        "answer": "ModelSamplingDiscrete adjusts the model's noise reduction strategy based on the zero-shot noise ratio (zsnr) setting, which can influence the quality of generated samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ModelSamplingDiscrete?",
        "answer": "The output type of ModelSamplingDiscrete is 'MODEL'."

        "question": "What are some common nodes associated with ModelSamplingDiscrete?",
        "answer": "Common nodes associated with ModelSamplingDiscrete include Reroute, KSampler, SamplerCustom, CR Module Pipe Loader, Anything Everywhere, ReroutePrimitive, BasicScheduler, and KSampler (Efficient)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the patch method in ModelSamplingDiscrete do?",
        "answer": "The patch method in ModelSamplingDiscrete clones the input model and applies a specified discrete sampling strategy. It optionally adjusts the model's noise reduction strategy based on the zsnr setting."
