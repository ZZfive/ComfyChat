        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToCondList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToCondList node in ComfyUI is designed to create lists of conditioning data from individual conditioning inputs, streamlining the aggregation of multiple conditioning elements into a single, organized list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does ToCondList belong to within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ToCondList belongs to the 'Bmad/Lists/Make or Intercalate' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'inputs_len' parameter in ToCondList specify?",
        "answer": "The 'inputs_len' parameter in ToCondList specifies the number of individual conditioning elements to be aggregated into a list, which is essential for determining the size of the resulting conditioning list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'conditioning' output in ToCondList?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'conditioning' output in ToCondList is 'CONDITIONING', which is represented as a list of conditioning data aggregated from individual inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'comfy dtype' of 'INT' signify for the 'inputs_len' parameter in ToCondList?",
        "answer": "The 'comfy dtype' of 'INT' for the 'inputs_len' parameter in ToCondList signifies that this parameter expects an integer value to determine the number of conditioning elements to aggregate."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way does the ToCondList node facilitate the use of conditioning data?",
        "answer": "ToCondList facilitates the use of conditioning data by preparing a list of conditioning data aggregated from individual inputs, which is ready for processes requiring conditioning data in a collective format."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the 'conditioning' output in ToCondList utilized?",
        "answer": "The 'conditioning' output in ToCondList, which is a list of aggregated conditioning data, is utilized in processes that require conditioning data in a collective format, streamlining manipulation and application."
