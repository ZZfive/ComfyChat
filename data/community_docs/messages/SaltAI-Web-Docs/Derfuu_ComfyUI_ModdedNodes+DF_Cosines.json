        "question": "What does the DF_Cosines node calculate?",
        "answer": "The DF_Cosines node calculates the cosine of a given angle, with the option to compute the arc cosine instead, supporting angles in both degrees and radians."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the DF_Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the DF_Cosines node are a `value` which represents the numerical value of the angle and a `type_` that specifies the unit of the input angle as either radians or degrees."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the arc cosine operation triggered in the DF_Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The arc cosine operation in the DF_Cosines node is triggered by setting the `arcCos` boolean flag to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the DF_Cosines node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Cosines node is `float`, representing the result of the cosine (or arc cosine) calculation for the given angle."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DF_Cosines node convert degrees to radians?",
        "answer": "If the angle unit is specified as degrees, the DF_Cosines node converts the angle to radians using the `math.radians(value)` function before performing the trigonometric calculation."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which circumstances will DF_Cosines calculate the arc cosine instead of the cosine?",
        "answer": "DF_Cosines will calculate the arc cosine instead of the cosine if the Boolean value of the `arcCos` input is set to True."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category in which the DF_Cosines node is classified?",
        "answer": "The DF_Cosines node is classified under the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Math/Trigonometry`."
