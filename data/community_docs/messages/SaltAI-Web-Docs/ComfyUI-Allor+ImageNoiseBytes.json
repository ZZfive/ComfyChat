        "question": "What is ImageNoiseBytes?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBytes is a node in ComfyUI that applies a noise transformation to images, adjusting pixel values based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ImageNoiseBytes manipulate?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBytes manipulates pixel values of images across specified channels to enhance them with a noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ImageNoiseBytes?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBytes requires inputs such as images, monochromatic settings, inversion specifications, and specific channels for noise application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ImageNoiseBytes?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageNoiseBytes is an image with the applied noise effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageNoiseBytes handle monochromatic noise?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBytes handles monochromatic noise by applying the effect either uniformly across all channels or individually per channel, based on the provided settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'invert' parameter do in ImageNoiseBytes?",
        "answer": "The 'invert' parameter in ImageNoiseBytes alters the visual contrast of the noise effect by specifying whether the effect should be applied inversely."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the usage tips for ImageNoiseBytes?",
        "answer": "ImageNoiseBytes is optimized for GPU usage and operates effectively with images to produce noise effects."
