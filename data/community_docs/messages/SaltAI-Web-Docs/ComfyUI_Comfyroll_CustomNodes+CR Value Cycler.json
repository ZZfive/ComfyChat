        "question": "What is the CR Value Cycler node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Cycler node is designed to cycle through a list of values, repeating each value a specified number of times and looping through the entire list for a given number of iterations. It is capable of parsing numeric values from a multiline string, converting them into floats and integers, and outputting these numbers in separate lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is crucial for defining the set of values that the CR Value Cycler node will operate on?",
        "answer": "The crucial input for defining the set of values is `values`, which is a multiline string containing values to be cycled through."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Value Cycler node handle the repetition of each value?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Cycler node allows specifying how many times each value should be repeated in a single loop through the `repeats` input, which affects the length and repetition pattern of the output lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the number of times the entire set of values is cycled through in the CR Value Cycler node?",
        "answer": "The input `loops` determines the number of times the entire set of values is cycled through. This influences the total number of iterations and the final size of the output lists."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the CR Value Cycler node generate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Cycler node generates a list of floating-point numbers and a list of integers, both of which are output types. Additionally, it outputs a URL to a help page providing additional information and guidance on using the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the URL to the help page for using the CR Value Cycler node?",
        "answer": "The URL to the help page for using the CR Value Cycler node is https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/List-Nodes#cr-value-cycler."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Value Cycler node parse and convert numeric values from the input string?",
        "answer": "The CR Value Cycler node parses and converts numeric values from the input string by first splitting the multiline string into lines, checking if each line is a valid number, converting the line to a float, and then converting that float to an integer for the separate integer output list."
