        "question": "What is BasicGuider?",
        "answer": "BasicGuider is a class in ComfyUI under the category 'sampling/custom_sampling/guiders'. It provides a mechanism to create a guider object with basic conditioning for custom sampling processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by BasicGuider?",
        "answer": "BasicGuider requires two input types: 'model' and 'conditioning'. 'model' specifies the model used to guide the sampling process, while 'conditioning' defines the conditions under which the sampling occurs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of BasicGuider?",
        "answer": "The output type of BasicGuider is a guider object ('GUIDER'), configured with the specified model and conditioning, ready to guide the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does BasicGuider encapsulate functionality?",
        "answer": "BasicGuider encapsulates functionality by creating a guider object using the provided model and setting conditions for the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for 'model' in BasicGuider?",
        "answer": "In Python, the dtype for 'model' in BasicGuider is 'comfy.samplers.CFGGuider or similar class'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does BasicGuider's 'get_guider' function do?",
        "answer": "The 'get_guider' function in BasicGuider initializes a Guider_Basic instance with the provided model and conditions, returning the configured guider object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infra does BasicGuider support?",
        "answer": "BasicGuider supports 'CPU' infrastructure."
