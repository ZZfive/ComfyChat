        "question": "What is ImageAlphaComposite?",
        "answer": "ImageAlphaComposite is a node in ComfyUI designed to blend two images based on their alpha values to create a single composited image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageAlphaComposite node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageAlphaComposite node blends two input images together using their alpha values, resulting in a composite image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the ImageAlphaComposite node?",
        "answer": "The ImageAlphaComposite node requires the following input types: image_1 and image_2. Both inputs are of type IMAGE in ComfyUI and torch.Tensor in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageAlphaComposite node handle input images?",
        "answer": "The ImageAlphaComposite node ensures that the input images must have the same dimensions and channels for proper blending."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageAlphaComposite node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageAlphaComposite node is IMAGE in ComfyUI and torch.Tensor in Python, representing the composited image."
