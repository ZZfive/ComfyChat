        "question": "What is the purpose of the ExtendStringList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendStringList node in ComfyUI is designed to concatenate multiple lists of strings into a single, extended list, making it useful for aggregating and manipulating string data from various sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ExtendStringList node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ExtendStringList node belongs to the category `Bmad/Lists/Extend` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the number of string lists that the ExtendStringList node will concatenate?",
        "answer": "The number of string lists that the ExtendStringList node will concatenate is determined by the `inputs_len` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `inputs_len` parameter in ExtendStringList expect?",
        "answer": "The `inputs_len` parameter in ExtendStringList expects an integer value, specifically an `INT` type in Comfy dtype and `int` type in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ExtendStringList node output and what is its type?",
        "answer": "The ExtendStringList node outputs a list of strings, which is the result of concatenating all provided string lists. Its type in Comfy dtype is `STRING` and in Python dtype is `List[str]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of operation is the ExtendStringList node best suited for?",
        "answer": "The ExtendStringList node is best suited for operations that involve the aggregation and manipulation of string data from various sources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of operations can be facilitated by the ExtendStringList node?",
        "answer": "The ExtendStringList node can facilitate operations that involve the manipulation or analysis of collective string datasets."
