        "question": "What is the SaltMaskSkeletonization node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSkeletonization node in ComfyUI is designed to transform input mask images into their skeletonized versions, reducing the masks to their simplest form while preserving their overall geometry."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of functionality does the SaltMaskSkeletonization node offer in terms of processing mask images?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskSkeletonization node is used to process mask images by converting them into skeletal representations, which are minimalistic forms of the masks that maintain their overall structural geometry."
    },
    {
        "question": "What influences the thinness of the resulting skeleton in the SaltMaskSkeletonization process?",
        "answer": "The thinness of the resulting skeleton is influenced by the 'iterations' parameter, which specifies the number of times the erosion operation is applied to each mask during the SaltMaskSkeletonization process."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, which input adjusts the intensity of the skeletonization process?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the 'strength' input parameter in the SaltMaskSkeletonization node adjusts the intensity of the skeletonization process, affecting the prominence of the final skeletal structure's features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output dtype of skeletonized masks generated by the SaltMaskSkeletonization node?",
        "answer": "The output dtype of the skeletonized masks generated by the SaltMaskSkeletonization node is `MASK`, represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which required input must be provided to the SaltMaskSkeletonization node for it to function in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltMaskSkeletonization node to function in ComfyUI is 'masks', which are the input masks to be skeletonized, where each mask represents a distinct region to be processed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SaltMaskSkeletonization node in ComfyUI's node system?",
        "answer": "The return type of the SaltMaskSkeletonization node in ComfyUI's node system is ('MASK',), which represents the output tensor containing the skeletonized versions of the input masks."
