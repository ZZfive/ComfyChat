        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageGridComposite3x3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite3x3 node in ComfyUI is designed to concatenate nine input images into a single 3x3 grid, creating a composite image that showcases all inputs in a structured layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is placed in the top-left corner by the ImageGridComposite3x3 node?",
        "answer": "The first image input, denoted `image1`, is placed in the top-left corner of the 3x3 grid by the ImageGridComposite3x3 node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the `image9` parameter of the ImageGridComposite3x3 node have?",
        "answer": "The `image9` parameter of the ImageGridComposite3x3 node has Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many input images are required by the ImageGridComposite3x3 node?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite3x3 node requires nine input images, named `image1` to `image9`, to generate the 3x3 grid composite."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output generated by the ImageGridComposite3x3 node?",
        "answer": "The output data type generated by the ImageGridComposite3x3 node is `IMAGE` in Comfy dtype and `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `compositegrid` method of the ImageGridComposite3x3 class do?",
        "answer": "The `compositegrid` method of the ImageGridComposite3x3 class concatenates the nine input images into a 3x3 grid by first creating the top, middle and bottom rows separately, then stacking these rows vertically using `torch.cat`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImageGridComposite3x3 node fall under in the ComfyUI node library?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite3x3 node falls under the `KJNodes/image` category in the ComfyUI node library."
