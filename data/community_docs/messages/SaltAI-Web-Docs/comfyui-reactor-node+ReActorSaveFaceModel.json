        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorSaveFaceModel node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorSaveFaceModel node in ComfyUI is designed to save a face model after processing an image or a set of images. It analyzes faces, selects a specific face based on an index, and saves the analyzed face model for future use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'save_mode' input in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node dictate?",
        "answer": "The 'save_mode' input in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node determines whether the face model should be saved. It affects the node's operation by either proceeding with saving the model or skipping this step."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the saved face model named in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The saved face model in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node is named based on the 'face_model_name' input, which is used to create the file name for the saved model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'select_face_index' input play in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The 'select_face_index' input in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node specifies the index of the face to select from the analyzed faces in the image, allowing for specific face selection within a group of detected faces."
    },
    {
        "question": "When using the ReActorSaveFaceModel node, what is the significance of an 'image' input?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node is optional and used to build the face model when an image is provided for analysis instead of a pre-analyzed face model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the alternative input to 'image' for building a face model in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "The alternative to the 'image' input for building a face model in the ReActorSaveFaceModel node is the 'face_model' input, which accepts a pre-analyzed face model that can be saved directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is GPU processing available for the ReActorSaveFaceModel node?",
        "answer": "Yes, the ReActorSaveFaceModel node supports GPU processing for enhanced performance, indicated by its 'infra type' listed as 'GPU'."
