        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageBatchToList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchToList node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a batch of images into a list format, facilitating operations that require individual image processing or manipulation within a batch context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImageBatchToList node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchToList node belongs to the 'Bmad/image' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for the ImageBatchToList node to perform its function?",
        "answer": "The input `images`, which represents the batch of images to be converted into a list, is crucial for the ImageBatchToList node to perform its function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the input to the ImageBatchToList node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the input to the ImageBatchToList node is `IMAGE`, and the Python dtype is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageBatchToList node output and in what format?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchToList node outputs a list of images, where each image in the batch is separated and is now an individual element in the list. The dtype for the output in Comfy is `IMAGE`, and in Python, it is `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly associated with the ImageBatchToList node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with the ImageBatchToList node are currently unknown."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageBatchToList node output a list according to the ComfyUI specifications?",
        "answer": "Yes, according to the ComfyUI specifications, the output of the ImageBatchToList node is marked as a list."
