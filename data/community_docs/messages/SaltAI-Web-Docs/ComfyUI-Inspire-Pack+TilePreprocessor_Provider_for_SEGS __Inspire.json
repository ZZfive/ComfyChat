        "question": "What is the purpose of the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is to provide a preprocessing service for SEGS (Semantic Edge Guided Synthesis) by applying a tile preprocessing technique to enhance the input data for better performance in SEGS applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the parameter `pyrUp_iters` in the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS control?",
        "answer": "The parameter `pyrUp_iters` controls the number of iterations for pyramid upscaling, which affects the final resolution of the processed image. A higher number of iterations results in a finer resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `segs_preprocessor` output from the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS represent?",
        "answer": "The `segs_preprocessor` output represents a preprocessed object ready for SEGS processing, encapsulating the adjustments made during the tile preprocessing phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS belongs to the category 'InspirePack/SEGS/ControlNet' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the computing apparatus used by the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The computing apparatus used by the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS is specified as the CPU (Infra type: CPU)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is the `pyrUp_iters` parameter when using the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS?",
        "answer": "The `pyrUp_iters` parameter is of type `INT` in the Comfy dtype and `int` in the Python dtype when using the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What specific Python class implements the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The specific Python class that implements the Tile Preprocessor Provider for SEGS in ComfyUI is `TilePreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS`."
