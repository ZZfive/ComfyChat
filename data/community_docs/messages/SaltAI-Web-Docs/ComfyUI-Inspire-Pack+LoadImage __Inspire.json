        "question": "What is the LoadImage __Inspire node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadImage __Inspire node is designed to load and preprocess images for use in image processing workflows, handling image loading from a specified directory, applying necessary transformations, and optionally generating a mask for images with transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LoadImage __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LoadImage __Inspire node are `image` and `image_data`. `image` specifies the image file to be loaded, and `image_data` provides the image data in a base64-encoded string format for alternative loading."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the LoadImage __Inspire node in ComfyUI provide?",
        "answer": "The LoadImage __Inspire node provides two output types: `image` as a processed image ready for use in subsequent tasks, and `mask` which is an optional output providing a mask for images with transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data is returned by the `image` output of the LoadImage __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The `image` output returns a processed image in the form of a normalized tensor, which is represented by the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the mask output of the LoadImage __Inspire node represent?",
        "answer": "The mask output of the LoadImage __Inspire node represents areas of interest or exclusion in images with transparency, aiding in further processing steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name used by the LoadImage __Inspire node to load and process images?",
        "answer": "The function name used by the LoadImage __Inspire node to load and process images is `load_image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which device type is recommended for better performance when using the LoadImage __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LoadImage __Inspire node in ComfyUI recommends using an `GPU` for infrastructure to achieve better performance."
