        "question": "What is the role of the PreviewLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PreviewLatent node in ComfyUI is used to generate visual previews of latent representations by leveraging a base model and optional parameters to produce images that represent the encoded information within a latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the PreviewLatent node require?",
        "answer": "The PreviewLatent node requires the latent representation (`latent`), which is the core input for generating the preview image. The data type for this input in ComfyUI is `LATENT`, and in Python, it is `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the PreviewLatent node return?",
        "answer": "The PreviewLatent node returns the same latent input (`latent`), allowing for further processing or analysis if needed. The returned data type in ComfyUI is `LATENT`, and in Python, it is `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the execution environment for the PreviewLatent node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The PreviewLatent node in ComfyUI is executed using the GPU, as indicated by its infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `preview_basic` function used in the PreviewLatent node for generating previews?",
        "answer": "The `preview_basic` function is used in the PreviewLatent node for generating previews by utilizing the `lpreview` method of a derived class, `PreviewLatentAdvanced`, with the `latent` input and setting parameters such as `base_model` and `preview_method`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between PreviewLatent and PreviewLatentAdvanced in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `PreviewLatent` class in ComfyUI is a subclass of `PreviewLatentAdvanced` and uses its methods and functionalities for producing image previews from latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the hierarchy in the source code of PreviewLatent in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "In the source code, the `PreviewLatent` class inherits from `PreviewLatentAdvanced`, and its `lpreview_basic` method calls the `lpreview` method of `PreviewLatentAdvanced`, passing parameters such as `latent`, `base_model`, and `preview_method`."
