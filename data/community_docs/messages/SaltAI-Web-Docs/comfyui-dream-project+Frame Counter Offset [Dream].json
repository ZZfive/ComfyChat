    {
        "question": "What does the Frame Counter Offset node allow you to do?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Offset node allows you to dynamically alter animation timelines by shifting or delaying animation sequences based on the original frame count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Frame Counter Offset node include 'frame_counter', which represents the current state of an animation's frame count, and 'offset', which specifies the number of frames by which the frame counter should be adjusted."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Frame Counter Offset node modify the animation timeline?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Offset node modifies the animation timeline by incrementing or decrementing the frame counter by the specified offset value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Frame Counter Offset node is 'frame_counter', which reflects the modified frame counter after applying the specified offset."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming language is used for implementing the Frame Counter Offset node?",
        "answer": "The Frame Counter Offset node is implemented using Python."
