        "question": "What is the FL_Ripple node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The FL_Ripple node in ComfyUI applies a ripple effect to a collection of images, transforming each one by simulating a ripple pattern through mathematical manipulation of the image pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the FL_Ripple node is a collection of images (`images`), and the optional input types include amplitude (`amplitude`), frequency (`frequency`), and phase (`phase`), all of which are FLOAT types in Comfy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the amplitude parameter affect the output of the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The amplitude parameter in the FL_Ripple node defines the height of the ripple waves. Higher values of amplitude result in more pronounced ripples in the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the frequency parameter have on the images processed by the FL_Ripple node?",
        "answer": "The frequency parameter in the FL_Ripple node determines the number of ripples in the image. Higher frequencies result in more ripples within a given space in the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the FL_Ripple node represented?",
        "answer": "The output of the FL_Ripple node is an image with the ripple effect applied, represented as a tensor of type `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used to apply a ripple effect to images?",
        "answer": "The FL_Ripple node in ComfyUI is used to apply a ripple effect to images by transforming them through simulating a ripple pattern based on specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the node that simulates a ripple pattern on images?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the node that simulates a ripple pattern on images is `FL_Ripple`."
