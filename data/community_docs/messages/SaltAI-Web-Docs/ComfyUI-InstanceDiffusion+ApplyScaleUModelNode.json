        "question": "What is the ApplyScaleUModelNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ApplyScaleUModelNode is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to enhance the capabilities of a given model by applying a ScaleU patch, which modifies the model's internal processing to incorporate additional scaling adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ApplyScaleUModelNode belong to?",
        "answer": "ApplyScaleUModelNode belongs to the 'instance' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input represent in the ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in ApplyScaleUModelNode represents the model to which the ScaleU patch will be applied, determining the base model that will be enhanced with the ScaleU technique."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype of the 'model' input in ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype of the 'model' input in ApplyScaleUModelNode is 'torch.nn.Module'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ApplyScaleUModelNode output?",
        "answer": "The ApplyScaleUModelNode outputs the enhanced model with the ScaleU patch applied, reflecting the modifications made to the original model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the dtype of the output model from the ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The dtype of the output model from ApplyScaleUModelNode is 'MODEL' in Comfy, and 'torch.nn.Module' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'scaleu' input in ApplyScaleUModelNode?",
        "answer": "The 'scaleu' input in ApplyScaleUModelNode is used to specify the ScaleU configuration to be applied to the model, defining the specific scaling adjustments and enhancements that will be made to the model."
