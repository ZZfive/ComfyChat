        "question": "What is ADE_LoraHookKeyframe?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoraHookKeyframe is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for creating LoRA hook keyframes, allowing dynamic scheduling of LoRA hooks' strength within animation sequences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_LoraHookKeyframe facilitate?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoraHookKeyframe facilitates the management and application of LoRA hook keyframes, enabling precise control over the influence of LoRA hooks throughout an animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ADE_LoraHookKeyframe?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoraHookKeyframe requires input types such as strength_model of type FLOAT, start_percent of type FLOAT, and guarantee_steps of type INT."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does start_percent affect ADE_LoraHookKeyframe?",
        "answer": "start_percent in ADE_LoraHookKeyframe determines the starting point of the keyframe's effect as a percentage of the total animation length, allowing precise timing of the LoRA hook's influence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ADE_LoraHookKeyframe?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoraHookKeyframe outputs a group of LoRA hook keyframes (LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES), including the newly created keyframe, for managing multiple keyframes within animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can ADE_LoraHookKeyframe manage multiple keyframes?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoraHookKeyframe manages multiple keyframes by returning a group of LoRA hook keyframes (LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES) that includes the newly created keyframe."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of prev_hook_kf in ADE_LoraHookKeyframe?",
        "answer": "prev_hook_kf in ADE_LoraHookKeyframe is an optional parameter for specifying a previous LoRA hook keyframe group to which the new keyframe will be added, enabling chaining of multiple keyframes for complex animation effects."
