        "question": "What is the class name for the RemapBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the RemapBarrelDistortion node is `RemapBarrelDistortion`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the RemapBarrelDistortion node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapBarrelDistortion node falls under the category `Bmad/CV/Transform` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the RemapBarrelDistortion node primarily do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapBarrelDistortion node is used to adjust images by applying barrel distortion correction or introducing barrel distortion effects, manipulating image geometry to correct lens-induced distortions or create visual effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the coefficient 'a' in the RemapBarrelDistortion node of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The coefficient 'a' in the RemapBarrelDistortion node influences the degree of distortion applied to the image, playing a significant role in both correcting and creating barrel distortion effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the use of the 'use_inverse_variant' parameter affect the output of the RemapBarrelDistortion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'use_inverse_variant' parameter, a boolean, decides whether to use an alternative formula for computing the distortion in the RemapBarrelDistortion node, thus influencing the final appearance of the remapped image in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the `remap` output of the RemapBarrelDistortion node represent?",
        "answer": "The `remap` output of the RemapBarrelDistortion node represents a transformation map for applying barrel distortion effect to an image, enabling correction or introduction of distortion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can be used in the RemapBarrelDistortion node to further adjust the distortion effect?",
        "answer": "An optional input 'd' can be used in the RemapBarrelDistortion node to further adjust the distortion effect, offering additional control over the image transformation process."
