        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI is designed to identify and isolate the ceiling regions within a given set of masks, facilitating focused analysis or modifications on these specific regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node belongs to the 'SALT/Masking/Filter' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is 'masks', which should be of Comfy dtype: 'MASK' and Python dtype: 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node produce?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node produces output masks with the ceiling regions identified and isolated from the original input masks. The output has the Comfy dtype: 'MASK' and Python dtype: 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node determine ceiling regions in masks?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskCeilingRegion node determines ceiling regions in masks by processing each mask to highlight the ceiling areas. This is achieved by converting the input masks to PIL images, applying a ceiling region filter, and then converting back to torch tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node in ComfyUI is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the ceiling_region function in the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node?",
        "answer": "The return type of the ceiling_region function in the SaltMaskCeilingRegion node is ('MASK'), which corresponds to the output masks with ceiling regions identified."
