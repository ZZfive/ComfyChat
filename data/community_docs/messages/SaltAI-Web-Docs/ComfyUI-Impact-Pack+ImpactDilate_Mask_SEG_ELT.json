        "question": "What is the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI is designed to apply dilation to the mask of a single segmentation element (SEG_ELT), enabling the adjustment of the mask's boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node falls under the ImpactPack/Util category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does 'seg_elt' represent in the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The 'seg_elt' input represents a single segmentation element (SEG_ELT) whose mask will be modified through dilation, depending on the dilation parameter value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'dilation' input in the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' input specifies the intensity of the mask's modification, where positive values cause dilation, expanding the mask, which is essential for adjusting the segmentation mask's boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to the `seg_elt` as an output of the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node?",
        "answer": "The output `seg_elt` from the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node is a modified single segmentation element (SEG_ELT) with its mask dilated, which refines control over the segmentation mask's boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is associated with the functionality of the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class associated with the functionality of the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node is `Dilate_SEG_ELT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does the ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node use for processing?",
        "answer": "The ImpactDilate_Mask_SEG_ELT node uses the CPU for processing."
