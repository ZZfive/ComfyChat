        "question": "What class name does the node that applies a distance transform to a binary image have?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that applies a distance transform to a binary image is `DistanceTransform`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `DistanceTransform` node do?",
        "answer": "The `DistanceTransform` node in ComfyUI applies a distance transform to a binary image, converting it into a grayscale image where each pixel's intensity is proportional to its distance from the nearest binary foreground pixel."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the `DistanceTransform` node?",
        "answer": "You can find the `DistanceTransform` node in the `Bmad/CV/Thresholding` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the binary image that the `DistanceTransform` node accepts?",
        "answer": "The `DistanceTransform` node accepts a binary image with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `distance_type` input in the `DistanceTransform` node?",
        "answer": "The `distance_type` input in the `DistanceTransform` node specifies the type of distance calculation to use, allowing for customization of the distance transform effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which distance types are supported by the `DistanceTransform` node?",
        "answer": "The `DistanceTransform` node supports distance types including `DIST_L2`, `DIST_L1`, and `DIST_C`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the granularity of the distance calculation in the `DistanceTransform` node?",
        "answer": "The granularity of the distance calculation in the `DistanceTransform` node is determined by the `mask_size` input, which can be `DIST_MASK_3`, `DIST_MASK_5`, or `DIST_MASK_PRECISE`."
