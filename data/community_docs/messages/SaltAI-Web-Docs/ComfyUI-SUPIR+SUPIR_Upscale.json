        "question": "What is the SUPIR_Upscale node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_Upscale node in ComfyUI is designed to upscale images using the SUPIR model, enhancing image resolution while maintaining or improving image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SUPIR_Upscale node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_Upscale node belongs to the 'SUPIR' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node specifies the main input image to be upscaled in the SUPIR_Upscale process?",
        "answer": "The `image` node specifies the main input image to be upscaled in the SUPIR_Upscale process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `sdxl_model` input play in the SUPIR_Upscale process?",
        "answer": "The `sdxl_model` input determines the secondary model used in conjunction with the SUPIR model to enhance the upscaling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters are essential for reproducing the same upscaling results in the SUPIR_Upscale process?",
        "answer": "The `seed` parameter is essential for reproducing the same upscaling results in the SUPIR_Upscale process by setting the seed for random number generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `scale_by` parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node determine?",
        "answer": "The `scale_by` parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale node determines the factor by which the image will be upscaled, directly influencing the resolution of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `control_scale` parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale process?",
        "answer": "The `control_scale` parameter in the SUPIR_Upscale process adjusts the control scale for the upscaling process, affecting the overall control over the upscaling outcome."
