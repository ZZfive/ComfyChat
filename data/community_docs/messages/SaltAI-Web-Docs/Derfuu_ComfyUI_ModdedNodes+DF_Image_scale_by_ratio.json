        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node in ComfyUI is designed to upscale an image by a specified ratio, applying a chosen upscale method and optionally cropping the image. Its primary function is to adjust the image's dimensions based on a scaling factor, enhancing the image quality or fitting it into a desired size while maintaining its aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Image scale by ratio node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Image scale by ratio node is `DF_Image_scale_by_ratio`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used in ComfyUI to upscale an image by a certain ratio?",
        "answer": "The `DF_Image_scale_by_ratio` node can be used in ComfyUI to upscale an image by a specific ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output from the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output from the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node is `IMAGE`, represented as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the base for scaling and the subject of the upscale process in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The image to be upscaled is the input that determines the base for scaling and is the subject of the upscale process in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node. It is crucial for the node's operation as it is the basis for scaling and the subject of the upscale process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'crop' input in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node control?",
        "answer": "The 'crop' input in the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node determines if and how the upscaled image should be cropped, affecting the final composition and aspect ratio of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure requirement must be met for using the DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Image_scale_by_ratio node requires the infrastructure type 'GPU' to be used effectively."
