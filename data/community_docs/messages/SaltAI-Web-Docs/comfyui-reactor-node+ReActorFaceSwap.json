        "question": "What is the purpose of the ReActorFaceSwap node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ReActorFaceSwap node in ComfyUI is designed for rapidly swapping faces within images, utilizing advanced face detection and swapping algorithms to achieve high-quality results, making it ideal for applications requiring dynamic face replacement or augmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type controls whether face restoration is applied post-swap in the ReActorFaceSwap node?",
        "answer": "The input type 'face_restore_model' controls whether face restoration is applied post-swap in the ReActorFaceSwap node, ensuring high-quality and natural-looking results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type in ReActorFaceSwap adjusts the visibility of the restoration process in the output?",
        "answer": "The 'face_restore_visibility' input type adjusts the visibility of the restoration process in the output of the ReActorFaceSwap node, allowing for fine-tuning of the final image appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'codeformer_weight' input type in ReActorFaceSwap control?",
        "answer": "The 'codeformer_weight' input type in ReActorFaceSwap controls the weight of the CodeFormer model in the restoration process, balancing between the original and enhanced face features."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used for saving videos?",
        "answer": "The 'SaveVideo' node in ComfyUI is used for saving videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type in ReActorFaceSwap determines the model used for swapping faces?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_model' input type in ReActorFaceSwap determines the model used for swapping faces, which directly influences the quality and style of the swap."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'enabled' input type in the ReActorFaceSwap node control?",
        "answer": "The 'enabled' input type in the ReActorFaceSwap node is a flag that enables or disables the face swapping process, allowing for conditional execution within a workflow."
