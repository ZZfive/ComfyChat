        "question": "What does the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node do?",
        "answer": "The GroundingDinoSAMSegment node is designed to segment various objects within an image using the capabilities of the GroundingDINO model and SAM model in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which models are required as inputs for the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node?",
        "answer": "The GroundingDinoSAMSegment node requires the SAM model, GroundingDINO model, an image, a text prompt, and a threshold value as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'prompt' in the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node?",
        "answer": "The 'prompt' guides the GroundingDINO model in identifying specific objects of interest within the image for segmentation, helping to focus the model's attention on relevant objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node handle multiple objects in an image?",
        "answer": "The GroundingDinoSAMSegment node returns each segmented object as a separate image along with corresponding masks indicating the area of each object within the original image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node produce?",
        "answer": "The GroundingDinoSAMSegment node produces segmented images and masks corresponding to each segmented object in the input image as output types."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used with GroundingDinoSAMSegment include the PreviewImage node, Reroute, VAEEncodeForInpaint, MaskToImage, Mask Gaussian Region, ArithmeticBlend, and masking nodes like InvertMask and GrowMask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'threshold' input in the GroundingDinoSAMSegment node?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' is a sensitivity setting for object detection by the GroundingDINO model, where objects with confidence scores above this threshold are considered for segmentation."
