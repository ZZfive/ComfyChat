        "question": "What is the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node is designed for performing scheduled shape transformations on images, allowing for dynamic adjustment of image shapes over a sequence of frames based on predefined schedules for parameters such as size, position, and rotation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node include max_frames, image_width, image_height, initial_width, initial_height, initial_x_coord, initial_y_coord, initial_rotation, and shape_mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'shape_mode' parameter in SaltScheduledShapeTransformation control?",
        "answer": "The 'shape_mode' parameter in SaltScheduledShapeTransformation defines the mode or type of shape to be transformed, allowing for various geometric shapes such as circle, diamond, triangle, square, hexagon, or octagon."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used for scheduled shape transformations on images within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node can be used for scheduled shape transformations on images within ComfyUI."

    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional input types for the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node include shape, width_schedule, height_schedule, x_schedule, y_schedule, and rotation_schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary output generated by the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node?",
        "answer": "The primary output generated by the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node is images, which are the result of the scheduled shape transformations applied to the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the maximum number of frames for the transformation sequence in SaltScheduledShapeTransformation?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'max_frames' controls the maximum number of frames for the transformation sequence in the SaltScheduledShapeTransformation node."
