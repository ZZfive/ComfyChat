        "question": "What is the Range(Num Steps) - Float node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node in ComfyUI is used to generate a range of floating-point numbers based on specified start and stop values, and a number of steps. It allows for the creation of evenly spaced sequences of numbers for various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Range(Num Steps) - Float node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node belongs to the 'List Stuff' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Range(Num Steps) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node requires three input types: `start`, `stop`, and `num_steps`. `start` and `stop` are FLOAT types defining the beginning and end of the range, while `num_steps` is an INT type specifying the number of steps within the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Range(Num Steps) - Float node determine the spacing between numbers in the generated sequence?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node determines the spacing between numbers in the generated sequence based on the `num_steps` input, which affects how many intervals are created between the `start` and `stop` values, thereby setting the spacing of the sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Range(Num Steps) - Float node?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node outputs two types: `range` and `range_sizes`. `range` is a list of floating-point numbers representing the generated range, and `range_sizes` is a list containing the size of each generated range, indicating how many numbers are in each sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the Range(Num Steps) - Float node be applied in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range(Num Steps) - Float node in ComfyUI can be applied for generating sample points or defining intervals, providing evenly spaced sequences of numbers that can be used in various creative and computational tasks within the ComfyUI framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the '_decimal_range' method in the Range(Num Steps) - Float node source code?",
        "answer": "The '_decimal_range' method in the Range(Num Steps) - Float node source code is used to generate a sequence of floating-point numbers between a `start` and `stop` value, ensuring that the sequence is evenly spaced based on the number of steps provided."
