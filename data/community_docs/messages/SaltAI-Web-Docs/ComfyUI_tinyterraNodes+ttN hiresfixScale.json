        "question": "What is the role of the ttN hiresfixScale node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ttN hiresfixScale node in ComfyUI specializes in upscaling images through a specific model, enhancing their resolution while optionally adjusting their scale based on various criteria such as percentage increase, maintaining aspect ratio, or targeting a longer side dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the method and quality of upscaling in the ttN hiresfixScale node?",
        "answer": "The method and quality of upscaling in the ttN hiresfixScale node are determined by the model specified in the `model_name` parameter, which defines the technique used to enhance the image resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter is used to determine if an image should be rescaled after processing by the upscaling model in the ttN hiresfixScale node?",
        "answer": "The parameter used to determine if an image should be rescaled after processing by the upscaling model in the ttN hiresfixScale node is `rescale_after_model`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method is specified to rescale the images after upscaling in the ttN hiresfixScale node?",
        "answer": "The method specified to rescale the images after upscaling in the ttN hiresfixScale node is defined by `rescale_method`, which can include techniques such as scaling by percentage or to a specific dimension while maintaining aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the ttN hiresfixScale node determines the scaling approach, whether by a fixed percentage or to a specific longer side dimension?",
        "answer": "The `rescale` parameter in the ttN hiresfixScale node determines the scaling approach, specifying if the scaling is by a fixed percentage or to a specific longer side dimension while preserving aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "When 'rescale' is set to 'by percentage', which parameter controls the scaling factor?",
        "answer": "When 'rescale' is set to 'by percentage' in the ttN hiresfixScale node, the scaling factor is controlled by the `percent` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameter specifies the desired length of the longer side of the image after rescaling, when 'rescale' is set to 'to longer side - maintain aspect', in the ttN hiresfixScale node?",
        "answer": "The desired length of the longer side of the image after rescaling when 'rescale' is set to 'to longer side - maintain aspect' in the ttN hiresfixScale node is specified by the `longer_side` parameter."
