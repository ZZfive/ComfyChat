        "question": "What is the `Inset Image Bounds` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Inset Image Bounds` node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the boundaries of an image by applying insets, effectively shrinking the image's visible area from each edge."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the `Inset Image Bounds` node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `Inset Image Bounds` node belongs to the `WAS Suite/Image/Bound` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the original boundaries of the image for the `Inset Image Bounds` operation?",
        "answer": "The `image_bounds` input specifies the original boundaries of the image to be inset in the `Inset Image Bounds` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you define the reduction in visible width from the left and right sides of an image using the `Inset Image Bounds` node?",
        "answer": "In the `Inset Image Bounds` node, the `inset_left` and `inset_right` inputs define the reduction in visible width from the left and right sides of the image, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of applying insets to the top and bottom boundaries of an image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Applying insets to the top and bottom boundaries of an image using the `inset_top` and `inset_bottom` inputs in the `Inset Image Bounds` node reduces the visible height from the top and bottom of the image, focusing on central parts or creating margins."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of check is performed on the new boundaries after applying insets in the `Inset Image Bounds` node?",
        "answer": "After applying insets in the `Inset Image Bounds` node, a check is performed to ensure that the insets do not exceed the original image bounds; an error is raised if the insets result in invalid boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and its meaning from the `Inset Image Bounds` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type from the `Inset Image Bounds` node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE_BOUNDS`, which represents the new, inset image boundaries after applying the specified insets to each side of the original boundaries."
