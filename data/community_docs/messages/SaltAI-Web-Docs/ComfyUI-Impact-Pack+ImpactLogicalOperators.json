        "question": "What is the ImpactLogicalOperators node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node in ComfyUI is used to perform logical operations (AND, OR, XOR) on two boolean inputs, returning the result as a boolean value. It simplifies complex logical decision-making processes by providing a user-friendly interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImpactLogicalOperators node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node requires three input types: `operator` (a combo of string values specifying the operation: AND, OR, XOR), `bool_a` (the first boolean input), and `bool_b` (the second boolean input)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `operator` input of the ImpactLogicalOperators node determine?",
        "answer": "The `operator` input in the ImpactLogicalOperators node specifies the logical operation to be performed on the two boolean inputs, determining how the two booleans will be combined to produce the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ImpactLogicalOperators node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node outputs a single boolean value resulting from the logical operation performed on the two input booleans."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactLogicalOperators node abstract logical decision-making?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node abstracts complex logical decision-making into a simple interface, enabling the execution of conditional logic flows within ComfyUI by performing logical operations on boolean inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes used in conjunction with the ImpactLogicalOperators node?",
        "answer": "The common nodes associated with the ImpactLogicalOperators node are not specified in the documentation; its use is generally determined by the specific logic flow requirements of a ComfyUI setup."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category does the ImpactLogicalOperators node fall under in the ComfyUI node registry?",
        "answer": "The ImpactLogicalOperators node falls under the 'ImpactPack/Logic' category in the ComfyUI node registry."
