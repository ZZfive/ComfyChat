        "question": "What is the `ImageScaleDownBy` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI is used for scaling down images by a specified factor while maintaining the original aspect ratio, which is useful for optimizing performance or preparing images for specific display requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the `ImageScaleDownBy` node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the `ImageScaleDownBy` node are `images` (representing the images to be scaled down and with Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`), and `scale_by` (specifying the factor by which the images will be scaled down, with Comfy dtype of `FLOAT` and Python dtype of `float`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output dimensions of images when using the `ImageScaleDownBy` node?",
        "answer": "The output dimensions of images processed by the `ImageScaleDownBy` node are adjusted according to the `scale_by` factor, while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used in ComfyUI for scaling images down without changing their aspect ratio?",
        "answer": "The `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI can be used for scaling images down by a specified factor without changing their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The return type of the `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, which in Python dtype is represented as `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the `ImageScaleDownBy` node in ComfyUI is `Art Venture/Utils`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `ImageScaleDownBy` class implemented in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `ImageScaleDownBy` class in ComfyUI is implemented by inheriting from the `UtilImageScaleDown` class, and it includes the method `image_scale_down_by` which calculates the new dimensions of the images based on the `scale_by` factor and scales them down."
