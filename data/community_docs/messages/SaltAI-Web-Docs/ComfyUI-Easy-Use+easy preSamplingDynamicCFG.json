        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node is designed to apply dynamic control flow graph (CFG) based pre-sampling techniques to adjust the sampling process dynamically based on specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pipe' input represent in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The 'pipe' input represents the pipeline through which the sampling process is executed, serving as the conduit for applying dynamic CFG adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'steps' input specify in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The 'steps' input specifies the number of steps in the sampling process, directly influencing the granularity of the dynamic CFG adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'cfg' input define in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The 'cfg' input defines the configuration for the dynamic CFG adjustments, setting the intensity and scope of the sampling modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the method of sampling within the dynamic CFG framework?",
        "answer": "The 'sampler_name' input identifies the specific sampler to be used, dictating the method of sampling within the dynamic CFG framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'denoise' input play in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The 'denoise' input sets the level of denoising to be applied, affecting the clarity and quality of the sampled output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'seed' input provide in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The 'seed' input provides a seed value for the sampling process, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the dynamic CFG adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output does the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node outputs the modified pipeline after applying dynamic CFG-based pre-sampling, reflecting the adjusted sampling parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes for the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are optional inputs in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node and how are they used?",
        "answer": "Optional inputs in the 'easy preSamplingDynamicCFG' node include 'image_to_latent' and 'latent'. 'image_to_latent' specifies an image to be converted into a latent representation for sampling, while 'latent' provides a latent representation to be used directly in the sampling process."
