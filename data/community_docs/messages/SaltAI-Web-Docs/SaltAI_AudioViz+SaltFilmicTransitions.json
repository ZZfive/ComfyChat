        "question": "What is the SaltFilmicTransitions node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltFilmicTransitions node in ComfyUI is designed to create visually appealing transitions between two sets of images, utilizing a variety of modes such as swipes and circle expansions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltFilmicTransitions node are `images_a`, `images_b`, `mode`, and `transition_frames`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images_a` input represent in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The `images_a` input represents the first set of images to transition from, serving as the starting point for the transition effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What controls the style of the transition in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input controls the style of the transition in the SaltFilmicTransitions node, specifying the visual effect used to blend the images, such as swipe directions or circle expansions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the duration of the transition effect determined in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The `transition_frames` input determines the duration and smoothness of the effect in the SaltFilmicTransitions node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input allows for finer visual tuning of the transition effect in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The `mask_blur_schedule` input, if provided, allows for finer visual tuning of the transition effect in the SaltFilmicTransitions node by controlling the blur intensity over the transition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` output represent in the SaltFilmicTransitions node?",
        "answer": "The `images` output of the SaltFilmicTransitions node represents the resulting set of images after applying the transition effect, blended according to the specified mode and parameters."
