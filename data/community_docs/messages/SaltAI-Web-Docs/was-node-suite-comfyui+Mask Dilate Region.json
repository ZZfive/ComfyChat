        "question": "What does the Mask Dilate Region node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Dilate Region node is designed to dilate regions within given masks, effectively expanding the areas of interest, in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Mask Dilate Region node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Mask Dilate Region node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Masking` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the extent of dilation in the Mask Dilate Region node?",
        "answer": "The `iterations` parameter controls the extent of dilation in the Mask Dilate Region node. It specifies the number of times the dilation operation is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `iterations` parameter influence in the Mask Dilate Region node?",
        "answer": "The `iterations` parameter influences the degree of expansion for the mask's regions in the Mask Dilate Region node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data type does the `masks` input parameter have in the Mask Dilate Region node?",
        "answer": "The `masks` input parameter in the Mask Dilate Region node has a Comfy dtype of `MASK` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Mask Dilate Region node expand the specified regions of the masks?",
        "answer": "The Mask Dilate Region node expands the specified regions of the masks by applying the dilation operation the number of times specified by the `iterations` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output generated by the Mask Dilate Region node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Mask Dilate Region node has a Comfy dtype of `MASK` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`, representing dilated masks."
