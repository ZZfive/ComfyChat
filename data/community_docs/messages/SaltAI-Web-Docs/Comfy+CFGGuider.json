        "question": "What is CFGGuider in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CFGGuider in ComfyUI is a custom node designed to guide the sampling process in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CFGGuider use to steer the generation process?",
        "answer": "CFGGuider uses conditioning inputs and a configurable control factor (cfg) to steer the generation process in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CFGGuider?",
        "answer": "The required input types for CFGGuider include: 'model' (generative model), 'positive' (conditioning input for desired attributes), 'negative' (conditioning input for undesired attributes), and 'cfg' (control factor for fine-grained control)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CFGGuider modulate the influence of conditioning inputs?",
        "answer": "CFGGuider modulates the influence of conditioning inputs using a floating-point value 'cfg', which adjusts the strength of conditional fine-grained control during the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CFGGuider?",
        "answer": "The output type of CFGGuider is a configured guider object (GUIDER) that encapsulates the logic and parameters for guiding the generative model's sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CFGGuider class provide?",
        "answer": "The CFGGuider class provides functionality to create a guider object for guiding the generative model's sampling process based on specified conditions and control parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'model' input in CFGGuider?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in CFGGuider serves as the foundation for the guidance process, determining the base behavior and capabilities of the guided sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CFGGuider enhance the generative model's output?",
        "answer": "CFGGuider enhances the generative model's output by allowing conditional fine-grained control through 'positive' and 'negative' conditioning inputs, steering the output towards desired attributes."
