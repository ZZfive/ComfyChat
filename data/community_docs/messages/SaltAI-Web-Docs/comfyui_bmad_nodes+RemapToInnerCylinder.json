        "question": "What is the RemapToInnerCylinder node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The RemapToInnerCylinder node in ComfyUI applies a cylindrical remapping to an image, simulating the effect of viewing the image as if it were wrapped around an inner cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the RemapToInnerCylinder node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapToInnerCylinder node belongs to the 'Bmad/CV/Transform' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RemapToInnerCylinder node are 'fov' (field of view) with Comfy dtype: 'INT' and 'swap_xy' with Comfy dtype: 'BOOLEAN'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the field of view applied in the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The field of view in the RemapToInnerCylinder node determines the curvature of the cylindrical projection and affects how the image is stretched or compressed to fit the cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'swap_xy' input in the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The 'swap_xy' input in the RemapToInnerCylinder node is a boolean flag that, when set to true, swaps the x and y axes of the image, altering the orientation of the cylindrical projection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and comfy dtype of the RemapToInnerCylinder node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the RemapToInnerCylinder node is 'remap' with a comfy dtype: 'REMAP', providing the transformed image as if viewed on the surface of an inner cylinder."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which infrastructure type does the RemapToInnerCylinder node run?",
        "answer": "The RemapToInnerCylinder node runs on the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
