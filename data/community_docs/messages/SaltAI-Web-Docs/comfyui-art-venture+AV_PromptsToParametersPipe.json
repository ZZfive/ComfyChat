        "question": "What is the purpose of the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node is designed to convert textual prompts into a structured parameters pipe, facilitating the integration of user-defined positive and negative prompts into a broader pipeline for art generation or modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node are the positive and negative prompts, which represent the desired and undesired attributes or elements to include or exclude from the art generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node include a structured data pipeline, an image, and a mask, which can be used to influence the art generation process or specify targeted modifications or enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node process the input prompts?",
        "answer": "The AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node processes the input prompts by enriching a structured parameters pipe with the provided positive and negative prompts, and optionally, image and mask data for tailored art generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node and in what format is it returned?",
        "answer": "The output of the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node is a structured parameters pipe enriched with the provided prompts and image or mask data, and it is returned in the form of a Dict with a Comfy dtype of PIPE."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, what node is used to convert textual prompts into structured parameters for art generation?",
        "answer": "The AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node is used in ComfyUI to convert textual prompts into structured parameters for art generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you specify which areas of an image to modify using the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can specify areas of an image to modify using the AV_PromptsToParametersPipe node in ComfyUI by providing an optional mask input."
