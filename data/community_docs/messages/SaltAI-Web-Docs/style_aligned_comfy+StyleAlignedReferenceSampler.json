        "question": "What is the StyleAlignedReferenceSampler node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The StyleAlignedReferenceSampler node is designed to sample reference styles in a manner that aligns with specific style guidelines or constraints, ensuring consistency and coherence in the style of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model' input specify in the StyleAlignedReferenceSampler node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input specifies the model to be used for sampling, ensuring that the generated styles align with the desired aesthetic or thematic guidelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of StyleAlignedReferenceSampler affects the consistency of style application?",
        "answer": "The 'share_norm' input of StyleAlignedReferenceSampler affects the consistency of style application by determining how normalization layers are shared across the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is attention influenced in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler?",
        "answer": "Attention is influenced in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler through the 'share_attn' input, which controls how attention layers are shared, affecting the focus and coherence of the generated styles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs allow for the control of style intensity and sampling efficiency in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler?",
        "answer": "The 'scale' input adjusts the scale of the applied style to control the intensity of style effects, and the 'batch_size' input specifies the number of samples processed in parallel to affect the efficiency of the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of StyleAlignedReferenceSampler, what is the purpose of 'ref_latents'?",
        "answer": "The 'ref_latents' input in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler allows for the alignment of the generated style to pre-existing latents to be used as a reference in the style sampling process, enabling more precise style alignment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sigmas' input in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler control?",
        "answer": "The 'sigmas' input in StyleAlignedReferenceSampler sets the noise levels for the sampling process, influencing the exploration of the style space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two outputs of the StyleAlignedReferenceSampler node?",
        "answer": "The StyleAlignedReferenceSampler node outputs two types: 'output', which provides the sampled latents according to the specified style guidelines, and 'denoised_output', which offers a denoised version of the sampled latents to enhance the clarity and quality of the generated styles."
