        "question": "What is the purpose of the SV3D_BatchSchedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SV3D_BatchSchedule node in ComfyUI is designed for scheduling azimuth and elevation conditions for SV3D, which is a video model by Stability AI. It allows users to define how the camera's azimuth and elevation should change over time, enhancing the generation of 3D videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used to specify the initial image for the video generation process in the SV3D_BatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'init_image' input specifies the initial image to start the video generation from, setting the visual context in the SV3D_BatchSchedule node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'vae' input in the SV3D_BatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' input in the SV3D_BatchSchedule node defines the VAE model used for encoding and decoding images, which is crucial for the video generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'interpolation' input affect the generation of video frames in SV3D_BatchSchedule?",
        "answer": "The 'interpolation' input in SV3D_BatchSchedule specifies the method of interpolation between keyframes, which affects the smoothness of the transition in generated video frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'azimuth_points_string' input control in the SV3D_BatchSchedule node?",
        "answer": "The 'azimuth_points_string' input in SV3D_BatchSchedule controls the horizontal rotation of the camera by defining key points for azimuth changes over the video timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used to schedule azimuth and elevation conditions for 3D video generation?",
        "answer": "The SV3D_BatchSchedule node in ComfyUI can be used for scheduling azimuth and elevation conditions, which is crucial for enhancing the generation of 3D videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output from the SV3D_BatchSchedule node influences the generation towards desired features?",
        "answer": "The positive conditioning output ('positive') from SV3D_BatchSchedule influences the generation towards desired features in ComfyUI."
