        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy globalSeed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy globalSeed node is designed to manage and control the seed value used across various nodes in a workflow, allowing for consistent or varied randomization effects based on user-defined actions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What operations can be performed on the seed value using the easy globalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The easy globalSeed node supports operations such as fixing, incrementing, decrementing, and randomizing the seed value, both globally and per node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines when the seed control should be applied in the easy globalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The mode input determines when the seed control should be applied, either before or after the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the last_seed input in the easy globalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The last_seed input optionally stores the last seed value used, facilitating tracking and reuse of seed values across sessions or nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the easy globalSeed node categorized within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy globalSeed node is categorized under EasyUse/Seed within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the easy globalSeed node suitable for?",
        "answer": "The easy globalSeed node is suitable for CPU infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the value input specify in the easy globalSeed node?",
        "answer": "The value input specifies the base seed value from which the seed management starts, serving as the foundation for subsequent operations like incrementing or randomizing."
