        "question": "What is the purpose of the CannyEdgePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CannyEdgePreprocessor node is designed for edge detection in images using the Canny algorithm. It preprocesses images by applying a Canny edge detector to highlight the edges within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category in ComfyUI does the CannyEdgePreprocessor node belong to?",
        "answer": "The CannyEdgePreprocessor node belongs to the category of `ControlNet Preprocessors/Line Extractors` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in CannyEdgePreprocessor sets the lower bound for the hysteresis thresholding step?",
        "answer": "The `low_threshold` parameter in CannyEdgePreprocessor sets the lower bound for the hysteresis thresholding step in the Canny edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `resolution` parameter in CannyEdgePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` parameter in CannyEdgePreprocessor specifies the resolution to which the input image will be resized before applying the Canny edge detection algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python dtype is associated with the input type `image` in CannyEdgePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The input type `image` in CannyEdgePreprocessor is associated with the Python dtype `numpy.ndarray`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can CannyEdgePreprocessor work with the PreviewImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CannyEdgePreprocessor can work with the PreviewImage node in ComfyUI, as this is one of the common nodes it can be used with for further image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the nature of the output from the CannyEdgePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output from the CannyEdgePreprocessor node is an image where the edges have been highlighted using the Canny edge detection algorithm. The Comfy dtype is `IMAGE`."
