    {
        "question": "What is the primary function of the PiDiNet Preprocessor node in image processing?",
        "answer": "The primary function of the PiDiNet Preprocessor node is to preprocess images to extract soft-edge lines using the PiDiNet model for enhanced line detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `image` input used in the PiDiNet Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input is the primary data on which the PiDiNet model operates. It is the input image to be processed for line extraction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for `image` input in ComfyUI and Python respectively?",
        "answer": "The `image` input has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does the `safe` mode have on the PiDiNet Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `safe` mode enables or disables safety checks during image processing, affecting the execution path and potentially the output quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of the `resolution` input on the output of the PiDiNet Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` input impacts the detail level of the extracted lines by resizing the input image to the specified resolution before processing."
