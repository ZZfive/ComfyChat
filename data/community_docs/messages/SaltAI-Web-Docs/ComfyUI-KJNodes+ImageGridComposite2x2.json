        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageGridComposite2x2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite2x2 node in ComfyUI is designed to concatenate four input images into a 2x2 grid, creating a composite image that effectively combines these inputs in a visually structured manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageGridComposite2x2 node?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite2x2 node requires four images as input: image1, image2, image3, and image4, which are respectively placed in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the 2x2 grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the ImageGridComposite2x2 node?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite2x2 node provides a single output, denoted as 'image', which is the composite image resulting from concatenating the four input images into a 2x2 grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for implementing the functionality of the ImageGridComposite2x2 node?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite2x2 functionality is implemented by the class `ImageGridComposite2x2`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input and output images for the ImageGridComposite2x2 node?",
        "answer": "The input and output images for the ImageGridComposite2x2 node have a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type used by the ImageGridComposite2x2 node?",
        "answer": "The infra type used by the ImageGridComposite2x2 node is `GPU`, indicating that it leverages the GPU infrastructure for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method does the ImageGridComposite2x2 node use to composite the images?",
        "answer": "The ImageGridComposite2x2 node uses the method `compositegrid` to composite the images by concatenating the top row and bottom row respectively, and then concatenating these two rows vertically to form the 2x2 grid."
