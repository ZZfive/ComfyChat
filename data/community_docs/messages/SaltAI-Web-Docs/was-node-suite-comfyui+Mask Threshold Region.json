        "question": "What is the purpose of the Mask Threshold Region node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Mask Threshold Region node in ComfyUI is used to apply a thresholding operation to a given mask or set of masks, segmenting the image into regions based on specified black and white threshold values to isolate and highlight areas within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the Mask Threshold Region node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Mask Threshold Region node is `Mask Threshold Region`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node type of the Mask Threshold Region node?",
        "answer": "The output node type of the Mask Threshold Region node is `False`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Mask Threshold Region node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Mask Threshold Region node are `masks`, which is of type `MASK` indicating `torch.Tensor`, and the thresholds `black_threshold` and `white_threshold` both of type `INT` or `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the influence of the 'masks' parameter on the Mask Threshold Region node's output?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' parameter in the Mask Threshold Region node is crucial as it determines which areas of the image are isolated based on the threshold values, directly influencing the output of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'black_threshold' input control in the Mask Threshold Region node?",
        "answer": "The 'black_threshold' input in the Mask Threshold Region node is the lower bound for the thresholding operation. Pixels with values below this threshold are set to black, contributing to the segmentation of the mask."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'white_threshold' input control in the Mask Threshold Region node?",
        "answer": "The 'white_threshold' input in the Mask Threshold Region node is the upper bound for the thresholding operation. Pixels with values above this threshold are set to white, further refining the segmentation of the mask."
