        "question": "What is the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node in ComfyUI is designed to manage a countdown mechanism within a queue system, triggering specific actions based on the countdown progress and conditional logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node are `count`, representing the current count in the countdown process; `total`, defining the total count for the countdown; and `mode`, a boolean flag that controls whether the countdown mechanism is active."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `signal` input in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The `signal` input in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is optional and can carry additional information or control signals through the node's operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node handle the updated `count` value after its operation?",
        "answer": "The ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node returns the updated `count` value after its operation, reflecting the countdown's progress."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what scenarios is the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node designed to reset the countdown?",
        "answer": "The ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is designed to reset the countdown when the current count (`count`) reaches one less than the total count (`total`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mode` input do in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is a boolean flag that, when set to True, activates the countdown mechanism, influencing the node's behavior to trigger actions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type classification of the `signal` input in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node?",
        "answer": "The `signal` input in the ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown node is classified with a Comfy dtype of `*` and a Python dtype of `object`, indicating it can accept any type of data."
