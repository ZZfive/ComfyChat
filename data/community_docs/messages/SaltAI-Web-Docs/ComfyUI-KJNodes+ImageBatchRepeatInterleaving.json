        "question": "What does the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node do?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node in the KJNodes/image category is designed to expand a batch of images by repeating each image a specified number of times, increasing the batch size through image duplication."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node process the input images?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node takes a batch of images and repeats each image within the batch by a specified number of times, effectively enlarging the batch size by duplicating images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node requires two types of inputs: 'images' which is a batch of input images of dtype IMAGE (torch.Tensor) and 'repeats' which is an integer specifying the number of times each image should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'images' input parameter in ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving expect?",
        "answer": "The 'images' input parameter in ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving expects a batch of images, with a Comfy dtype of IMAGE and a Python dtype of torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'repeats' parameter utilized in the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The 'repeats' parameter in ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving specifies the number of times each image in the batch should be repeated, directly influencing the resulting batch size by determining the duplication factor for each image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node is IMAGE, represented as a torch.Tensor in Python, which is a new batch of images where each original image has been repeated according to the 'repeats' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain how the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node affects a batch of images with repeats of 2?",
        "answer": "When using the ImageBatchRepeatInterleaving node with repeats of 2, a batch of 5 images will become a batch of 10 images, where each original image is repeated once to create duplicates."
