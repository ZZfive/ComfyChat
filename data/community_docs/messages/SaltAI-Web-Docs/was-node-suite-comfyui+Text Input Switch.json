        "question": "What is the Text Input Switch node designed to do within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Input Switch node is designed to selectively output one of two text inputs ('text_a' or 'text_b') based on a boolean condition. It serves as a logical switch within text processing workflows, enabling conditional text flow and decision-making in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Text Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Text Input Switch node include 'text_a' and 'text_b' which are text input options, and 'boolean', a condition that determines which text input is passed through as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the boolean input of the Text Input Switch node determine?",
        "answer": "The boolean input of the Text Input Switch node determines which of the two text inputs ('text_a' or 'text_b') is passed through as the output. If the boolean input is True, 'text_a' is outputted; if it's False, 'text_b' is outputted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Text Input Switch node and its type?",
        "answer": "The output of the Text Input Switch node is a selected text input based on the boolean condition. This output has the dtype 'STRING' in ComfyUI and its type is 'str' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type does the boolean input of the Text Input Switch correspond to?",
        "answer": "The boolean input of the Text Input Switch corresponds to the 'bool' data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, how does the Text Input Switch node utilize the boolean input for routing text?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the Text Input Switch node utilizes the boolean input to conditionally route either 'text_a' or 'text_b' as output, serving as a logical switch for text-based decision-making."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the source code, which class defines the functionality of the Text Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The functionality of the Text Input Switch node is defined by the class `WAS_Text_Input_Switch` in the source code provided."
