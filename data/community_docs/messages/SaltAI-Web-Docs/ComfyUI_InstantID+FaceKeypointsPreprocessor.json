        "question": "What is the purpose of the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images by extracting facial keypoints, which are essential for facial analysis tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is crucial for detecting faces within the image using the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'faceanalysis' input is crucial for detecting faces within the image using the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor. It represents a model that has been loaded and prepared for face analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'image' input in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input is the image to be processed by the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node. It is analyzed by the face analysis model to detect faces and extract keypoints."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node output, and what is its Comfy dtype?",
        "answer": "The FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node outputs an image with facial keypoints extracted. Its Comfy dtype is `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'image' input in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'image' input in the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node is `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no face is detected by the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "If no face is detected, the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node will output a zero-filled tensor of the same size as the input image and print a warning message."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node belong to in the ComfyUI interface?",
        "answer": "The FaceKeypointsPreprocessor node belongs to the 'InstantID' category in the ComfyUI interface."
