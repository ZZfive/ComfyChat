        "question": "What is the purpose of the LLMComplete node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMComplete node is designed to generate text completions based on a given prompt using a specified language model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the LLMComplete node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LLMComplete node belongs to the category `SALT/Language Toolkit/Querying` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LLMComplete node are `llm_model`, which specifies the language model to be used, and `prompt`, the input text prompt based on which the language model generates completions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `llm_model` parameter determine in the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The `llm_model` parameter determines the linguistic and knowledge capabilities of the generated text, as it specifies the language model to be used."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `prompt` input influence the output of the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The `prompt` input guides the model's output towards the desired context or question, influencing the text completion generated by the model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the LLMComplete node provide?",
        "answer": "The LLMComplete node provides the generated text completion based on the input prompt and the specified language model as a `STRING` output named `completion`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the inferred `python dtype` for the output of the LLMComplete node?",
        "answer": "The inferred `python dtype` for the output of the LLMComplete node is `str`, corresponding to the string text completion generated."
