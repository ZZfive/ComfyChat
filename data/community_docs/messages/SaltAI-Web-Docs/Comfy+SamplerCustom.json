        "question": "What is SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "SamplerCustom is a node in ComfyUI designed to provide a customizable sampling framework within a generative model pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SamplerCustom allow you to do?",
        "answer": "SamplerCustom allows integration of various sampling strategies and configurations to tailor the generation process according to specific requirements or preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SamplerCustom include 'model' (specifying the generative model), 'add_noise' (boolean to add noise), 'noise_seed' (integer seed for noise generation), 'cfg' (float controlling conditioning factor), 'positive' and 'negative' (conditioning specifications), 'sampler' (sampling strategy), 'sigmas' (list defining noise levels), and 'latent_image' (initial latent image)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SamplerCustom handle noise generation?",
        "answer": "SamplerCustom handles noise generation by optionally adding noise based on a boolean parameter 'add_noise' and using a specified seed 'noise_seed' to ensure consistency in noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "The output types of SamplerCustom include 'output' (latent representation of the generated content) and 'denoised_output' (denoised version of the generated content)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used with SamplerCustom include VAEDecode, Preview Chooser, and LatentUpscaleBy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'sample' method in SamplerCustom?",
        "answer": "The 'sample' method in SamplerCustom executes the sampling process using parameters such as the generative model, noise settings, conditioning factors, sampling strategy, and initial latent image."
