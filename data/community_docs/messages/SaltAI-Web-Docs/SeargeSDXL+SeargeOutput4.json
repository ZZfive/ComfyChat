        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeOutput4 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeOutput4 node in ComfyUI is designed to demultiplex model names and configurations for various components of a generative AI model, streamlining the process of selecting and configuring models for generation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SeargeOutput4 node include `model_names`, `base_model`, `refiner_model`, `vae_model`, `main_upscale_model`, `support_upscale_model`, and `lora_model`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `model_names` input in SeargeOutput4 specify?",
        "answer": "The `model_names` input in SeargeOutput4 specifies the names and configurations of various models involved in the generation process, such as the base, refiner, VAE, main upscale, support upscale, and Lora models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What models are identified by the SeargeOutput4 node?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput4 identifies the base model, refiner model, VAE model, main upscale model, support upscale model, and Lora model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SeargeOutput4 handle the base model?",
        "answer": "SeargeOutput4 identifies the base model for initial generation tasks and returns it as `base_model` with the dtype of `CHECKPOINT_NAME`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which dtype corresponds to the `lora_model` output of SeargeOutput4?",
        "answer": "The `lora_model` output of SeargeOutput4 has the dtype of `LORA_NAME`."
    },
