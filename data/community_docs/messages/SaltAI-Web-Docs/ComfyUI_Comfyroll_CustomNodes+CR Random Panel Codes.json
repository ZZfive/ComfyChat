        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Random Panel Codes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Random Panel Codes node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a series of unique codes based on specified parameters, including the number of rows, string length, and a set of values, which can serve various purposes such as unique identifiers or access codes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `seed` parameter used for in the CR Random Panel Codes node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` parameter in the CR Random Panel Codes node is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the sequence of generated codes is reproducible when the same seed is used across different runs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `rows` input parameter control in the CR Random Panel Codes node?",
        "answer": "The `rows` input parameter in the CR Random Panel Codes node specifies the number of codes to generate, thereby directly influencing the output's length and allowing for customization based on the required number of unique codes."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `string_length` input parameter function in the CR Random Panel Codes node?",
        "answer": "The `string_length` input parameter in the CR Random Panel Codes node determines the length of the numeric part of each code, thus controlling the granularity and potential uniqueness of each generated code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `values` input represent in the CR Random Panel Codes node?",
        "answer": "The `values` input in the CR Random Panel Codes node is a string containing characters that can be used in the generation of the codes, allowing for customization of the code format by specifying the allowable characters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output format of the CR Random Panel Codes node in terms of the generated codes?",
        "answer": "The output format of the CR Random Panel Codes node is a string containing the generated codes, with each code on a new line, which is useful for applications requiring a list of unique identifiers or access codes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What additional resource is provided by the CR Random Panel Codes node to help users understand its use?",
        "answer": "The CR Random Panel Codes node provides a URL in its `show_help` output that gives access to additional documentation and help for users to effectively use the node."
