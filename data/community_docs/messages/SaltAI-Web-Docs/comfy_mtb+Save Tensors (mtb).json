        "question": "What is the Save Tensors (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Save Tensors (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed for saving torch tensors, such as images, masks, or latent representations, to disk, which is particularly useful for debugging outside of the Comfy environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the 'image' input type in the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the 'image' input type in the Save Tensors (mtb) node is 'IMAGE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'filename_prefix' parameter help in the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'filename_prefix' parameter in the Save Tensors (mtb) node helps in organizing and identifying saved tensors for debugging purposes by specifying the prefix for the filename under which the tensor will be saved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Save Tensors (mtb) node doesn't have output types."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'mask' input type in the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'mask' input type in the Save Tensors (mtb) node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'latent' input type play in the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'latent' input type in the Save Tensors (mtb) node is an optional latent tensor that can be saved to disk, facilitating the debugging and examination of latent representations in models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of saving torch tensors using the Save Tensors (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of saving torch tensors using the Save Tensors (mtb) node is to enable the inspection and analysis of tensor data generated within custom workflows outside of the Comfy environment, particularly useful for debugging."
