        "question": "What is the JWFloatMin node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMin node in ComfyUI is used to calculate the minimum of two floating-point numbers, providing a simple yet essential mathematical operation for numerical data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the JWFloatMin node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMin node belongs to the `jamesWalker55` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'a' input in the JWFloatMin node?",
        "answer": "The 'a' input in the JWFloatMin node represents the first floating-point number to compare. It plays a crucial role in determining the minimum value when compared with the second number."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for input 'a' and 'b' in the JWFloatMin node?",
        "answer": "The data types for input 'a' and 'b' in the JWFloatMin node are `FLOAT` in ComfyUI and `float` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the JWFloatMin node?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWFloatMin node is the minimum value between the two input floating-point numbers. The data type is `FLOAT` in ComfyUI and `float` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infrastructure type is the JWFloatMin node optimized for?",
        "answer": "The JWFloatMin node is optimized for the `CPU` infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWFloatMin node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWFloatMin node is not an output node."
