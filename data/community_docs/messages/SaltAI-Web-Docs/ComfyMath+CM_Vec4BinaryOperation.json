        "question": "What is CM_Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4BinaryOperation is a node in ComfyUI that performs binary operations on two 4-dimensional vectors (Vec4), producing a new Vec4 as the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec4BinaryOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4BinaryOperation belongs to the 'math/vec4' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does CM_Vec4BinaryOperation abstract?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4BinaryOperation abstracts complex vector arithmetic into simple, high-level operations, making vector space manipulations easier."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs are required for CM_Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4BinaryOperation requires 'op', 'a', and 'b' as inputs. 'op' specifies the binary operation to perform, while 'a' and 'b' are 4-dimensional vectors (Vec4) acting as operands."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does CM_Vec4BinaryOperation produce?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4BinaryOperation produces a 'VEC4' output, which is the result of the binary operation on the input Vec4 vectors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for 'op' in CM_Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "In Python, 'op' for CM_Vec4BinaryOperation is of type 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the output of CM_Vec4BinaryOperation?",
        "answer": "The output of CM_Vec4BinaryOperation in Python is of type 'Vec4'."
