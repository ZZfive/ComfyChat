        "question": "What is the SaltAudioDeesser node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioDeesser node in ComfyUI is designed to reduce sibilance in audio recordings through a de-essing process, applying an audio filter to attenuate the intensity of sibilant consonants."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type is crucial for the SaltAudioDeesser node's de-essing operation?",
        "answer": "The crucial input type for the SaltAudioDeesser node's de-essing operation is `audio`, which is the raw audio data targeted for sibilance reduction."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the intensity level for the SaltAudioDeesser node's de-essing effect controlled?",
        "answer": "The intensity level for the SaltAudioDeesser node's de-essing effect is controlled by the `intensity` input, which defines the threshold level for how aggressively sibilance is reduced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the frequency range preserved from the de-essing process by the SaltAudioDeesser node?",
        "answer": "The frequency range preserved from the de-essing process by the SaltAudioDeesser node is determined by the `frequency_keep` input, ensuring important audio characteristics remain intact during de-essing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SaltAudioDeesser node output after processing?",
        "answer": "After processing, the SaltAudioDeesser node outputs `audio`, which is the processed audio data with reduced sibilance, formatted as bytes for ComfyUI's `AUDIO` type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can help reduce the intensity of sibilant consonants in audio recordings?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioDeesser node can help reduce the intensity of sibilant consonants in audio recordings by applying a de-essing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure is required for the SaltAudioDeesser node to operate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltAudioDeesser node requires a CPU infrastructure to operate within ComfyUI."
