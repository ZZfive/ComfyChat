        "question": "What is StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet?",
        "answer": "StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for generating super-resolution control inputs using a VAE to encode images into latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet belong to?",
        "answer": "StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet belongs to the `_for_testing/stable_cascade` category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet?",
        "answer": "StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet requires inputs of type `IMAGE` for the input image and type `VAE` for the variational autoencoder model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `controlnet_input` output represent?",
        "answer": "`controlnet_input` represents the encoded latent representation of the input image, prepared for the control network of the super-resolution process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `stage_c` output represent?",
        "answer": "`stage_c` represents a latent representation tailored for the initial stage of the super-resolution process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `stage_b` output represent?",
        "answer": "`stage_b` represents a latent representation tailored for the subsequent stage of the super-resolution process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What function does StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet perform?",
        "answer": "StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet performs the function `generate`, which processes an input image and a VAE model to produce encoded latent representations for super-resolution control."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet?",
        "answer": "StableCascade_SuperResolutionControlnet is recommended to run on `GPU` infrastructure."
