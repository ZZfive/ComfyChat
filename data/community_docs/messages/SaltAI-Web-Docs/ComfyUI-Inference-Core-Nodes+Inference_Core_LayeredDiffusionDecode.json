        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node in ComfyUI is designed to decode layered diffusion processes, effectively translating sampled data into images through a series of diffusion steps using advanced techniques for optimized high-quality image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is necessary to begin the process of LayeredDiffusionDecode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LayeredDiffusionDecode node in ComfyUI requires sampled data, represented initially as `samples`, to be decoded into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `images` input parameter represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node?",
        "answer": "The `images` input parameter is a tensor of images to be processed through diffusion steps to serve as the basis for the decoding operation in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node determines the diffusion model version?",
        "answer": "The `sd_version` parameter in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node specifies the version of the diffusion model to be used, influencing decoding behavior and output image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does `sub_batch_size` play in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node?",
        "answer": "The `sub_batch_size` parameter in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node determines the size of sub-batches for processing, which optimizes computational efficiency and resource usage during operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode` node output in terms of images?",
        "answer": "The `Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode` node outputs images decoded from diffusion processes, primarily in the form of a torch.Tensor of `IMAGE` type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node provide to indicate the transparency of decoded images?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecode node provides an output of type `MASK` to indicate the transparency of the decoded images by supplying an alpha mask."
