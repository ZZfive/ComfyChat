        "question": "What is the class name for the Ambient Occlusion effect in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Ambient Occlusion effect in ComfyUI is `Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion)`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node belongs to the category `WAS Suite/Image/Filter`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the Ambient Occlusion effect in the context of image processing?",
        "answer": "The Ambient Occlusion effect enhances the realism of images by simulating the way light interacts with objects in a scene, focusing on areas where objects block ambient light to create soft shadows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes are used as inputs to the Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node for processing images with ambient occlusion effects?",
        "answer": "The Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node requires images and corresponding depth images as inputs for processing ambient occlusion effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the strength parameter influence the Ambient Occlusion effect?",
        "answer": "The strength parameter controls the intensity of the ambient occlusion effect, with higher values resulting in more pronounced shadows, adding greater depth and contrast to the scene."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the radius parameter play in the Ambient Occlusion effect?",
        "answer": "The radius parameter determines the spread of the ambient occlusion effect, with a larger radius simulating a softer, more diffuse shadow, contributing to a more natural and realistic appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node?",
        "answer": "The Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion) node generates `composited_images`, `ssao_images`, and `specular_mask_images` as outputs."
