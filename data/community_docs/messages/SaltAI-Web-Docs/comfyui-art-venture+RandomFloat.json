        "question": "What does the RandomFloat node generate?",
        "answer": "The RandomFloat node generates a random floating-point number within a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The RandomFloat node requires two input types: `min` and `max`. `min` specifies the minimum value in the range from which the random float will be generated, and `max` defines the maximum value in the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the RandomFloat node represented?",
        "answer": "The output of the RandomFloat node is represented by a random floating-point number (dtype: `FLOAT`) and its string representation (dtype: `STRING`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the inputs and outputs of the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types for `min` and `max` inputs are `float`, and the Python data types for the output are `float` for the random floating-point number and `str` for its string representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for the RandomFloat node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class and method is used to implement the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The RandomFloat node is implemented using the `UtilRandomFloat` class and the `random_float` method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the random number generated in the RandomFloat node?",
        "answer": "The random number in the RandomFloat node is generated by multiplying the result of `torch.rand(1).item()` by the difference between `max` and `min` and adding `min`."
