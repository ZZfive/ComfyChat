        "question": "What is RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "RepeatLatentBatch is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to replicate a given batch of latent representations a specified number of times, potentially including additional data like noise masks and batch indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "The class name of RepeatLatentBatch is `RepeatLatentBatch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does RepeatLatentBatch belong to?",
        "answer": "RepeatLatentBatch belongs to the category `latent/batch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the samples input parameter represent in RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter in RepeatLatentBatch represents the latent representations to be replicated. It defines the data that will undergo repetition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the amount input parameter accept in RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "The 'amount' parameter in RepeatLatentBatch accepts an integer (`INT`) specifying the number of times the input samples should be repeated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "The output type of RepeatLatentBatch is `LATENT`, which is a modified version of the input latent representations, replicated according to the specified 'amount'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function performed by RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "The function performed by RepeatLatentBatch is 'repeat', which replicates the input latent representations according to the specified 'amount'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infra is recommended for using RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "RepeatLatentBatch is recommended to be used with infra type `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes used with RepeatLatentBatch?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used with RepeatLatentBatch include KSamplerAdvanced."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does RepeatLatentBatch handle noise masks?",
        "answer": "RepeatLatentBatch handles noise masks by replicating them along with the latent representations if they are present in the input."
