        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Overlay Transparent Image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Overlay Transparent Image node in ComfyUI is designed to overlay a transparent image onto a background image, allowing adjustments in transparency, position, rotation, and scale of the overlay image to create composite images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What node can be used in ComfyUI to overlay transparent images onto a background?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the CR Overlay Transparent Image node can be used to overlay transparent images onto a background with the ability to adjust transparency, position, rotation, and scale."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input controls the opacity of the overlay image in the CR Overlay Transparent Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'transparency' input in the CR Overlay Transparent Image node controls the opacity of the overlay image, adjusting how visible it is against the background image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the horizontal offset of the overlay image in ComfyUI's CR Overlay Transparent Image node?",
        "answer": "The 'offset_x' input in the CR Overlay Transparent Image node determines the horizontal offset from the center of the background where the overlay image will be placed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the overlay image's rotation angle controlled in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The rotation angle of the overlay image in ComfyUI is controlled by the 'rotation_angle' input, which adjusts the angle in degrees to rotate the image for dynamic positioning and orientation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the CR Overlay Transparent Image node produce in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Overlay Transparent Image node in ComfyUI outputs the resulting image as 'image', which is the composite image after overlaying the transparent image onto the background with all specified transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the CR Overlay Transparent Image node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Overlay Transparent Image node in ComfyUI is recommended to be run on 'GPU' infrastructure for optimal performance."
