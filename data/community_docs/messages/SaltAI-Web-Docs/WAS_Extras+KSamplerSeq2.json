        "question": "What class does KSamplerSeq2 belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "KSamplerSeq2 is a class that belongs to the sampling category in ComfyUI, designed for advanced sequence sampling in generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input types are required for the KSamplerSeq2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the KSamplerSeq2 node include `model`, `seed`, `seed_mode_seq`, `alternate_values`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, `frame_count`, `cond_keyframes`, `positive_seq`, `negative_seq`, `use_conditioning_slerp`, `cond_slerp_strength`, `latent_image`, `use_latent_interpolation`, `latent_interpolation_mode`, `latent_interp_strength`, `denoise_start`, `denoise_seq`, `unsample_latents`, `inject_noise`, `noise_strength`, `denoise_sine`, `denoise_max`, `seed_keying`, `seed_keying_mode`, and `seed_divisor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `latent_image` input type represent in the context of KSamplerSeq2?",
        "answer": "The `latent_image` input type in KSamplerSeq2 provides the initial latent image to start the sampling process from."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the KSamplerSeq2 node output and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerSeq2 node outputs a latent representation of the generated sequence (`latent`), which has a Comfy dtype of `LATENT` and a Python dtype of `object`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of KSamplerSeq2, what is the purpose of the `latent_interpolation_mode` input?",
        "answer": "The `latent_interpolation_mode` input in KSamplerSeq2 determines the mode of latent interpolation, such as blending, spherical linear interpolation, or cosine interpolation, between steps during the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does KSamplerSeq2 handle seed progression throughout the sequence?",
        "answer": "KSamplerSeq2 handles seed progression throughout the sequence by allowing the 'seed_mode_seq' input to define the mode, be it incremental, decremental, random, or fixed seed values, guiding the sequence sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `sampler_name` input determine in the KSamplerSeq2 node?",
        "answer": "The `sampler_name` input in the KSamplerSeq2 node selects the specific sampler algorithm to be used throughout the sequence generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input controls whether conditioning sequences use spherical linear interpolation in KSamplerSeq2?",
        "answer": "In KSamplerSeq2, the `use_conditioning_slerp` input enables or disables the use of spherical linear interpolation for conditioning sequences over the sequence."
