        "question": "What is the CR VAE Decode node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR VAE Decode node in ComfyUI is used to decode latent representations into images using a specified VAE model, supporting circular and tiled decoding modes to enhance visual characteristics of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' input parameter represent in the CR VAE Decode node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' input parameter represents the latent representations that are to be decoded into images, determining the visual content of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the CR VAE Decode node is responsible for selecting the VAE model for decoding?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter is responsible for specifying the VAE model used for decoding the latent representations into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what circumstances would you set the 'tiled' parameter to `True` in the CR VAE Decode node?",
        "answer": "The 'tiled' parameter would be set to `True` when you need to generate larger images while avoiding memory constraints, as it allows for tiling during the decoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does enabling the 'circular' parameter have on the images generated by the CR VAE Decode node?",
        "answer": "Enabling the 'circular' parameter in the CR VAE Decode node enables circular padding mode in convolutional layers of the VAE model, which enhances the visual quality of the output images by avoiding edge artifacts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types are used in ComfyUI for the 'samples', 'tiled', and 'circular' parameters of the CR VAE Decode node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' parameter uses the Comfy dtype `LATENT` and Python dtype `torch.Tensor`; the 'tiled' and 'circular' parameters both use the Comfy dtype `BOOLEAN` and Python dtype `bool`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the CR VAE Decode node provide, and what is its corresponding Comfy dtype and Python dtype?",
        "answer": "The CR VAE Decode node provides an output image of dtype 'IMAGE' in ComfyUI terms, which is represented by the Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
