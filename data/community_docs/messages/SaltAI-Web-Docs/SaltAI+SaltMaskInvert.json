        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltMaskInvert node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskInvert node in ComfyUI is designed to invert the pixel values of mask regions, effectively flipping the mask's foreground and background. This operation is fundamental in image processing tasks where the focus is on the inverse of the given regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by SaltMaskInvert in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltMaskInvert requires 'masks' as an input type, which is crucial for the inversion process and directly influences which areas of the mask will be flipped."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is used to invert the pixel values of mask regions?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskInvert node is used to invert the pixel values of mask regions in ComftyUI, effectively flipping the mask's foreground and background."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SaltMaskInvert node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SaltMaskInvert node is a MASK, which represents the inverted masks with pixel values flipped from the original input."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what type of processing is the SaltMaskInvert node specifically designed?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskInvert node is specifically designed for image processing tasks where inverting mask regions is required."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltMaskInvert node found in the ComfyUI interface?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskInvert node is found in the 'SALT/Masking/Filter' category of the ComfyUI interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the return type of the SaltMaskInvert node's function add_masks?",
        "answer": "The return type of the SaltMaskInvert node's function add_masks is a MASK, which represents the inverted masks with pixel values flipped from the original input."
