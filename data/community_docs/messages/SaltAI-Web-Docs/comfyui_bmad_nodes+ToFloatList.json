        "question": "What is the purpose of the ToFloatList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToFloatList node in ComfyUI is designed to aggregate individual float values into a list, facilitating operations that require collective processing or manipulation of multiple float entries."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the ToFloatList node belong in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ToFloatList node belongs to the category `Bmad/Lists/Make or Intercalate` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ToFloatList node is `FLOAT`, which is a list composed of the aggregated float inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `inputs_len` parameter specify in the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The `inputs_len` parameter in the ToFloatList node specifies the number of float inputs to be aggregated into the list, determining the size of the resulting float list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the python dtype of the input `inputs_len` in the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The python dtype of the input `inputs_len` in the ToFloatList node is `int`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the python dtype of the output in the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The python dtype of the output in the ToFloatList node is `List[float]`, representing a list of float values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the ToFloatList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the ToFloatList node is `CPU`."
