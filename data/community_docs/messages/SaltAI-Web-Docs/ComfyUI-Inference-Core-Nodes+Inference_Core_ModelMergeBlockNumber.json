        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node is used for merging two models by blending their components based on specified blending ratios, allowing for the creation of hybrid models that leverage strengths from both inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node belongs to the 'advanced/model_merging' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'model1' input in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'model1' input in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node represents the first model to be merged, serving as the base model onto which elements from the second model are blended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'time_embed.' input in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The 'time_embed.' input in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node specifies the blending ratio for the time embedding components of the models being merged."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many 'input_blocks.i.' inputs does the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node have, and what do they control?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node has 12 'input_blocks.i.' inputs, which specify the blending ratio for the i-th input block of the models, with the index i ranging from 0 to 11."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node produce, and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node produces a single output of type 'model', representing the merged model, which is a hybrid of the two input models with components blended according to the specified ratios."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the infra type and common nodes associated with the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the Inference_Core_ModelMergeBlockNumber node is 'GPU', and there are no specified common nodes associated with it."
