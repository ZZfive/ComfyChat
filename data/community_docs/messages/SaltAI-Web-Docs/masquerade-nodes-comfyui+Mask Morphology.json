        "question": "What is the 'Mask Morphology' node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Morphology' node in ComfyUI is used for altering the shape of masks through morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, which allows for the refinement or modification of mask boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the node that alters mask shapes in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the node that alters mask shapes in ComfyUI is `Mask Morphology`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the 'Mask Morphology' node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Morphology' node belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of morphological operations can the 'Mask Morphology' node perform on masks?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Morphology' node can perform dilation, erosion, opening, and closing operations on masks to alter their shape."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'image' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node?",
        "answer": "The 'image' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node represents the mask to be processed, which is the primary input for morphological transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'distance' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node affect the output?",
        "answer": "The 'distance' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node specifies the extent of the morphological operation, influencing how much the mask expands or contracts during processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the available operations that can be selected with the 'op' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node?",
        "answer": "The available operations that can be selected with the 'op' parameter in the 'Mask Morphology' node are 'dilate', 'erode', 'open', and 'close'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the 'Mask Morphology' node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask Morphology' node outputs a modified mask, which is the result of the applied morphological operation, reflecting changes in the mask's shape and boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the output from the 'Mask Morphology' node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The data type of the output from the 'Mask Morphology' node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE`, represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where does the morphological operations supported by the 'Mask Morphology' node take place?",
        "answer": "The morphological operations supported by the 'Mask Morphology' node take place primarily on the GPU, as indicated by the infra type 'GPU'."
