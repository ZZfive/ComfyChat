        "question": "What is the purpose of the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node in ComfyUI is designed to selectively retrieve images from a given batch based on specified indices, creating a new batch that includes only those images at the given positions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node are `images` (a batch of images to select from) and `indexes` (a string specifying the indices of the images to select)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node and how is it represented?",
        "answer": "The output of the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node is a batch of the selected images at the specified indices, which is represented as an `IMAGE` type in ComfyUI, and as a `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `indexes` input in the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node work?",
        "answer": "The `indexes` input in the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node is a string that specifies the indices of the images to select from the batch, allowing for the flexible selection of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of ComfyUI, what does the `GetImagesFromBatchIndexed` node do when using the `indexes` input?",
        "answer": "When using the `indexes` input, the `GetImagesFromBatchIndexed` node selects images from a batch based on the specified indices and returns those images as a new batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node formatted in terms of data types?",
        "answer": "The output of the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node is formatted as an `IMAGE` in ComfyUI and as a `torch.Tensor` in Python, representing the selected images at the specified indices."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that the GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node performs on image batches in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The GetImagesFromBatchIndexed node performs the function of selecting images from a batch based on specified indices, returning the images as a new batch."
