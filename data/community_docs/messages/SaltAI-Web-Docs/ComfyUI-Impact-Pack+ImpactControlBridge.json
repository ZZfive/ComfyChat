        "question": "What is the ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ImpactControlBridge is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to dynamically manage the state of other nodes. It enables activation, muting, or bypassing of specified nodes, facilitating flexible workflow adjustments and error handling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the ImpactControlBridge node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node belongs to the class `ImpactControlBridge` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node is categorized under `ImpactPack/Logic/_for_test` within the ComfyUI environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the ImpactControlBridge node?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node requires three inputs: `value`, `mode`, and `behavior`. `value` represents the input data for processing, `mode` determines the operational mode such as active, mute, or bypass, and `behavior` specifies additional control over the workflow like muting or bypassing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `value` input of the ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The `value` input of the ImpactControlBridge node represents the value to be processed by the node, which can influence the decision-making process of the control bridge."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI handle muting or bypassing?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node in ComfyUI handles muting or bypassing through the `behavior` input, which allows additional control over workflow adjustments by specifying whether the node should mute or bypass other nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What signals does the ImpactControlBridge node use during its operations in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactControlBridge node uses signals to manage state changes. When needing to activate or mute nodes, it sends `IMPACT-PACK-SIGNAL: STOP CONTROL BRIDGE` to ensure operational adjustments or raise exceptions for outdated components, such as ComfyUI-Manager."
