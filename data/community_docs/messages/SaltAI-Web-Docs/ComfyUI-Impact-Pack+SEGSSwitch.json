        "question": "What is the SEGSSwitch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSSwitch node in ComfyUI is used to dynamically select between multiple segmentation (SEGS) inputs based on a specified index, facilitating conditional processing paths within a pipeline and allowing for the flexible use of different segmentation data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SEGSSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SEGSSwitch node is `SEGSSwitch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SEGSSwitch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SEGSSwitch node belongs to the `ImpactPack/Util` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `select` input play in the SEGSSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The `select` input in the SEGSSwitch node specifies the index of the segmentation input to select, determining which segmentation data is used for processing and enabling dynamic choice based on conditions or preferences."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type for the `select` input in the SEGSSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The data type for the `select` input in the SEGSSwitch node is `INT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SEGSSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the SEGSSwitch node include `selected_value`, `selected_label`, and `selected_index`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `selected_label` output represent in the SEGSSwitch node?",
        "answer": "The `selected_label` output in the SEGSSwitch node represents a string value that corresponds to the label of the selected input, providing a descriptive identifier for the chosen segmentation data."
