        "question": "What is ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd?",
        "answer": "ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd is a custom node in Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì that allows the adjustment of individual attention and positional encoding weights by addition, enabling fine-tuned control over the animation diffusion process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `pe_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd represent?",
        "answer": "The `pe_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd specifies the addition value for positional encoding weights, which influences the spatial aspect of the generated animations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `attn_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd?",
        "answer": "The `attn_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd determines the addition value for the overall attention weights, affecting the focus and relevance of elements within the animation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `other_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd function?",
        "answer": "The `other_ADD` input in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd applies an addition adjustment to other unspecified weights, offering a generic mechanism for weight modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `print_adjustment` input play in ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd?",
