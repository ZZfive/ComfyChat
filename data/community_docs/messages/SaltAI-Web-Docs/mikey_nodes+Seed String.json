        "question": "What is the Seed String node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed String node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a numerical seed value into its string representation, enhancing compatibility and ease of integration with various systems or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Seed String node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Seed String node belongs to the 'Mikey/Utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input does the Seed String node require?",
        "answer": "The Seed String node requires a numerical seed value as input, which is specified as an 'INT' type in ComfyUI and 'int' in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of the seed input for the Seed String node?",
        "answer": "The range of the seed input for the Seed String node is from 0 to 0xffffffffffffffff."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Seed String node?",
        "answer": "The Seed String node outputs the original numerical seed value as 'INT' and the string representation of the input seed as 'STRING' type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types for the input and output of the Seed String node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types for the input of the Seed String node are 'int', and for the output, they are 'int' for the seed and 'str' for the seed_string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Seed String node in terms of seed usage?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Seed String node is to facilitate the use of the seed in contexts where a string format is required, ensuring consistent results across different executions or for seeding random number generators in a predictable manner."
