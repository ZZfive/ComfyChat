        "question": "What is the VHS_SplitImages node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitImages node in ComfyUI is used to divide a batch of images into two groups based on a specified index, which is crucial for workflows requiring the separation of image data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters does the VHS_SplitImages node require?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitImages node requires the 'images' parameter, representing the batch of images to be split, and the 'split_index' parameter, specifying the index at which the batch is split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data do the 'images' and 'split_index' parameters accept in VHS_SplitImages?",
        "answer": "The 'images' parameter in VHS_SplitImages accepts data of type 'torch.Tensor' (Comfy dtype: IMAGE), and the 'split_index' parameter accepts data of type 'int' (Comfy dtype: INT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What outputs does the VHS_SplitImages node provide?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitImages node provides outputs including the first group of images ('IMAGE_A') and its count ('A_count'), as well as the second group of images ('IMAGE_B') and its count ('B_count')."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the VHS_SplitImages node fall under within the ComfyUI interface?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SplitImages node falls under the 'Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/image' category within the ComfyUI interface."
    },
    {
