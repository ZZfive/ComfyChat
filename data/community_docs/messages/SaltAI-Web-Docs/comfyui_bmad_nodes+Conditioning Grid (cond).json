        "question": "What is the Conditioning Grid (cond) node in ComfyUI designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Grid (cond) node in ComfyUI is designed to apply conditioning to a grid structure, enabling customization of content generation based on specific grid coordinates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Conditioning Grid (cond) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Grid (cond) node belongs to the `Bmad/conditioning` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input determines the horizontal dimension of the grid in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node?",
        "answer": "The `columns` input, with a Comfy datatype of `INT` and a Python datatype of `int`, determines the horizontal dimension of the grid in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input affects the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied in the vertical direction?",
        "answer": "The `height` input, with a Comfy datatype of `INT` and a Python datatype of `int`, affects the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied in the vertical direction in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `strength` input in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node?",
        "answer": "The `strength` input, with a Comfy datatype of `FLOAT` and a Python datatype of `float`, determines the intensity of the conditioning effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the generated contentâ€™s characteristics in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `base` input represent in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node?",
        "answer": "The `base` input in the Conditioning Grid (cond) node represents the base conditioning that serves as the starting point for further modifications, crucial for establishing the initial context or theme of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Conditioning Grid (cond) node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Conditioning Grid (cond) node is `CONDITIONING`, representing the conditioned output and modified grid structure with applied conditioning."
