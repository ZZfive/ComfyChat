        "question": "What is the CustomSigmas node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The CustomSigmas node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a list of float values into a tensor of sigmas, facilitating the manipulation and application of these values in noise-related operations within neural network models."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the CustomSigmas node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CustomSigmas node belongs to the 'KJNodes/noise' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the sigmas_string input in the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The sigmas_string input represents a string of comma-separated sigma values intended to be converted into a tensor of sigmas. It is crucial for defining the specific sigma values to be used in subsequent operations, directly influencing the behavior and outcome of the noise application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the interpolate_to_steps parameter used for in the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The interpolate_to_steps parameter specifies the number of steps to which the sigma values should be interpolated. This parameter is essential for adjusting the length of the sigma tensor to match the desired number of steps in the model's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CustomSigmas node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CustomSigmas node is a tensor of sigmas derived from the input list of float values. This tensor is essential for noise manipulation and application processes in neural network models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the CustomSigmas node's source code?",
        "answer": "The source code of the CustomSigmas node defines the functionality to create a sigmas tensor from a string of comma-separated values, and it includes methods for log-linear interpolation if the number of sigma steps needs to be adjusted."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the CustomSigmas node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the CustomSigmas node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
