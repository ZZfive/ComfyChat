        "question": "What is the CR Conditioning Mixer node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Conditioning Mixer node is designed to blend or combine different conditioning inputs into a single, cohesive output, supporting various mixing methods such as combining, averaging, or concatenating conditioning inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first required input type for the CR Conditioning Mixer node?",
        "answer": "The first required input type for the CR Conditioning Mixer node is `conditioning_1`, which is the first set of conditioning inputs to be mixed and serves as a base or starting point for the mixing process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python dtypes for the `conditioning_1` and `conditioning_2` inputs of the CR Conditioning Mixer?",
        "answer": "The Python dtypes for the `conditioning_1` and `conditioning_2` inputs of the CR Conditioning Mixer are `List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mix_method` input determine in the CR Conditioning Mixer node?",
        "answer": "The `mix_method` input determines the method used for mixing the conditioning inputs, affecting how the inputs are blended together, offering options like 'Combine', 'Average', or 'Concatenate'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the average_strength used in the CR Conditioning Mixer node?",
        "answer": "The `average_strength` determines the strength or weight of the second set of conditioning inputs when using the 'Average' mixing method, controlling the balance between the two sets of inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node is associated with the `KSampler` in the context of ComfyUI and how does it relate to CR Conditioning Mixer?",
        "answer": "The `KSampler` node is associated with the CR Conditioning Mixer in ComfyUI as it is listed among common nodes in the documentation, suggesting potential use cases or compatibility with the CR Conditioning Mixer node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and dtype of the `CONDITIONING` output from the CR Conditioning Mixer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the `CONDITIONING` output from the CR Conditioning Mixer node is `CONDITIONING` with the Python dtype `List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `show_help` output provide in the CR Conditioning Mixer node?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output provides a URL to a help page with more information about the CR Conditioning Mixer node and its usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the mixing methods supported by the CR Conditioning Mixer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Conditioning Mixer node in ComfyUI supports mixing methods such as 'Combine', 'Average', and 'Concatenate'."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the CR Conditioning Mixer node located within the ComfyUI node system?",
        "answer": "The CR Conditioning Mixer node is located within the category `ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/âœ¨ Essential/ðŸ“¦ Core` in the ComfyUI node system."
