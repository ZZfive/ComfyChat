        "question": "What is the BboxDetectorSEGS node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorSEGS node is designed to detect bounding boxes around objects within images, leveraging segmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy and detail of the detection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the categories of input types required for the BboxDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The categories of input types required for the BboxDetectorSEGS node include the bounding box detector model (`bbox_detector`), image (`image`), threshold for bounding box detection (`threshold`), dilation applied to the detected bounding boxes (`dilation`), crop factor (`crop_factor`), minimum size for detected objects (`drop_size`), and optional labels to filter detected objects (`labels`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the dilation input parameter specify for the BboxDetectorSEGS?",
        "answer": "The dilation input parameter specifies the dilation applied to the detected bounding boxes, allowing for adjustments in the size of the bounding area around detected objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the BboxDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the BboxDetectorSEGS node include `segs`, which provides segmentation information derived from the detected bounding boxes, offering detailed insights into the objects' shapes and boundaries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `threshold` input parameter play in the BboxDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `threshold` input parameter serves as a threshold value for bounding box detection, determining the sensitivity of the detector to potential objects within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `labels` input in the BboxDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `labels` input in the BboxDetectorSEGS node provides an optional set of labels to filter the detected objects, allowing for selective segmentation based on specified categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `crop_factor` input parameter in the BboxDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The `crop_factor` input parameter in the BboxDetectorSEGS node determines the extent to which the area around the detected object is included in the crop, affecting the context provided around the detected object."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main use of the BboxDetectorSEGS node in the ComfyUI impact pack?",
        "answer": "The BboxDetectorSEGS node is used to detect bounding boxes around objects within images, and it uses segmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy and detail of the detection process, primarily applied in Object Detection and Segmentation."
