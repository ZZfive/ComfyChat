        "question": "What does the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node in ComfyUI is designed to scale latent representations of images by a specified ratio, adjusting their dimensions while maintaining the integrity of the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node are the `latent` representation of an image, a `modifier` which is the scaling factor, a `scale_method` specifying the scaling method, and a `crop` method to be applied after scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `latent` input utilized in the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The `latent` input in the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node represents the base dimensions of the image which will be modified according to the specified scaling ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `modifier` input in the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The `modifier` input in the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node determines how much the latent dimensions should be increased or decreased, acting as the scaling factor for the image's dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which scaling methods are available for the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node supports various scaling methods such as nearest-exact and bilinear, affecting the quality and characteristics of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node handle cropping?",
        "answer": "The DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node allows for cropping methods to be applied after scaling, which include disabled and center, enabling adjustments in the latent's aspect ratio or size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node generate?",
        "answer": "The output of the DF_Latent_Scale_by_ratio node is a scaled latent representation adjusted according to the specified modifier, scale method, and cropping preference, with the data type `LATENT`."
