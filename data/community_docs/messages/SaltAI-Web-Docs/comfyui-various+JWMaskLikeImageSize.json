        "question": "What does the JWMaskLikeImageSize node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskLikeImageSize node generates a mask of the same size as the input image, filled with a specified value, which is useful for creating uniform masks that match the dimensions of a given image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The JWMaskLikeImageSize node belongs to the 'jamesWalker55' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWMaskLikeImageSize node are `image` (Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`) and `value` (Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`, Python dtype: `float`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `value` input in the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `value` input in the JWMaskLikeImageSize node is to specify a float value that is used to fill the generated mask, allowing for customization of the mask's intensity or transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node is `mask` (Comfy dtype: `MASK`, Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`), which is a mask tensor of the same size as the input image, filled with the specified value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the JWMaskLikeImageSize node is `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWMaskLikeImageSize node an output node?",
        "answer": "No, the JWMaskLikeImageSize node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
