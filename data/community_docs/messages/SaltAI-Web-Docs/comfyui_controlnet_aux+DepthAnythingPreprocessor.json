        "question": "What is the DepthAnythingPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DepthAnythingPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images for depth estimation tasks using different pretrained models based on the checkpoint name provided, simplifying model selection and preprocessing for generating depth maps."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can assist in producing depth maps from input images?",
        "answer": "The DepthAnythingPreprocessor node can assist in producing depth maps from input images by preprocessing them for depth estimation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of models does the DepthAnythingPreprocessor node support?",
        "answer": "The DepthAnythingPreprocessor node supports models with checkpoint names such as \"depth_anything_vitl14.pth\", \"depth_anything_vitb14.pth\", and \"depth_anything_vits14.pth\" for depth estimation tasks."
