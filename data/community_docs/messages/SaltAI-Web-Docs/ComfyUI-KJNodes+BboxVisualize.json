        "question": "What is the BboxVisualize node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxVisualize node in ComfyUI is designed to overlay bounding boxes on images, enhancing visual analysis by clearly demarcating areas of interest with specified line widths and colors."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter determines the thickness of the lines used to draw bounding boxes in BboxVisualize?",
        "answer": "The parameter `line_width` determines the thickness of the lines used to draw the bounding boxes in BboxVisualize, affecting the visibility and prominence of the highlighted areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the `images` parameter in the BboxVisualize node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the `images` parameter in the BboxVisualize node is `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the BboxVisualize node output in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxVisualize node outputs a modified batch of images with bounding boxes drawn over them, ready for visual inspection or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `bboxes` parameter represent in the BboxVisualize node?",
        "answer": "The `bboxes` parameter represents a list of bounding box coordinates specifying the areas to be highlighted on the images in the BboxVisualize node, playing a crucial role in determining the exact regions to be visualized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BboxVisualize node functionally operate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BboxVisualize node functionally operates by taking images, bounding box coordinates, and a line width parameter, then overlays the bounding boxes on the images with the specified line width before returning the modified images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the BboxVisualize node categorized in ComfyUI's node list?",
        "answer": "The BboxVisualize node is categorized under 'KJNodes/masking' in ComfyUI's node list."
