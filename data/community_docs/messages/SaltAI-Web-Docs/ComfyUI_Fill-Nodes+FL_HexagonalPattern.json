        "question": "What is the FL_HexagonalPattern node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The FL_HexagonalPattern node is designed to transform a collection of images into a hexagonal pattern, adjusting the size of hexagons based on the image dimensions and applying optional shadow effects for enhanced visual depth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the FL_HexagonalPattern node fall under?",
        "answer": "The FL_HexagonalPattern node falls under the '.RibbonÔ∏èFill Nodes' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the FL_HexagonalPattern node is a collection of images referred to as `images`, which is essential for the node's operation and serves as the primary input around which the hexagonal pattern is generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the size of the hexagons in the pattern created by the FL_HexagonalPattern node be adjusted?",
        "answer": "The size of the hexagons in the pattern can be adjusted using the `hexagon_size` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional parameters are available for customization in the FL_HexagonalPattern node?",
        "answer": "Optional parameters available for customization in the FL_HexagonalPattern node include `hexagon_size`, `shadow_offset`, `shadow_color`, `background_color`, `rotation`, and `spacing`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `rotation` parameter control in the FL_HexagonalPattern?",
        "answer": "The `rotation` parameter controls the rotation angle of each hexagon in the pattern, offering an additional dimension of stylistic customization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the transformed image output by the FL_HexagonalPattern node described?",
        "answer": "The transformed image output by the FL_HexagonalPattern node is described as having the applied hexagonal pattern, incorporating any specified shadow effects and background color, with the Comfy data type of `IMAGE`."
