        "question": "What is the purpose of the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSegDetectorProvider node is designed to leverage the capabilities of CLIPSeg for object detection within images, processing textual descriptions and image characteristics to identify and delineate objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSegDetectorProvider node belongs to the 'ImpactPack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter of CLIPSegDetectorProvider is crucial for guiding the model in object identification?",
        "answer": "The 'text' input parameter is crucial for guiding the CLIPSeg model in identifying the relevant objects within the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'blur' parameter in CLIPSegDetectorProvider help in object detection?",
        "answer": "The 'blur' parameter in CLIPSegDetectorProvider specifies the level of blur applied to the image before detection, which can help in reducing noise and improving the accuracy of object detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'dilation_factor' parameter control in the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation_factor' parameter in CLIPSegDetectorProvider determines the extent to which the detected object's boundaries are expanded or contracted, adjusting the preciseness of the object's outline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node output?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSegDetectorProvider node outputs a 'bbox_detector', which is an object detector based on the CLIPSeg model, capable of identifying and bounding objects within images based on textual descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "On which type of hardware does the CLIPSegDetectorProvider node operate?",
        "answer": "The CLIPSegDetectorProvider node operates on 'GPU' type hardware."
