    {
        "question": "Can you describe the core functionality of the Image to Seed node?",
        "answer": "The core functionality of the Image to Seed node is to take a collection of images and transform them into a set of numerical seeds, offering a bridge between visual content and numerical representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the typical use case for the output generated by the Image to Seed node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image to Seed node, which is a list of integers, can be used for further processing or analysis based on the derived seeds that represent numerical versions of the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does the list of images input to the Image to Seed node have?",
        "answer": "The list of images input to the Image to Seed node has a Python dtype of List[torch.Tensor]."
