        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Tile Offset (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the positioning of tiles within an image, allowing for precise alignment of image segments, which is crucial for tasks such as image stitching or texture mapping."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node include the `image`, which is the input image to be processed for tile offset adjustment, `tilesX` specifying the number of horizontal tiles, and `tilesY` specifying the number of vertical tiles into which the image is divided."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `tilesX` parameter in the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `tilesX` parameter in the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node specifies the number of horizontal tiles into which the image is divided, which is crucial for determining the horizontal segmentation of the image for tile adjustment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node is the `image` after applying the tile offset adjustments, reflecting the changes made to the tile positioning and showcasing the alignment modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` translate to in Python for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype `IMAGE` translates to the Python dtype `torch.Tensor` for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node, indicating that the images are handled as PyTorch tensors."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node be used on a CPU?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node can be used on a CPU as its infra type is listed as `CPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What exception is raised if the number of tiles (tilesX, tilesY) specified for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node is less than 1?",
        "answer": "If the number of tiles (tilesX, tilesY) specified for the Image Tile Offset (mtb) node is less than 1, a `ValueError` is raised indicating that the number of tiles must be at least 1."
