        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Float node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Float node in ComfyUI is designed to handle floating-point numbers within a specified range, allowing for precise numerical inputs in various computational tasks. It facilitates accurate calculations and data manipulation by serving as a fundamental building block in operations requiring decimal values."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the IG Float node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Float node belongs to the 'IG Nodes/Primitives' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input parameter required for the IG Float node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameter for the IG Float node is `value`, which specifies the floating-point number to be processed. This parameter is crucial for defining the numerical input that the node will handle, and it directly influences the output based on the given value."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the IG Float node handle values outside the range of Python's `float` type?",
        "answer": "No, the IG Float node cannot handle values outside the range of Python's `float` type. The `value` input parameter is constrained within the limitations of the `FLOAT` data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to Python's `float` type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the IG Float node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the IG Float node is the processed floating-point number, which is identical to the input value. This output is essential for further numerical computations or as input to other nodes requiring decimal values."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes in ComfyUI typically take the output of the IG Float node as input?",
        "answer": "Common nodes that typically take the output of the IG Float node as input in ComfyUI are unspecified. The IG Float node is a general-purpose node used for processing and transferring floating-point values to any node that requires decimal inputs for computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infra does the IG Float node use?",
        "answer": "The IG Float node uses the 'CPU' infra type in ComfyUI."
