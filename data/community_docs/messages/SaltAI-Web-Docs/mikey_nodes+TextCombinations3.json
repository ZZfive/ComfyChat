        "question": "What is the TextCombinations3 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "TextCombinations3 is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to generate a variety of text combinations based on predefined text inputs and operations, allowing for dynamic creation of text outputs potentially incorporating randomness through a seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations3 node requires `text1`, `text2`, and `text3` as string inputs, `operation` to specify how the texts should be combined, `delimiter` to separate text components, `use_seed` to determine if randomness is applied, and `seed` for randomizing operation selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `use_seed` parameter in the TextCombinations3 node control?",
        "answer": "The `use_seed` parameter in the TextCombinations3 node controls whether a seed value is used to introduce randomness into the operation selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the TextCombinations3 node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the TextCombinations3 node are three strings: `output1`, `output2`, and `output3`, each representing a generated text output based on the specified operation and inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TextCombinations3 node incorporate randomness in text combination?",
        "answer": "The TextCombinations3 node incorporates randomness in text combination by allowing the user to set the `use_seed` parameter to true and providing a `seed` value, which will be used to randomize the operation selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `seed` input in TextCombinations3?",
        "answer": "The `seed` input in TextCombinations3 is used for randomizing the operation selection when `use_seed` is set to true, ensuring reproducible randomness in text combination operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the TextCombinations3 node generate text outputs with multiple variations?",
        "answer": "Yes, the TextCombinations3 node can generate text outputs with multiple variations. It produces three separate output strings `output1`, `output2`, and `output3`, each offering a different variant based on the combination of input texts and the chosen operation."
