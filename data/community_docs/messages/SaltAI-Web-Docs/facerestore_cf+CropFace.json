        "question": "What is the CropFace node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CropFace node in ComfyUI is designed to process images by detecting faces, cropping them, and applying a face restoration model to enhance or restore the cropped face images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is required for the CropFace node to perform face processing?",
        "answer": "The CropFace node requires an input image and a face detection model for processing. The image is the input to be processed for face detection and restoration, while the face detection model is used to identify and locate faces within the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which face detection models can be used with the CropFace node?",
        "answer": "The CropFace node can use face detection models such as 'retinaface_resnet50', 'retinaface_mobile0.25', 'YOLOv5l', and 'YOLOv5n' when it is set up in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the CropFace node generate after processing?",
        "answer": "The output from the CropFace node is a tensor of the cropped and restored faces. This tensor is of dtype 'IMAGE', which is ready for further processing or visualization in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'facedetection' input in the CropFace node?",
        "answer": "The 'facedetection' input in the CropFace node is used to specify the face detection model which is responsible for identifying and locating faces within the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the CropFace node belong to in ComfyUI, and is it an output node?",
        "answer": "The CropFace node belongs to the 'facerestore_cf' category in ComfyUI and is not an output node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the CropFace node perform face restoration on multiple faces within a single image?",
        "answer": "Yes, the CropFace node can process multiple faces within a single image, as it identifies, crops, and processes each face individually through the face restoration model in ComfyUI."
