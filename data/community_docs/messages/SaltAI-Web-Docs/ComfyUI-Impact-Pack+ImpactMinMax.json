        "question": "What is the ImpactMinMax node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMinMax node in ComfyUI is designed to compare two input values and return either the maximum or minimum value based on a specified mode. This functionality is essential for operations requiring conditional selection between two values such as optimizing performance or making decisions based on dynamic input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output of the ImpactMinMax node as the maximum or minimum value?",
        "answer": "The output of the ImpactMinMax node as the maximum or minimum value is determined by the 'mode' input. When 'mode' is true, the node returns the maximum value; otherwise, it returns the minimum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the ImpactMinMax node?",
        "answer": "The input types for the ImpactMinMax node include: 'mode' of type boolean, 'a' and 'b' which can take any type (*)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the ImpactMinMax node produce?",
        "answer": "The ImpactMinMax node produces an integer output ('INT') which is the result of the comparison, either the maximum or minimum value between the two inputs, depending on the mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name defined in the source code of the ImpactMinMax node?",
        "answer": "The function name defined in the source code of the ImpactMinMax node is 'doit'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter of the ImpactMinMax node's INPUT_TYPES method specifies the type of the 'mode' input?",
        "answer": "The parameter 'mode': (\"BOOLEAN\", {\"default\": True, \"label_on\": \"max\", \"label_off\": \"min\"}) specifies the type of the 'mode' input as a boolean in the ImpactMinMax node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the ImpactMinMax node associated with according to the usage tips?",
        "answer": "According to the usage tips, the ImpactMinMax node is associated with the infrastructure type 'CPU'."
