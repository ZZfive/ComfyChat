        "question": "What is the purpose of the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node is designed to parse and replace specific text patterns with corresponding embeddings names, facilitating the integration of pre-defined embeddings into text inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node?",
        "answer": "You can find the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node under the category 'WAS Suite/Text/Parse' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type generated by the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node?",
        "answer": "The Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node outputs a string with the specific patterns replaced by their corresponding embeddings names."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter is crucial for the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The crucial parameter for the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node is the `text` input, which determines the content that will be processed and potentially transformed by replacing identified patterns with their corresponding embeddings names."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type does the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node support?",
        "answer": "The Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node supports 'CPU' as the infra type for its operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node replace in the input text?",
        "answer": "The Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node scans the input text for known embeddings identifiers and substitutes them with a standardized format, replacing specific patterns with their corresponding embeddings names."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are the embeddings names formatted after being replaced by the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node?",
        "answer": "After being replaced by the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node, the embeddings names are formatted as 'embedding:[basename]', where [basename] is the base name of the embedding file without the extension."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node be used for real-time text processing?",
        "answer": "The text about the Text Parse A1111 Embeddings node does not specify real-time processing capabilities; it focuses on parsing and replacing patterns in input text for compatibility with further processing steps."
