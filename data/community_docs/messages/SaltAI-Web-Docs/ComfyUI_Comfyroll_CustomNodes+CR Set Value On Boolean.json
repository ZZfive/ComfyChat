    {
        "question": "What determines the branch of conditional logic to follow in the CR Set Value On Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The branch of conditional logic in the CR Set Value On Boolean node is determined by the `boolean` input; if true, the node outputs the `value_if_true`, otherwise, it outputs `value_if_false`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the CR Set Value On Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The CR Set Value On Boolean node requires a `boolean` input of dtype `BOOLEAN`, and `value_if_true` and `value_if_false` inputs of dtype `FLOAT`."

    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the CR Set Value On Boolean node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The common nodes used with the CR Set Value On Boolean node are not specified, as noted in the documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the CR Set Value On Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The CR Set Value On Boolean node outputs `INT`, `FLOAT`, and `STRING` types, providing numeric outcomes and a URL to documentation based on the boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `show_help` output of the CR Set Value On Boolean node represent?",
        "answer": "The `show_help` output of the CR Set Value On Boolean node provides a URL to the node's documentation, offering additional help and examples."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type of the CR Set Value On Boolean node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the CR Set Value On Boolean node is `CPU`."
