        "question": "What is the purpose of the DF_Logic_node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DF_Logic_node in ComfyUI is designed to perform basic logical operations including comparisons and boolean operations between input values, aiding in decision-making processes by evaluating conditions and determining outcomes based on specified logic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Operation input of the DF_Logic_node specify?",
        "answer": "The Operation input of the DF_Logic_node specifies the logical operation to be performed, including comparisons like 'A > B', 'A < B', and 'A = B', and boolean operations such as 'A AND B', 'A OR B', and 'A XOR B.' This dictates the logic applied between CompareValue_A and CompareValue_B."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the CompareValue_A input in the LogicNode?",
        "answer": "The CompareValue_A input in the LogicNode serves as the primary value for comparison or logical operation. It is used in conjunction with CompareValue_B to evaluate the specified operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the output value of a LogicNode in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output value of a LogicNode in ComfyUI is determined by the result of the logical operation. It can be either the OnTrue or OnFalse value based on the operation's outcome."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LogicNode handle the 'A > B' operation?",
        "answer": "The LogicNode handles the 'A > B' operation by evaluating if CompareValue_A is greater than CompareValue_B. If true, it returns the OnTrue value; otherwise, it returns the OnFalse value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the LogicNode in ComfyUI if the logical operation cannot be determined?",
        "answer": "If the logical operation cannot be determined based on the inputs provided to the LogicNode in ComfyUI, it returns None as the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is supported by the LogicNode in ComfyUI for processing?",
        "answer": "The LogicNode in ComfyUI is designed to operate using the CPU infra type for processing logical operations."
