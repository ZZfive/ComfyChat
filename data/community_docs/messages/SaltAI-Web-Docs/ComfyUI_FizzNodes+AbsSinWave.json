        "question": "What is AbsSinWave in the context of ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "AbsSinWave is a custom node in ComfyUI belonging to the FizzNodes ðŸ“…ðŸ…•utta category, specifically within the WaveNodes subcategory. It generates a sine wave pattern whose output is altered by taking the absolute value of the sine function, producing a unique wave pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter controls the period of the sine wave in AbsSinWave?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in AbsSinWave controls the period of the sine wave, affecting the speed at which the wave cycles through its pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'amplitude' parameter determine in AbsSinWave?",
        "answer": "The 'amplitude' parameter in AbsSinWave determines the height of the wave peaks, influencing the overall intensity of the wave pattern."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the starting position of a wave adjusted in AbsSinWave?",
        "answer": "The starting position of the wave in AbsSinWave is adjusted using the 'x_translation' parameter, which shifts the wave along the x-axis."
    },
    {
        "question": "In AbsSinWave, what role does the 'current_frame' parameter play?",
        "answer": "The 'current_frame' parameter in AbsSinWave specifies the point in time or the frame for which the wave's value is calculated, critical for the wave's progression and animation scheduling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the AbsSinWave node?",
        "answer": "The AbsSinWave node outputs two values: the first is the calculated wave value as a float, reflecting the wave's current state, and the second is the integer representation of the same value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the maximum value of the wave controlled in AbsSinWave?",
        "answer": "The maximum value the wave can reach in AbsSinWave is controlled by the 'max_value' parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What transformation does the AbsSinWave node apply to the sine function?",
        "answer": "AbsSinWave applies a transformation to the sine function by taking the absolute value of its output, thus altering the wave pattern in a distinctive way."
