        "question": "What is the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to preprocess images for normal map generation using the DSINE model. It optimizes the model's performance for generating detailed normal maps from input images by adjusting the field of view and iteration parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required and optional input types for the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is the `image` input, which is the target for normal map generation. Optional input types include `fov` for adjusting the field of view, `iterations` for controlling the number of refinement steps, and `resolution` for specifying the output resolution of the generated normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input represent in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node serves as the base for the DSINE model to apply its processing and generate the normal map. It is the target image for normal map generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the detail and accuracy of the generated normal map be adjusted in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The detail and accuracy of the generated normal map can be adjusted in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node by setting the `iterations` parameter, which controls the number of refinement steps the model performs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `fov` parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node control?",
        "answer": "The `fov` parameter in the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node adjusts the perspective from which the normal map is generated, affecting the depth perception and detail in the resulting image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is `image`, which is a normal map image that visually represents surface normals as colors, providing detailed information about the surface geometry of the input image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of device does the DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node use for processing?",
        "answer": "The DSINE-NormalMapPreprocessor node uses the `GPU` infra type for processing."
