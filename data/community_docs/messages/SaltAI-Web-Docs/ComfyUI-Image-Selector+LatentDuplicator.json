        "question": "What is the LatentDuplicator node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The LatentDuplicator node in ComfyUI is designed to duplicate latent images a specified number of times, facilitating the generation of multiple copies of the same image for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the LatentDuplicator node?",
        "answer": "The LatentDuplicator node requires two input types: a latent_image, which is the input latent image to be duplicated, and dup_times, which specifies the number of times the input latent image should be duplicated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does 'latent_image' represent in the context of the LatentDuplicator node?",
        "answer": "In the context of the LatentDuplicator node, 'latent_image' represents the input latent image to be duplicated. It serves as the base image from which multiple copies will be generated, based on the duplication count specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'dup_times' in the LatentDuplicator node input?",
        "answer": "The 'dup_times' input in the LatentDuplicator node specifies the number of times the input latent image should be duplicated, determining how many copies of the base image will be produced."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the LatentDuplicator node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentDuplicator node is 'latent', which is a single tensor containing the duplicated latent images concatenated together, effectively multiplying the number of available images for subsequent operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for 'latent_image' in the LatentDuplicator node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for 'latent_image' in the LatentDuplicator node is 'clabc.Mapping[str, torch.Tensor]', indicating it is a mapping object from a custom package to a torch tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LatentDuplicator node handle the duplication of the latent image?",
        "answer": "The LatentDuplicator node handles the duplication of the latent image by cloning the samples of the input latent image the number of times specified by dup_times, then concatenating these cloned tensors into a single tensor."
