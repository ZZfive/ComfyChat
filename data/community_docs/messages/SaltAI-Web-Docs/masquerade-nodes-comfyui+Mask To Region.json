        "question": "What is the 'Mask To Region' node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask To Region' node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a given mask into a rectangular region that encompasses the mask, adhering to specified constraints such as padding, aspect ratio, and minimum dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the 'mask' input parameter in the 'Mask To Region' node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the 'mask' input parameter in the 'Mask To Region' node is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does 'Mask To Region' belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "'Mask To Region' belongs to the 'Masquerade Nodes' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the extracted rectangular region from a mask outputted?",
        "answer": "The extracted rectangular region from a mask is outputted as an image with a Comfy dtype of 'IMAGE' and a Python dtype of 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_behavior' parameter in the 'Mask To Region' node control?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_behavior' parameter dictates how the node should handle multiple masks in a batch, focusing on matching aspect ratios or sizes."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what cases is the 'constraint_x' parameter relevant?",
        "answer": "The 'constraint_x' parameter is relevant for setting a constraint on the region's width, ensuring it adheres to specified requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which infra type is indicated for the 'Mask To Region' class?",
        "answer": "The 'Mask To Region' class indicates 'GPU' as the infra type."
