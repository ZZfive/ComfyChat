    {
        "question": "What does ImageTransformPaddingRelative do?",
        "answer": "ImageTransformPaddingRelative dynamically calculates and applies padding to images based on scale factors for width and height, while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageTransformPaddingRelative?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageTransformPaddingRelative include 'images' of type IMAGE, 'scale_width' of type FLOAT, 'scale_height' of type FLOAT, and 'method' of type COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageTransformPaddingRelative determine the amount of padding?",
        "answer": "ImageTransformPaddingRelative determines the amount of padding based on the scale factors 'scale_width' and 'scale_height', which are relative to the original dimensions of the images."
