        "question": "What is the purpose of the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node in ComfyUI is designed to apply an advanced control network to SEGS (segmentation masks) with additional parameters for fine-tuning the application process, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the control network's influence over the segmentation masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'segs' input represent in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'segs' input in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node represents the segmentation masks to which the control network will be applied. It is crucial for defining the areas of interest for modification."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which control network is used by the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The control network used by the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node is specified by the 'control_net' input, which determines the nature of the modifications applied to the segs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the effect of the control network's intensity adjusted in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The intensity of the control network's effect on the segmentation masks in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node is adjusted by the 'strength' input, which is a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'start_percent' parameter play in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' parameter in the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node represents the starting percentage of the control network's effect, allowing for gradual application of the network from a certain point onwards."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node be used with an optional image input?",
        "answer": "The ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node can be used with an optional image input through the 'control_image' parameter, which can further guide the modifications applied to the segmentation masks alongside the control network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS node is 'segs', which represents the modified segmentation masks after the application of the control network, reflecting the adjustments made."
