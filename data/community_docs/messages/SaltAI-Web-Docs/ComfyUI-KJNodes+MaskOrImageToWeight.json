        "question": "What does the MaskOrImageToWeight node in ComfyUI calculate?",
        "answer": "The MaskOrImageToWeight node calculates the mean values of input masks or images provided to it, but not both simultaneously."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the valid output formats that the MaskOrImageToWeight node can generate?",
        "answer": "The MaskOrImageToWeight node can output the calculated mean values as a list, pandas series, or tensor based on the specified output type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can convert mask or image input into mean values?",
        "answer": "The MaskOrImageToWeight node is designed for calculating mean values from either masks or images provided as input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'output_type' parameter in the MaskOrImageToWeight node?",
        "answer": "The 'output_type' parameter in MaskOrImageToWeight node dictates the format in which the calculated mean values from input masks or images are returned."

        "question": "What exception is raised if both mask and image inputs are provided to the MaskOrImageToWeight node?",
        "answer": "If both mask and image inputs are provided to the MaskOrImageToWeight node, an exception is raised indicating that only one type of input (masks or images) should be used."
