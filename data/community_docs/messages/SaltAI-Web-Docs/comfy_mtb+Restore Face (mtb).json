        "question": "What is the Restore Face (mtb) node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Restore Face (mtb) node in ComfyUI is used for enhancing and restoring faces in images using GFPGan, improving visual quality and details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What model does the Restore Face (mtb) node use for face restoration?",
        "answer": "The Restore Face (mtb) node uses GFPGan as the model for face restoration."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Restore Face (mtb) node adjust the intensity of face restoration?",
        "answer": "The Restore Face (mtb) node allows for fine-tuning the intensity of face restoration through the `weight` input parameter, which is a float value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `aligned` parameter in the Restore Face (mtb) node for?",
        "answer": "The `aligned` parameter in the Restore Face (mtb) node is a boolean that indicates if the input faces are aligned, affecting how the model processes the image for potentially improved restoration quality on aligned faces."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Restore Face (mtb) node focus the restoration on only the center face?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Restore Face (mtb) node can focus the restoration on only the center face when the `only_center_face` boolean is set to true."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `save_tmp_steps` parameter in the Restore Face (mtb) node do?",
        "answer": "The `save_tmp_steps` parameter in the Restore Face (mtb) node, when set to true, indicates whether to save intermediate steps of the restoration process, which can be useful for debugging or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Restore Face (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Restore Face (mtb) node outputs an enhanced image tensor with improved facial details and overall image quality, with Python dtype `torch.Tensor`."
