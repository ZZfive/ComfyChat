        "question": "What is the purpose of the IG Cross Fade Images node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IG Cross Fade Images node is designed to create a series of images that smoothly transition from one set to another using cross-fading effects, leveraging easing functions to adjust the transition's pace."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the IG Cross Fade Images node's usage?",
        "answer": "The required input types for IG Cross Fade Images node include `input_images` (a list of image tensors for transition effects generation), `interpolation` (determines the easing function for cross-fade), `transitioning_frames` (specifies the number of frames for transition smoothness), and `repeat_count` (controls the image repetition before transitioning)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `interpolation` input parameter determine in the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The `interpolation` input parameter determines the easing function used to calculate the alpha values for the cross-fade effect, which affects the transition's dynamics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values of the `interpolation` input for the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The possible values of the `interpolation` input for the IG Cross Fade Images node are 'linear', 'ease_in', 'ease_out', 'ease_in_out', 'bounce', 'elastic', 'glitchy', and 'exponential_ease_out'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `transitioning_frames` input parameter in the IG Cross Fade Images node?",
        "answer": "The `transitioning_frames` input parameter in the IG Cross Fade Images node specifies the number of frames dedicated to transitioning between each pair of images, influencing the smoothness of the cross-fade effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the IG Cross Fade Images node output?",
        "answer": "The IG Cross Fade Images node outputs a tensor containing the sequence of cross-faded images, representing the smooth transition between the input images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IG Cross Fade Images node control the animation's pacing?",
        "answer": "The IG Cross Fade Images node controls the animationâ€™s pacing through the `repeat_count` input, which dictates how many times the current image is repeated before transitioning."
