        "question": "What is the HEDPreprocessor node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The HEDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed for extracting soft-edge lines from images using the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) model. It preprocesses images to enhance or isolate their line features, making it suitable for tasks that require detailed edge or line detection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does HEDPreprocessor produce?",
        "answer": "HEDPreprocessor produces an IMAGE output type in Comfy dtype, which is a torch.Tensor in Python dtype. This is the processed image with enhanced or isolated soft-edge lines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'resolution' input in HEDPreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' input in HEDPreprocessor specifies the resolution to which the input image is resized before processing. Higher resolutions may improve detail but at the cost of increased computation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can safety checks be toggled in HEDPreprocessor, and how is this done?",
        "answer": "Safety checks can be toggled in HEDPreprocessor using the 'safe' input. It's a COMBO[STRING] type in Comfy dtype and a str type in Python dtype. Setting 'safe' to 'enable' activates safety checks, which may affect the output's fidelity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common nodes does HEDPreprocessor work well with?",
        "answer": "HEDPreprocessor works well with the following common nodes: ControlNetApplyAdvanced, PreviewImage, and ACN_AdvancedControlNetApply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of task is the HEDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI particularly suitable for?",
        "answer": "The HEDPreprocessor node in ComfyUI is particularly suitable for tasks that require detailed edge or line detection from images, as it specializes in extracting soft-edge lines using the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) model."
    },
    {
        "question": "On what infrastructure is HEDPreprocessor recommended to be run for optimal performance?",
        "answer": "HEDPreprocessor is recommended to be run on GPU infrastructure for optimal performance, as indicated by the 'Infra type: GPU' usage tip."
