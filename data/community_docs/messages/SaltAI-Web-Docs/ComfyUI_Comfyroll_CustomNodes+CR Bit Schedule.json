        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Bit Schedule node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Bit Schedule node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a schedule based on a binary string, which abstracts the process of creating time-based sequences from binary data, facilitating the scheduling of animations or other time-sensitive operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input does the CR Bit Schedule node require to determine the timing of the sequence?",
        "answer": "The CR Bit Schedule node requires an 'interval' input to specify the time gap between each state in the schedule, which determines the pace at which the binary string's states are processed and included in the schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input of the CR Bit Schedule node is used to repeat the binary string in the schedule for a desired duration?",
        "answer": "The 'loops' input of the CR Bit Schedule node defines how many times the binary string is repeated in the schedule, allowing for the extension or repetition of the sequence to meet the desired duration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the CR Bit Schedule node generate in relation to the schedule it creates?",
        "answer": "The CR Bit Schedule node outputs a 'SCHEDULE', which is a string representation of the generated schedule, where each line corresponds to a time-stamped state derived from the binary string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'show_text' output of the CR Bit Schedule node provide?",
        "answer": "The 'show_text' output of the CR Bit Schedule node provides a link to helpful documentation or additional information related to the node's functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of CR Bit Schedule, what does the binary string represent?",
        "answer": "In CR Bit Schedule, the binary string input represents a sequence of states (0 or 1) that are used to generate the schedule, where each bit in the string corresponds to a state at a specific time interval, playing a crucial role in defining the schedule's structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which attribute is true about CR Bit Schedule in terms of resource usage?",
        "answer": "The CR Bit Schedule node uses 'CPU' as its 'Infra type', indicating that it is designed to operate on the computer's central processing unit."
