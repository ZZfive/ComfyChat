        "question": "What does ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration do?",
        "answer": "ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration applies a chromatic aberration effect to images, simulating the way light disperses through a lens, creating a visually distinctive color-fringing effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of applying chromatic aberration in images?",
        "answer": "The purpose of applying chromatic aberration in images is to enhance visual content by adding an artistic or realistic touch of lens imperfection, often used to give images a more dynamic or vintage appearance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the shift parameter affect the chromatic aberration effect?",
        "answer": "The shift parameter determines the shift in pixels to simulate the chromatic aberration effect, affecting the displacement of color channels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration include images, shift, method, shift_type, mixing_type, transpose, colors, and lens_curvy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the mixing_type parameter influence the chromatic aberration effect?",
        "answer": "The mixing_type parameter controls how the original and shifted color channels are combined, affecting the overall intensity and appearance of the chromatic aberration effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the lens_curvy parameter adjust?",
        "answer": "The lens_curvy parameter adjusts the curvature of the lens effect, modifying how pronounced the chromatic aberration appears across the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration?",
        "answer": "The output of ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration is transformed images with the chromatic aberration effect applied, showcasing visual enhancement or artistic touch added to the original content."
