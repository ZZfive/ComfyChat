        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleListExponentialFade node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleListExponentialFade node in ComfyUI is designed to apply an exponential fade effect to a schedule list, which enhances or diminishes the values in the list to create dynamic transitions based on the specified fade type and strength."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does SaltScheduleListExponentialFade belong to within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "SaltScheduleListExponentialFade belongs to the 'SALT/Scheduling/Filter' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the name of the function that performs the exponential fade effect in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade?",
        "answer": "The function that performs the exponential fade effect in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade is called 'exponential_fade'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the required input 'schedule_list' represent in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade?",
        "answer": "The required input 'schedule_list' in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade represents the list of values to apply the exponential fade effect to, serving as the base for dynamic transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of fade effects can be specified by the 'fade_type' input in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade?",
        "answer": "The 'fade_type' input in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade can specify three types of fade effects: 'in' for a gradual increase, 'out' for a gradual decrease, or 'in-and-out' for a combination of both."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'strength' input in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade determines the intensity of the fade effect, with higher values resulting in more pronounced fades."
    },
    {
        "question": "How doesSaltScheduleListExponentialFade handle optional 'start_index' input?",
        "answer": "The optional 'start_index' input in SaltScheduleListExponentialFade specifies the index in the schedule list from which to start applying the fade effect, allowing for partial fades within the list."
