        "question": "What is ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe is a class in the AnimateDiff framework designed to manage and apply keyframe configurations for animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe allow you to do?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe allows you to dynamically adjust animation parameters such as scale, effect intensity, and camera control settings at specific points in the animation timeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe include 'start_percent', which specifies the starting point of the keyframe within the animation timeline as a percentage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'start_percent' in ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe?",
        "answer": "'start_percent' in ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe specifies when the keyframe's effects begin to apply within the animation timeline, ensuring precise timing of animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some optional input types in ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe?",
        "answer": "Optional input types in ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe include 'prev_ad_keyframes', 'scale_multival', 'effect_multival', 'inherit_missing', and 'guarantee_steps', which provide flexibility in modifying and layering animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe handle 'prev_ad_keyframes'?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe allows for the inclusion of previous animation keyframes with the 'prev_ad_keyframes' parameter, facilitating continuity and layering of animation effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe return?",
        "answer": "ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe returns an updated collection of keyframes ('ad_keyframes'), including newly added or modified keyframes, to manage and sequence animation effects."
