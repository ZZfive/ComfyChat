        "question": "What is the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node in ComfyUI is designed to select every Nth mask from a batch of masks, facilitating operations such as thinning out data or creating subsets for specific processing needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node are the input mask tensor (`mask`) and the interval at which masks are selected (`select_every_nth`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'mask' parameter in VHS_SelectEveryNthMask represent?",
        "answer": "The 'mask' parameter in the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node represents the input mask tensor from which every Nth mask will be selected."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'select_every_nth' parameter control in the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The 'select_every_nth' parameter in the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node specifies the interval at which masks are selected from the input batch, determining the frequency of mask selection within the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output types does the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node provide?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node provides two output types: the output tensor containing every Nth mask selected (`MASK`), and the total count of masks selected and returned (`count`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category can you find the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node can be found in the category 'Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/mask' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output 'MASK' generated by the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node?",
        "answer": "The output 'MASK' in the VHS_SelectEveryNthMask node is generated by selecting every Nth mask from the input batch based on the specified interval."
