        "question": "What is the IG ZFill node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The IG ZFill node in ComfyUI is used to pad a given integer value with leading zeros until it reaches a specified length, providing a simple yet effective way for formatting numbers to ensure consistent digit counts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the IG ZFill node are `value`, an integer value to be padded with leading zeros, and `fill`, a parameter that determines the total length of the output string after padding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `value` parameter represent in the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The `value` parameter in the IG ZFill node represents the integer value that will undergo transformation by being padded with leading zeros."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `fill` parameter function in the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The `fill` parameter in the IG ZFill node sets the target length for the zero-filled string, so the output string will be padded to at least this length."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and Comfy dtype of the IG ZFill node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the IG ZFill node is `string`, and the Comfy dtype is `STRING`, which represents the resulting string after padding the input value with leading zeros to meet the specified length."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the IG ZFill node belong to in ComfyUI nodes?",
        "answer": "The IG ZFill node belongs to the `IG Nodes/Primitives` category in ComfyUI nodes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is IG ZFill an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, IG ZFill is not an output node in ComfyUI."
