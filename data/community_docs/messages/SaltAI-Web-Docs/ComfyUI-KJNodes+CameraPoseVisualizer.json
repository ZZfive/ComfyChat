    {
        "question": "What is the CameraPoseVisualizer node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer node is designed to visualize camera poses in a 3D plot, either from a specified file containing camera intrinsics and coordinates or from camera control poses provided directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type is used by the CameraPoseVisualizer node to determine the source of camera poses for visualization?",
        "answer": "The required input type `pose_file_path` specifies the path to a file containing camera poses or an empty string if camera control poses are provided directly, which is crucial for determining the source of camera poses to visualize."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the CameraPoseVisualizer adjust the depth positioning of camera representations in the plot?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer node adjusts the depth positioning of camera representations in the plot through the `zval` input parameter, which sets the z-value for the camera pyramid visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "For what purpose can the CameraPoseVisualizer node use an external viewer?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer node can use an external viewer for the visualization if the `use_viewer` boolean input is set to True, offering an alternative display method."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the CameraPoseVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the CameraPoseVisualizer node are `IMAGE` and `ui`, with the `IMAGE` type being the visual representation of camera poses in a 3D plot and the `ui` type also representing the visual result."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CameraPoseVisualizer determine the scale of the entire visualization?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer determines the scale of the entire visualization through the `scale` input parameter, allowing for zooming in or out of the scene, as it adjusts the scale of the entire visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `cameractrl_poses` input represent in the CameraPoseVisualizer node?",
        "answer": "The `cameractrl_poses` input in the CameraPoseVisualizer node directly provides camera control poses for visualization, offering an alternative to specifying a pose file path."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the CameraPoseVisualizer node fall in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer node falls under the category `KJNodes/misc` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CameraPoseVisualizer plot camera poses from camera intrinsics and coordinates?",
        "answer": "The CameraPoseVisualizer plots camera poses from camera intrinsics and coordinates by visualizing the camera poses either from a specified file or from camera control poses provided directly, in a 3D plot which showcases the spatial arrangement and orientation of cameras."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python type is associated with the `image` output of the CameraPoseVisualizer?",
        "answer": "The `image` output of the CameraPoseVisualizer node has the Python type `matplotlib.figure.Figure`, which is the visual representation of camera poses in a 3D plot."
