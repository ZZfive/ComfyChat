        "question": "What is the purpose of the SendMessage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SendMessage node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate communication between agents by allowing one agent to send a message to another."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SendMessage node ensure the integrity of the agents involved in communication?",
        "answer": "The SendMessage node ensures the integrity of the agents involved in communication by cloning the recipient and sender agents, which means the original agents' states are preserved post-message delivery."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the SendMessage node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SendMessage node are: 'recipient', the agent who will receive the message; 'sender', the agent who initiates the message; and 'message', the content to be sent, which supports multiline input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the 'sender' input type indicate in the SendMessage node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype and Python dtype for the 'sender' input type in the SendMessage node both indicate 'AGENT', specifying the type of data expected as the sender."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the SendMessage node?",
        "answer": "The output types generated by the SendMessage node are 'recipient' and 'sender', both of type 'AGENT', representing the cloned recipient and sender agents after the communication process respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of cloning the 'recipient' agent in the SendMessage node?",
        "answer": "Cloning the 'recipient' agent in the SendMessage node ensures that the original agent's state is preserved after the message delivery, allowing for the integrity of the agent involved in communication."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python class manages the node for sending messages between agents in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Python class 'SendMessage' manages the node for sending messages between agents in ComfyUI, with the method 'add_info' handling the message delivery process."
