        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Model Merge Stack node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Model Merge Stack node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the merging of multiple models into a single, cohesive model stack, enabling the integration of various models through specified merging methods, normalization of ratios, and weighting factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the CR Model Merge Stack node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the CR Model Merge Stack node include switch_1, ckpt_name1, model_ratio1, clip_ratio1, switch_2, ckpt_name2, model_ratio2, clip_ratio2, switch_3, ckpt_name3, model_ratio3, and clip_ratio3, which are used to control the inclusion and contribution of up to three models in the merge process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Model Merge Stack node handle the contribution of the first model in the merged output?",
        "answer": "The CR Model Merge Stack node handles the contribution of the first model in the merged output through the model_ratio1 input, which specifies the contribution ratio of the first model, affecting how prominently the model's features are represented in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can be provided to the CR Model Merge Stack node for additional model integration?",
        "answer": "An optional input, model_stack, can be provided to the CR Model Merge Stack node to include additional models beyond the primary three in the merging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output type MODEL_STACK from CR Model Merge Stack represent?",
        "answer": "The output type MODEL_STACK from the CR Model Merge Stack node represents the resulting merged model stack that combines the features of the input models according to the specified merge method, normalization, and weighting factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the switch inputs in CR Model Merge Stack?",
        "answer": "The switch inputs in CR Model Merge Stack, such as switch_1, switch_2, and switch_3, are used to activate or deactivate the inclusion of each respective model in the merging process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of information is provided by the show_help output of the CR Model Merge Stack node?",
        "answer": "The show_help output of the CR Model Merge Stack node provides a URL that directs users to additional help and documentation on how to effectively use the node for model merging in ComfyUI."
