        "question": "What is the purpose of the Robust Video Matting node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Robust Video Matting node is designed to perform high-quality video matting, separating foreground elements from the background in video frames using advanced deep learning models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of input is required for the 'video_frames' parameter in the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "The 'video_frames' parameter requires a sequence of video frames to be processed for matting with the Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which backbone model architectures can be chosen for the 'backbone' input in the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "Options for the 'backbone' input include 'mobilenetv3' and 'resnet50', which affect the accuracy and performance of the matting process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'fp16' input in the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "The 'fp16' input serves as a flag to indicate whether half-precision floating-point (FP16) should be used for computations, potentially improving performance on compatible hardware."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'bg_color' parameter specify in the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "The 'bg_color' parameter specifies the background color to apply when separating the foreground from the original background, input as a string."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'batch_size' parameter control in the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "The 'batch_size' parameter controls the number of frames to process in a single batch, which affects memory usage and processing speed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Robust Video Matting node?",
        "answer": "The Robust Video Matting node outputs 'image' with dtype `IMAGE` (showcasing the foreground elements with the background replaced or removed) and 'mask' with dtype `MASK` (indicating the presence of foreground elements in each frame)."
