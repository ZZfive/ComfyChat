        "question": "What node in ComfyUI applies a median filter to images?",
        "answer": "The Image Median Filter node in ComfyUI applies a median filter effect to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in the Image Median Filter node determines the diameter of the pixel neighborhood?",
        "answer": "The `diameter` parameter in the Image Median Filter node specifies the diameter of the pixel neighborhood used during filtering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What effect does adjusting the `sigma_color` parameter have on the output of the Image Median Filter node?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the `sigma_color` parameter controls the filter's sensitivity to color differences, where a higher value results in smoother color transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type to the Image Median Filter node must contain the image data to which the median filter will be applied?",
        "answer": "The `image` input type of the Image Median Filter node must contain the image or images to which the median filter will be applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Median Filter node in terms of data type and what does it represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Median Filter node is of type `IMAGE` and it represents the output image or images after applying the median filter, showcasing reduced noise without significant edge blurring."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Median Filter node help in image denoising?",
        "answer": "The Image Median Filter node helps in image denoising by applying a median filter effect, which enhances the quality of images by reducing noise without significantly blurring the edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name associated with the Image Median Filter node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the Image Median Filter node is `WAS_Image_Median_Filter`."
