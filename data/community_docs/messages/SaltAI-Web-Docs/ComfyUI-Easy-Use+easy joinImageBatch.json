        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy joinImageBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy joinImageBatch node is designed to transform a batch of images into a single, larger image by combining multiple images into one cohesive visual output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of images can the easy joinImageBatch node process?",
        "answer": "The easy joinImageBatch node processes images with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the `mode` parameter for in the easy joinImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` parameter specifies the method or mode used to combine the images into a single batch, influencing the arrangement and blending of individual images within the composite output. It can be set to either `horizontal` or `vertical`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the easy joinImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The output of the easy joinImageBatch node is a single, composite image created from the input batch of images, represented by a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Infra types supported by the easy joinImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The easy joinImageBatch node supports an Infra type of `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy joinImageBatch node arrange images in vertical mode?",
        "answer": "In vertical mode, the easy joinImageBatch node reshapes the batch of images so that they are stacked vertically, creating one large image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the easy joinImageBatch node arrange images in horizontal mode?",
        "answer": "In horizontal mode, the easy joinImageBatch node swaps axes and reshapes the batch of images so that they are concatenated horizontally, creating one large image."
