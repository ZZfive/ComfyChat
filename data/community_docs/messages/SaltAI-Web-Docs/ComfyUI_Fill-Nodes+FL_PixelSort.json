        "question": "What is the FL_PixelSort node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The FL_PixelSort node in ComfyUI is used to apply a pixel sorting effect to images based on their hue values, enabling artistic manipulation of image textures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main input types for the FL_PixelSort node?",
        "answer": "The main input types for the FL_PixelSort node include a collection of images, direction, threshold, smoothing, and rotation, all of which are used to customize the pixel sorting effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'direction' parameter in FL_PixelSort?",
        "answer": "The 'direction' parameter in FL_PixelSort specifies the direction of the pixel sorting process, either 'Horizontal' or 'Vertical', which affects the orientation of the sorting effect on the images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'threshold' parameter in FL_PixelSort affect the sorting process?",
        "answer": "The 'threshold' parameter in FL_PixelSort determines the sensitivity of hue changes required to trigger sorting. A lower threshold results in more aggressive sorting based on smaller hue differences."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter in FL_PixelSort controls the smoothness of image transitions?",
        "answer": "The 'smoothing' parameter in FL_PixelSort controls the smoothness of the transitions between sorted and unsorted regions, with higher values ensuring smoother transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the FL_PixelSort node generate?",
        "answer": "The FL_PixelSort node generates processed images with the pixel sorting effect applied, outputted as a torch.Tensor with the 'IMAGE' dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is rotation applied in the FL_PixelSort effect?",
        "answer": "Rotation is applied by the 'rotation' parameter in the FL_PixelSort effect, which indicates the number of 90-degree rotations to be performed on the image before sorting."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the computation dtype for the 'images' input in FL_PixelSort?",
        "answer": "The computation dtype for the 'images' input in FL_PixelSort is 'List[torch.Tensor]', indicating that it can process a list of PyTorch tensors representing images."
