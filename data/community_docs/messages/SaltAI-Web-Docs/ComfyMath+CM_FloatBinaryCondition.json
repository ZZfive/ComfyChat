        "question": "What is the purpose of CM_FloatBinaryCondition in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryCondition is a node in ComfyUI used for evaluating binary conditions between two floating-point numbers based on a specified operation. It simplifies various floating-point comparisons."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of operations can CM_FloatBinaryCondition perform on floating-point numbers?",
        "answer": "CM_FloatBinaryCondition can perform operations such as equality, inequality, greater than, and less than on two floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The output of the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node is a boolean value indicating the result of the binary condition operation between the two floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the first floating-point number specified in the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The first floating-point number in the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node is specified by the input parameter `a`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the type of comparison to be executed in the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The type of comparison executed in the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node is determined by the `op` parameter, which specifies the operation to perform on the two floating-point numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an example of how to use CM_FloatBinaryCondition in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "An example of using CM_FloatBinaryCondition in ComfyUI would involve specifying the operation (`op`) and inputting two floating-point numbers (`a` and `b`) to evaluate for equality, inequality, greater than, or less than."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `float` input type represent for the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node?",
        "answer": "The `float` input type for the CM_FloatBinaryCondition node represents the floating-point number that is to be compared against another floating-point number according to the specified operation."
