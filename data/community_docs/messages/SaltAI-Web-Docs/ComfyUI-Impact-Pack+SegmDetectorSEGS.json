        "question": "What is the purpose of the SegmDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SegmDetectorSEGS node in ComfyUI is designed to process images through segmentation models to detect and segment objects within the images, aiming to facilitate detailed object analysis by providing segmented regions along with their corresponding metadata."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the SegmDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the SegmDetectorSEGS node is `SegmDetectorSEGS`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the SegmDetectorSEGS node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SegmDetectorSEGS node belongs to the category `ImpactPack/Detector` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'segm_detector' input play in the SegmDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'segm_detector' input in the SegmDetectorSEGS node specifies the segmentation detector used for detecting and segmenting objects within the image, which is crucial for defining the detection capabilities and accuracy of the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is an image cropped for detailed object analysis by the SegmDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The image is cropped around the detected segments by using the 'crop_factor' parameter in the SegmDetectorSEGS node, which determines the extent of cropping, allowing for focused analysis on specific objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'dilation' input in the SegmDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The 'dilation' input in the SegmDetectorSEGS node specifies the amount of dilation to apply to the segmentation masks, enhancing the visibility and separation of detected objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which optional input can be used for custom post-processing of detected segments in the SegmDetectorSEGS node?",
        "answer": "The optional 'detailer_hook' input in the SegmDetectorSEGS node can be used for custom post-processing of detected segments, allowing for further refinement of the segmentation results."
