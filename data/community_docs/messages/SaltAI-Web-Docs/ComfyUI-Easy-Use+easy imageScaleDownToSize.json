    {
        "question": "In what category is the easy imageScaleDownToSize node classified in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy imageScaleDownToSize node is classified under the category `EasyUse/Image` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameter should be set if you want to scale an image in ComfyUI based on its larger dimension?",
        "answer": "If you want to scale an image in ComfyUI based on its larger dimension, you should set the `mode` parameter to `True`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method does the easy imageScaleDownToSize node use to determine the scaling factor?",
        "answer": "The easy imageScaleDownToSize node determines the scaling factor by dividing the target `size` parameter by the maximum or minimum of the image's width and height, as determined by the `mode` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the easy imageScaleDownToSize operation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output of the easy imageScaleDownToSize operation in ComfyUI is an image that has been scaled down to the specified size while maintaining the aspect ratio, with a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
