        "question": "What is the SUPIR_decode node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_decode node is used for transforming encoded latent representations back into images or other forms of visual data, utilizing a specific decoding process that may involve a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `SUPIR_VAE` input represent in the SUPIR_decode node?",
        "answer": "The `SUPIR_VAE` input represents the Variational Autoencoder model used for the decoding process, which is crucial for transforming latent representations back into their original form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `latents` input in the SUPIR_decode node?",
        "answer": "The `latents` input serves as the direct input for the reconstruction process, representing the encoded latent representations that are to be decoded back into images or similar visual data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `use_tiled_vae` flag affect the decoding process in the SUPIR_decode node?",
        "answer": "The `use_tiled_vae` flag, when set to `True`, indicates that the decoding process should utilize a tiled approach, potentially improving handling of larger images by processing them in segments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `decoder_tile_size` input play in the SUPIR_decode node?",
        "answer": "The `decoder_tile_size` input specifies the size of the tiles used in the tiled VAE approach, affecting the granularity of the decoding process and the handling of image details."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the SUPIR_decode node produce?",
        "answer": "The SUPIR_decode node produces an output of type `IMAGE`, which represents the output image reconstructed from the encoded latent representations, showcasing the node's decoding capability to transform compressed data back into visual form."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of SUPIR_decode, what does `torch.nn.Module` represent?",
        "answer": "In the context of SUPIR_decode, `torch.nn.Module` represents the class used for creating the `SUPIR_VAE` input, which is the Variational Autoencoder model used for the decoding process."
