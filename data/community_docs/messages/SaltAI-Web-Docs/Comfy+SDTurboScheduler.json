        "question": "What is SDTurboScheduler?",
        "answer": "SDTurboScheduler is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to generate a sequence of sigma values for image sampling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SDTurboScheduler adjust based on during image sampling?",
        "answer": "SDTurboScheduler adjusts the sequence of sigma values based on the denoise level and the number of steps specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SDTurboScheduler influence the denoising process?",
        "answer": "SDTurboScheduler influences the denoising process by generating sigma values that control the level of denoising applied during image generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for SDTurboScheduler?",
        "answer": "The required input types for SDTurboScheduler include the generative model, steps for sequence length, and denoise level."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of values does SDTurboScheduler produce as output?",
