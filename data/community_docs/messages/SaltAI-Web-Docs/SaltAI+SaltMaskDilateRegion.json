        "question": "What does the SaltMaskDilateRegion node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltMaskDilateRegion node applies a dilation filter to mask regions, effectively expanding the areas of interest within the masks based on the specified number of iterations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the dilation filter in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The dilation filter in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is designed to process and modify mask regions to highlight or enlarge specific features within the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the SaltMaskDilateRegion node are masks (Comfy dtype: MASK, Python dtype: torch.Tensor) and iterations (Comfy dtype: INT, Python dtype: int)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltMaskDilateRegion node impact the output masks?",
        "answer": "The output masks after dilation represent the modified regions with expanded areas of interest, showcasing the effect of the dilation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What controls the extent of dilation performed by the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The extent of dilation performed by the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is controlled by the iterations parameter, which specifies the number of times the dilation operation is applied to the masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the masks input in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the masks input in the SaltMaskDilateRegion node is torch.Tensor."
