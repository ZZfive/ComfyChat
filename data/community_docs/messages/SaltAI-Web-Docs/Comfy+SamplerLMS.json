        "question": "What is SamplerLMS?",
        "answer": "SamplerLMS is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to generate samplers using the LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SamplerLMS node is to facilitate the creation of samplers that utilize the LMS method for custom sampling strategies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'order' parameter specify in SamplerLMS?",
        "answer": "The 'order' parameter in SamplerLMS specifies the order of the LMS algorithm used in the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does adjusting the 'order' parameter affect the SamplerLMS node?",
        "answer": "Adjusting the 'order' parameter impacts the behavior, quality, and characteristics of the samples generated by the SamplerLMS node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does SamplerLMS provide?",
        "answer": "SamplerLMS provides a sampler output configured according to the LMS algorithm and the specified order parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does SamplerLMS support?",
        "answer": "SamplerLMS supports CPU infrastructure."
    },
