        "question": "What category does the CM_ComposeVec4 node belong to?",
        "answer": "The CM_ComposeVec4 node belongs to the 'math/conversion' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CM_ComposeVec4 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CM_ComposeVec4 node are four float values: x, y, z, and w, each representing a component of the four-dimensional vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the x component represent in the CM_ComposeVec4 node's input?",
        "answer": "The x component in the CM_ComposeVec4 node's input represents the first component of the Vec4, influencing its spatial or graphical representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the z input of CM_ComposeVec4 accept?",
        "answer": "The z input of CM_ComposeVec4 accepts float data, defining the third component of the Vec4, and affecting its spatial or graphical attributes."
