        "question": "What is the Cache Node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Cache Node in ComfyUI is designed to manage the caching process within a workflow, specifically handling the loading and saving of various types of data such as latent representations, images, and conditioning information to optimize workflow performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data can the Cache Node cache?",
        "answer": "The Cache Node can cache latent representations, images, and conditioning information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `latent_suffix` parameter in the Cache Node specify?",
        "answer": "The `latent_suffix` parameter in the Cache Node specifies the suffix for the latent data cache file, which is crucial for identifying and retrieving precomputed latent representations to enhance efficiency by avoiding redundant computations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which data type is associated with the `image_suffix` in the Cache Node?",
        "answer": "The `image_suffix` in the Cache Node is associated with the `STRING` data type in ComfyUI and the `str` data type in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `output_path` parameter used in the Cache Node?",
        "answer": "The `output_path` parameter in the Cache Node specifies the directory path where the cache files are stored or will be stored, essential for directing where to save or load cache files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input can be used to cache image data in the Cache Node?",
        "answer": "The optional input `image` is used to cache image data in the Cache Node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is used in the source code for the Cache Node?",
        "answer": "The class name used in the source code for the Cache Node is `WAS_Cache`."
