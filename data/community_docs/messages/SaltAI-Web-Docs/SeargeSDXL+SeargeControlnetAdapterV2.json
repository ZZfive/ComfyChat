        "question": "What is the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node in ComfyUI serves as an interface for adapting and applying control network configurations and annotations to input data, facilitating the enhancement or modification of images through various controlnet modes and preprocessing options."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'controlnet_mode' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node do?",
        "answer": "The 'controlnet_mode' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node specifies the mode of operation for the control network, allowing users to select different controlnet configurations for processing the input data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is used to determine the intensity of the controlnet effect in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'strength' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node determines the intensity of the controlnet effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the applied enhancements or modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'low_threshold' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node influence the controlnet processing?",
        "answer": "The 'low_threshold' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node sets the lower threshold for controlnet processing, influencing the sensitivity of the operation to input data features."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what context is the 'start_percent' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node used?",
        "answer": "The 'start_percent' input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node specifies the starting percentage of the input data to be processed, enabling selective application of the controlnet operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'data' optional input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node?",
        "answer": "The 'data' optional input in the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node is an optional data stream input that can be processed alongside image inputs for integrated controlnet operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node in ComfyUI outputs a processed data stream ('data') incorporating the applied controlnet modifications and a preview image ('preview') showcasing the effects of the controlnet operation on the input data."
