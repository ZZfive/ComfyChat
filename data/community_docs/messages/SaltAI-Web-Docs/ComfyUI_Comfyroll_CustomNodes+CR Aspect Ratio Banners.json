        "question": "What is the function of the CR Aspect Ratio Banners node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Aspect Ratio Banners node in ComfyUI is designed to adjust the aspect ratio of banners, allowing for customization of width, height, and aspect ratio parameters to cater to various banner size requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in CR Aspect Ratio Banners allows for swapping width and height dimensions?",
        "answer": "The input parameter 'swap_dimensions' in CR Aspect Ratio Banners allows for the swapping of width and height dimensions, which is useful for adapting the banner to different orientation requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'prescale_factor' parameter do in CR Aspect Ratio Banners?",
        "answer": "The 'prescale_factor' parameter in CR Aspect Ratio Banners indicates the factor by which the banner's dimensions should be prescaled before any other adjustments. This feature is useful for initial size modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an example of a standard aspect ratio provided by the 'aspect_ratio' input in CR Aspect Ratio Banners?",
        "answer": "An example of a standard aspect ratio provided by the 'aspect_ratio' input in CR Aspect Ratio Banners is 'Medium Rectangle - 300x250', which sets the banner dimensions to 300 by 250 pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'width' input in CR Aspect Ratio Banners expect?",
        "answer": "The 'width' input in CR Aspect Ratio Banners expects an integer value, known in ComfyUI as 'INT', to specify the desired width of the banner in pixels."
    },
    {
        "question": "What can the 'upscale_factor' parameter in CR Aspect Ratio Banners be used for?",
        "answer": "The 'upscale_factor' parameter in CR Aspect Ratio Banners specifies the factor by which the banner's dimensions should be upscaled. This feature enables the enlargement of banners while maintaining their aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the CR Aspect Ratio Banners node when invoked with appropriate parameters?",
        "answer": "When invoked with appropriate parameters, the CR Aspect Ratio Banners node returns the adjusted width and height of the banner, the factors by which the dimensions have been upscaled and prescaled, the batch size, a tensor representing the latent space of the processed banners, and a URL to the help documentation."
