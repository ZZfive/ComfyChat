        "question": "What is the Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Input Switch node is designed to selectively switch between two conditioning inputs based on a boolean value, facilitating dynamic control over which conditioning data is passed forward in a processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class and category does the Conditioning Input Switch node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Input Switch node belongs to the class `Conditioning Input Switch` and the category `WAS Suite/Logic`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the boolean input determine in the Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The boolean input in the Conditioning Input Switch node determines which of the two conditioning inputs (conditioning_a or conditioning_b) should be passed forward based on its truth value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first required input type for the Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The first required input type for the Conditioning Input Switch node is `conditioning_a`, which serves as one of the two possible conditioning data inputs to be selected based on a boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the Conditioning Input Switch node have?",
        "answer": "The Conditioning Input Switch node has an output type of `conditioning`, which outputs the selected conditioning input for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of conditioning_b input in the Conditioning Input Switch node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of conditioning_b input in the Conditioning Input Switch node is to act as an alternative to the first conditioning input, offering a choice that can be selected based on the boolean value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the boolean input?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the boolean input in the Conditioning Input Switch node is `bool`."
