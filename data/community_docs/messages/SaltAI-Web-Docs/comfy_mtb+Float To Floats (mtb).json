        "question": "What is the purpose of the Float To Floats (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node in ComfyUI is designed to convert a single float value into a list of floats to ensure compatibility with other extensions that use list format for float representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Float To Floats (mtb) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node belongs to the 'mtb/utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data types does the Float To Floats (mtb) node accept as input?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node accepts 'float' as input, expecting a single float value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Float To Floats (mtb) node output and in what form?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node outputs a list of floats, represented as 'FLOATS' which is a list derived from the single input float value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an example of an input type for the Float To Floats (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "An example of an input type for the Float To Floats (mtb) node is the 'float' data type, which represents a single float value that needs to be converted into a list of floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type does the Float To Floats (mtb) node use to represent its output?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node uses the Python 'list[float]' data type to represent its output, which is a list of floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the conversion functionality of Float To Floats (mtb) implemented in the source code?",
        "answer": "The conversion functionality of the Float To Floats (mtb) node is implemented in the source code by defining the class MTB_FloatToFloats with a method convert that takes a single float argument and returns a tuple containing that float, effectively converting it to a list format."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which use case would the Float To Floats (mtb) node be particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node would be particularly useful in scenarios where it is necessary to ensure compatibility with other extensions that use list format for float representation by converting a single float value into a list of floats."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure requirement is specified for the Float To Floats (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node specifies that it should run on the CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the Float To Floats (mtb) node an input or output node?",
        "answer": "The Float To Floats (mtb) node is not an output node; it is an intermediate node for data conversion purposes."
