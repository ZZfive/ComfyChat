        "question": "What does the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI adjusts the contrast of an image based on a specified factor, enhancing or reducing the difference between the light and dark areas of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI is 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the JWImageContrast node?",
        "answer": "The JWImageContrast node requires an 'image' input, which is the input image to adjust the contrast for, and a 'factor' input, which is a multiplier for adjusting the contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'image' input of the JWImageContrast node accept?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input of the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI accepts data of type 'IMAGE' with Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'factor' input of the JWImageContrast node require?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input of the JWImageContrast node requires a 'FLOAT' type data, which is represented as 'float' in Python, to adjust the contrast."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'factor' input in the JWImageContrast node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'factor' input in the JWImageContrast node determines the degree of contrast adjustment. A factor greater than 1 increases contrast, while a factor less than 1 decreases it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned by the JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageContrast node in ComfyUI returns an image with adjusted contrast, which has data type 'IMAGE' and Python dtype 'torch.Tensor'."
