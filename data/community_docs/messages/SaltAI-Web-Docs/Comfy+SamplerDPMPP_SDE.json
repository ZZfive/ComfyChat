    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the SamplerDPMPP_SDE node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the SamplerDPMPP_SDE node is to generate a sampler for the DPM++ SDE model, adaptable to both CPU and GPU environments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for SamplerDPMPP_SDE?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_SDE requires inputs such as 'eta' (step size for the SDE solver), 's_noise' (level of noise), 'r' (ratio of noise reduction), and 'noise_device' (execution environment selection)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the SamplerDPMPP_SDE node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the SamplerDPMPP_SDE node is a sampler configured with specified parameters, represented as a SAMPLER object."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does SamplerDPMPP_SDE optimize its execution?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_SDE optimizes its execution by adapting to both CPU and GPU environments, selecting the appropriate hardware for sampling operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What method does SamplerDPMPP_SDE use to get the sampler?",
        "answer": "SamplerDPMPP_SDE uses the method 'get_sampler' to obtain the sampler, which initializes based on the input parameters such as 'eta', 's_noise', 'r', and 'noise_device'."
