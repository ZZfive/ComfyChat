        "question": "What is the purpose of the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerProgress __Inspire node in ComfyUI is designed to iteratively sample and refine latent images over a series of steps, enabling progressive visualization of the sampling process and enhancing the quality and diversity of generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node does KSamplerProgress __Inspire replace?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify that the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node replaces any specific node. However, it should be noted that this node is designed for progressive sampling and refinement of latent images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What inputs does the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node require?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerProgress __Inspire node requires several inputs including `model`, `seed`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, `positive`, `negative`, `latent_image`, `denoise`, `noise_mode`, `interval`, and `omit_start_latent`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node control the noise application during the sampling process?",
        "answer": "Yes, the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node includes the `noise_mode` input, which influences the texture and detail of the generated images through various modes of noise application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node produce?",
        "answer": "The KSamplerProgress __Inspire node produces two main outputs: `latent`, which is the final latent image after the completion of the sampling process, and `progress_latent`, a collection of latent images captured at specified intervals during the sampling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the number of steps in the sampling process of the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The `steps` input determines the number of steps in the sampling process, directly influencing the refinement and progression of the latent image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node is `KSamplerProgress __Inspire`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `latent_image` input affect the output of the KSamplerProgress __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The `latent_image` input serves as the initial latent image to be refined through the sampling process, playing a crucial role as the starting point for the progressive refinement of the image."
