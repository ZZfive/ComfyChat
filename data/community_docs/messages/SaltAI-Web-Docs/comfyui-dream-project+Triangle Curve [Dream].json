        "question": "What is Triangle Curve [Dream] in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Triangle Curve [Dream] is a node in ComfyUI that generates a triangular waveform based on the current frame's time, allowing for linear ascending and descending animations within a specified periodicity and phase."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for Triangle Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The required input types for Triangle Curve [Dream] include frame_counter (used to calculate current time), max_value (peak of waveform), min_value (trough of waveform), periodicity_seconds (duration for one complete cycle), and phase (adjusts starting point within cycle)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Triangle Curve [Dream] adjust the phase of the waveform?",
        "answer": "Triangle Curve [Dream] adjusts the phase of the waveform using the phase parameter, which shifts the starting point of the wave within its cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of Triangle Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The output types of Triangle Curve [Dream] are FLOAT (calculated float value of the triangle wave) and INT (integer representation of the calculated triangle wave value, rounded to the nearest whole number)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does Triangle Curve [Dream] belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Triangle Curve [Dream] belongs to the Dream/animation/curves category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Triangle Curve [Dream] contribute to animation creation?",
        "answer": "Triangle Curve [Dream] contributes to animation creation by generating cyclic animations with a clear, predictable triangular waveform."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type supported by Triangle Curve [Dream]?",
        "answer": "The infra type supported by Triangle Curve [Dream] is CPU."
