        "question": "What is the Text Concatenate (JPS) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate (JPS) node in ComfyUI is designed to merge multiple text inputs into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate the texts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Text Concatenate (JPS) node handle multiple text inputs?",
        "answer": "The node appends each text input to the previous ones with the specified delimiter in between, allowing for flexible text manipulation and aggregation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input defines the separator used in the concatenated string in the Text Concatenate (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The `delimiter` input specifies the type of delimiter to use between text inputs, such as a space or comma, which influences how the concatenated text is formatted."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used to join several strings in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate (JPS) node can be used to join several strings in ComfyUI, enabling the creation of concatenated strings from various inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs of the Text Concatenate (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs of the Text Concatenate (JPS) node include `text1`, `text2`, `text3`, `text4`, and `text5`, which are the text inputs to be concatenated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Text Concatenate (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Text Concatenate (JPS) node is a resulting string after concatenating the given text inputs with the specified delimiter, denoted as `text`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of text inputs that can be concatenated directly by the Text Concatenate (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Text Concatenate (JPS) node can directly concatenate up to five text inputs (`text1` through `text5`), each being optional."
