        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltCLIPSegMasking node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node in ComfyUI is designed for batch processing of images to generate segmentation masks based on textual descriptions using the CLIPSeg model."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used for batch image CLIPSeg masking?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node can be used for batch image CLIPSeg masking in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input does SaltCLIPSegMasking require for image segmentation?",
        "answer": "SaltCLIPSegMasking requires a batch of images (`images`) and an optional textual description (`text`) as inputs for segmentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the `images` input in SaltCLIPSegMasking expect?",
        "answer": "The `images` input in SaltCLIPSegMasking expects a batch of images with the Comfy dtype `IMAGE` and Python dtype `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SaltCLIPSegMasking generate as output and in what format?",
        "answer": "SaltCLIPSegMasking generates segmentation masks corresponding to the input images (`masks`) in the `MASK` format and RGB representations of the segmentation masks (`mask_images`) in the `IMAGE` format, both using torch.Tensor for Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What optional input does SaltCLIPSegMasking have for using a pre-loaded CLIPSeg model?",
        "answer": "SaltCLIPSegMasking has an optional input `clipseg_model` for using a pre-loaded CLIPSeg model and processor."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what category is the SaltCLIPSegMasking node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltCLIPSegMasking node is classified under `SALT/Masking` category in ComfyUI."
