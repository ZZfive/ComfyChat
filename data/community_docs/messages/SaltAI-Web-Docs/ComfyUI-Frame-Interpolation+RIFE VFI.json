        "question": "What is the RIFE VFI node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RIFE VFI node in ComfyUI is designed for video frame interpolation, using deep learning models to predict and generate intermediate frames between existing ones in a video sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the RIFE VFI node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RIFE VFI node belongs to the 'ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/VFI' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the multiplier input affect the output of the RIFE VFI node?",
        "answer": "The multiplier input in the RIFE VFI node defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly influencing the smoothness of the output video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the clear_cache_after_n_frames input in the RIFE VFI node?",
        "answer": "The clear_cache_after_n_frames input in the RIFE VFI node indicates after how many frames the cache should be cleared to prevent memory overflow, optimizing resource usage during the processing of frame interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What checkpoint name is recommended for use in the RIFE VFI node?",
        "answer": "The recommended checkpoint names for use in the RIFE VFI node are 'rife47' and 'rife49'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are commonly used in conjunction with the RIFE VFI node for video processing?",
        "answer": "The RIFE VFI node is commonly used in conjunction with the VHS_VideoCombine, ImpactImageBatchToImageList, and SaveAnimatedWEBP nodes for video processing in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the scale_factor input control in the RIFE VFI node?",
        "answer": "The scale_factor input in the RIFE VFI node determines the scale factor for resizing frames during the interpolation process, affecting the resolution of the output frames generated by the RIFE VFI node."
