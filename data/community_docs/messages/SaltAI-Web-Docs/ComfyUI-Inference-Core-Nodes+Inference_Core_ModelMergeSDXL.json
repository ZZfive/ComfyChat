        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node designed for?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node is designed to merge two distinct model architectures into a single cohesive model, focusing on integrating various components such as input, middle, and output blocks along with specific transformer elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What categories does Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL belong to?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL belongs to the 'advanced/model_merging' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which two models does the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node merge?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node merges the first model, represented by `model1`, and the second model, represented by `model2`, into a single model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `model1` input in the Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The `model1` input represents the first model to be merged and plays a crucial role in the combined model's architecture and output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `time_embed.` input in Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL?",
        "answer": "The `time_embed.` input adjusts the time embedding layer's influence in the merged model, affecting temporal aspects of the model's processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `input_blocks.i` input influence the merged model in Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL?",
        "answer": "The `input_blocks.i` input controls the blending of the i-th input block from both models, determining the initial processing of inputs, influencing the initial stages of data processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL output?",
        "answer": "Inference_Core_ModelMergeSDXL outputs a merged model, represented as `model`, which is the result of integrating two input models, embodying the combined features and capabilities of both."
