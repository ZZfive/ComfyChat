        "question": "What is the main purpose of the CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced node?",
        "answer": "CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced is designed for advanced text encoding using the CLIP model, allowing for the customization of token normalization and weight interpretation while encoding multiple inputs simultaneously."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `clip` input represent in CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced?",
        "answer": "The `clip` input represents the CLIP model used for encoding. It is crucial for interpreting the input text into embeddings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced handle multiple inputs?",
        "answer": "CLIPEncodeMultipleAdvanced can handle multiple inputs based on the `inputs_len` input, which specifies the number of inputs to encode and allows the node to generate a list of conditionings."
