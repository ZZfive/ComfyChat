        "question": "What is the purpose of the VAE Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VAE Switch (JPS) node is designed to select and output one of several provided Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models based on an integer selection input, facilitating dynamic switching between different VAE models within a pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node category does the VAE Switch (JPS) belong to?",
        "answer": "The VAE Switch (JPS) node belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the 'select' input for the VAE Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the 'select' input for the VAE Switch (JPS) node is 'INT' in Comfy dtype and 'int' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VAE Switch (JPS) node determine which VAE model to output?",
        "answer": "The VAE Switch (JPS) node determines which VAE model to output based on the 'select' input, where each integer value corresponds to a specific VAE model input."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the VAE Switch (JPS) node accept more than one VAE model input?",
        "answer": "Yes, the VAE Switch (JPS) node can accept up to five VAE model inputs, which are 'vae_i', where 'i' can range from 1 to 5."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VAE Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VAE Switch (JPS) node is denoted as 'vae_out', which represents the selected VAE model based on the 'select' input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the VAE Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure requirement for the VAE Switch (JPS) node is 'CPU'."
