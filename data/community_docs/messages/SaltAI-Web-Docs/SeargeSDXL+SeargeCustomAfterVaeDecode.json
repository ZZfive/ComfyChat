        "question": "What is the `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node in ComfyUI is designed to process the output of a VAE decoding stage, specifically handling custom outputs, and providing a flexible mechanism to integrate custom processing or adjustments post VAE decoding."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` retrieve from the custom output?",
        "answer": "`SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` retrieves the custom output, expected to contain VAE decoded data along with any additional custom parameters or results that need further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node include `image`, which is the final processed image, potentially post-processed depending on the presence of such steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype is associated with the `image` output of the `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype associated with the `image` output of the `SeargeCustomAfterVaeDecode` node is `Union[torch.Tensor, None]`."
