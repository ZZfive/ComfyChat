    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for ImageContainerInheritanceSum?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ImageContainerInheritanceSum include 'images_a' and 'images_b' of type IMAGE, 'red', 'green', 'blue' of type INT, 'alpha' of type FLOAT, 'container_size_type' of type COMBO[STRING], and 'method' of type COMBO[STRING]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ImageContainerInheritanceSum calculate the width and height of the resulting composite image?",
        "answer": "ImageContainerInheritanceSum calculates the width and height based on the input parameters and the selected 'container_size_type'. It can sum both width and height, or either width or height depending on the chosen method."
