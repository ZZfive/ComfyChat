        "question": "What does the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node in ComfyUI is designed to convert normalized amplitude values from audio signals into masks, integrating audio data with visual elements to enable dynamic adjustments to visual content based on audio input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node is `NormalizedAmplitudeToMask`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node?",
        "answer": "The category of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node is `KJNodes/audio`, indicating it belongs to the audio-related nodes in ComfyUI's KJNodes category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `normalized_amp` input of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node represent?",
        "answer": "The `normalized_amp` input represents the normalized amplitude values from audio signals, typically in the range [0, 1], which serve as the basis for generating masks in the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the size of the mask in the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node?",
        "answer": "The `size` input determines the size of the mask in the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node, allowing control over the scale of the visual effect generated from the audio amplitude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `shape` input allow you to customize in the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node?",
        "answer": "The `shape` input allows you to customize the shape of the mask, providing options such as 'none', 'circle', 'square', and 'triangle' to produce various visual outcomes based on the audio input."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the result of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node outputted?",
        "answer": "The output of the NormalizedAmplitudeToMask node is a mask generated from the normalized amplitude values, where the amplitude information is visually encoded. Its comfy dtype is `MASK`, and it is represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python."
