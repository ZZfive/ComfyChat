        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images for depth estimation tasks by adapting them based on the specified environment (indoor or outdoor) using the Zoe Depth Anything Detector model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node requires an `image` as the primary input for depth estimation preprocessing. Optionally, it can also take `environment` (indoor or outdoor) and `resolution` as inputs to influence the choice of pretrained model and the detail level of the depth estimation, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the environment input affect the preprocessing in the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `environment` input specifies whether the image is from an indoor or outdoor setting, which influences the choice of pretrained model for depth estimation, ensuring the model is tailored to the specific environmental conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What resolution adjustment does the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node offer?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node allows for the adjustment of the resolution of the output image, which can affect the detail level of the depth estimation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node output?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node outputs a processed image, which is the result of the depth estimation preprocessing, with enhanced features ready for further analysis or use."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class is responsible for preprocessing in the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Zoe_Depth_Anything_Preprocessor class is responsible for preprocessing images in the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node. It utilizes the ZoeDepthAnythingDetector model to preprocess images for depth estimation based on the specified environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is recommended for the Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_Zoe_DepthAnythingPreprocessor node recommends using the GPU infrastructure for optimal performance during the depth estimation preprocessing task."
