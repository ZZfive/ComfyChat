        "question": "What is the purpose of the ImageListToImageBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageListToImageBatch node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a list of images into a single batched image tensor, ensuring all images have the same dimensions through upsampling if necessary. This facilitates batch processing of images by consolidating multiple images into a unified tensor format."
    },
    {
        "question": "In ComfyUI, which node can merge multiple image tensors into a single batched tensor?",
        "answer": "In ComfyUI, the ImageListToImageBatch node merges multiple image tensors into a single batched tensor by ensuring all images have the same dimensions through upsampling if necessary."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the input of the ImageListToImageBatch node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the input of the ImageListToImageBatch node is `List[torch.Tensor]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageListToImageBatch node ensure that all images in a batch have the same dimensions in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageListToImageBatch node ensures all images in a batch have the same dimensions by upsampling images with different dimensions to match those of the reference image in the batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes are commonly used together with the ImageListToImageBatch node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes together with ImageListToImageBatch in ComfyUI include VHS_VideoCombine, RIFE VFI, ImageUpscaleWithModel, Reroute, and ImageSelector."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the ImageListToImageBatch node an input or output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageListToImageBatch node is not an output node; it is an operation node that transforms a list of images into a batched image tensor in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageListToImageBatch node output in ComfyUI and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The ImageListToImageBatch node outputs a single batched image tensor, and its data type is `torch.Tensor` in ComfyUI."
