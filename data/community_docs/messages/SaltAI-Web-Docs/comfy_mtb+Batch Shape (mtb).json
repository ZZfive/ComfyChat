        "question": "What does the Batch Shape (mtb) node generate?",
        "answer": "The Batch Shape (mtb) node generates a batch of 2D shapes with optional shading, offering a creative tool for experimental design and visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the number of shapes to generate in the batch?",
        "answer": "The `count` input specifies the number of shapes to generate in the batch, affecting the overall output volume."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of shapes can be generated by the Batch Shape (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Batch Shape (mtb) node can generate Box, Circle, Diamond, or Tube shapes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the image size inputs for the Batch Shape (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `image_width` and `image_height` inputs set the size of the generated image, defining the canvas dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Batch Shape (mtb) node allow customization of visual scale?",
        "answer": "The Batch Shape (mtb) node allows for customization of the visual scale through the `shape_size` input, which controls the size of the generated shapes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input influences the depth and dimension of shapes in the images?",
        "answer": "The `shade_color` input sets the color used for shading, adding depth and dimension to the shapes within the generated images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the horizontal and vertical shading offset in the Batch Shape (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The horizontal and vertical shading offset are determined by the `shadex` and `shadey` inputs, respectively, which influence the shading direction in the generated images."
