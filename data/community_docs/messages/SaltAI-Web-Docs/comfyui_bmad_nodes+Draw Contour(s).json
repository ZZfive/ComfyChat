        "question": "What is the Draw Contours node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Draw Contours node in ComfyUI is designed for visualizing contours on images by drawing them over the original image, allowing for customization of the contour visualization to enhance interpretability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the thickness parameter in the Draw Contours node do?",
        "answer": "The thickness parameter in the Draw Contours node specifies the thickness of the contour lines. A negative value indicates that the contours should be filled."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the color parameter for contour lines specified in the Draw Contours node?",
        "answer": "The color parameter for contour lines in the Draw Contours node utilizes the `COLOR` comfy dtype, represented as a tuple of three integers in Python (e.g., `Tuple[int, int, int]`), specifying the red, green, and blue components of the color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does a negative value for the index_to_draw parameter in the Draw Contours node mean?",
        "answer": "A negative value for the index_to_draw parameter in the Draw Contours node, specifically -1, indicates that all contours should be drawn on the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the Draw Contours node produce?",
        "answer": "The Draw Contours node produces an image output with the specified contours drawn over it, enhancing visual analysis of contours."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can be used to visualize contours on images?",
        "answer": "The Draw Contour(s) node in ComfyUI can be used to visualize contours on images by drawing them over the original image, providing customization options for contour visualization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Draw Contours node control the visibility of specific contours?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Draw Contours node allows controlling the visibility of specific contours through the index_to_draw parameter, specifying which contour from the collection should be drawn on the image."
