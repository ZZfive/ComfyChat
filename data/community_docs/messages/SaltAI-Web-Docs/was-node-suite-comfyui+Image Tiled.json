        "question": "What is the purpose of the Image Tiled node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Image Tiled node in ComfyUI is designed to process an image by dividing it into a specified number of smaller, equally-sized tiles to facilitate image analysis or manipulation tasks that require focusing on smaller sections of an image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input image in the context of the Image Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The input image is the source image that will be divided into smaller tiles. This parameter is crucial as it determines the image to be tiled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 'num_tiles' parameter in the Image Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The 'num_tiles' parameter specifies the number of tiles the input image should be divided into. This parameter directly influences the granularity of the tiling process, affecting both the number and size of the resulting tiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Tiled node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Tiled node is a collection of smaller, equally-sized tiles derived from the input image. These tiles can be individually analyzed or manipulated further."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type handled by the Image Tiled node for the image input and output?",
        "answer": "The Image Tiled node handles `IMAGE` as the data type for both input and output in Comfy's data type system, and `torch.Tensor` as the corresponding Python data type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name associated with the Image Tiled functionality in the WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the Image Tiled functionality in the WAS Suite is `WAS_Image_Tile_Batch`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Image Tiled node belong to within Comfy's suite of functions?",
        "answer": "The Image Tiled node belongs to the category of 'WAS Suite/Image/Process' within Comfy's suite of functions."
