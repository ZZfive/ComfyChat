        "question": "What is the Image Select Color node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Image Select Color node in ComfyUI is designed to filter and highlight pixels within a specified color range in an image, which is useful for color-based segmentation or identifying objects of a specific color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Select Color node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Select Color node include an `image` of dtype `PIL.Image`, and the RGB components (`red`, `green`, `blue`) of the target color and the `variance` as integers to define the color range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Image Select Color node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Image Select Color node is an image of dtype `PIL.Image`, where only pixels within the specified color range are highlighted, and others are set to black."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can be used for color-based segmentation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "For color-based segmentation in ComfyUI, the `Image Select Color` node can be used which highlights pixels within a specific color range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Select Color node process the image based on the input parameters?",
        "answer": "The Image Select Color node processes the image by highlighting only the pixels that fall within the defined color range specified by the RGB values and the given variance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default variance value and its function in the Image Select Color node?",
        "answer": "The default variance value in the Image Select Color node is 10, and its function is to define the tolerance for what is considered a match to the target color, allowing for slight variations."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category of ComfyUI does the Image Select Color node belong?",
        "answer": "The Image Select Color node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Image/Process' category in ComfyUI."
