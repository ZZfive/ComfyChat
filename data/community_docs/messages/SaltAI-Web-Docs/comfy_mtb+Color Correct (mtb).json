        "question": "What is the class name for Color Correct (mtb) in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name for Color Correct (mtb) in ComfyUI is `Color Correct (mtb)`, under the category `mtb/image processing`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Color Correct (mtb) node in ComfyUI primarily adjust?",
        "answer": "The Color Correct (mtb) node in ComfyUI primarily adjusts gamma, contrast, exposure, hue, saturation, and value to enhance or modify the visual appearance of images."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameter in Color Correct (mtb) determines whether the color values should be constrained within a certain range?",
        "answer": "The `clamp` input parameter in Color Correct (mtb) determines whether the color values should be constrained within a certain range, particularly ensuring they do not exceed the allowable range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'gamma' input parameter in the Color Correct (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'gamma' input parameter in the Color Correct (mtb) node adjusts the gamma value of the image, thereby affecting the luminance or overall brightness and darkness of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Color Correct (mtb) node adjust the contrast of an image?",
        "answer": "The Color Correct (mtb) node adjusts the contrast of an image through the 'contrast' input parameter, which modifies the contrast levels making the dark areas of the image darker and the light areas lighter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input allows for adjusting the saturation of an image in ComfyUI's Color Correct (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'saturation' input parameter in the Color Correct (mtb) node of ComfyUI allows for adjusting the saturation of an image, influencing the intensity of the colors, making them more vivid or more muted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'hue' parameter in the Color Correct (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'hue' parameter in the Color Correct (mtb) node alters the hue of the image, changing the overall color tone without affecting the brightness or saturation levels."
