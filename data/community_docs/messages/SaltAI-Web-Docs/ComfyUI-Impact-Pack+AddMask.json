        "question": "What is the purpose of the AddMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddMask node in ComfyUI is designed to combine two mask inputs into a single mask output by merging the features or areas covered by both input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the AddMask node are `mask1` and `mask2`, both of which are of the `MASK` data type in Comfy and `torch.Tensor` in Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mask1` input represent in the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The `mask1` input represents the first mask for the addition operation, serving as the base to which the second mask will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the AddMask node is a single `mask` of the `MASK` data type in Comfy and `torch.Tensor` in Python, representing the combined features of the two input masks."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can you find the AddMask node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddMask node can be found in the 'ImpactPack/Operation' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What common node can be used alongside the AddMask node for mask manipulation?",
        "answer": "The InvertMask node is a common node that can be used alongside the AddMask node for mask manipulation in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class in the source code represents the AddMask node?",
        "answer": "The class that represents the AddMask node in the source code is `AddMask`."
