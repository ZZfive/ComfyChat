        "question": "What is the purpose of the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node?",
        "answer": "The `promptComposerTextMultiple` node is designed to compose a text prompt by combining multiple text inputs, each with an associated weight, to dynamically create prompts with adjustable significance for text elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `promptComposerTextMultiple` node belongs to the category `AI WizArt/Prompt Composer Tools` within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many text inputs can the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node handle?",
        "answer": "The `promptComposerTextMultiple` node can handle up to ten text inputs, each with an associated weight."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `active` input in the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node?",
        "answer": "The `active` input is a boolean that activates or deactivates the composition of the prompt. When false, the node may ignore the text inputs and weights, resulting in an empty or default prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node?",
        "answer": "The output of the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node is a composed text prompt (`text_out`), which results from the combination and weighting of the provided text inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of the weight inputs in the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node?",
        "answer": "The weight inputs determine the significance of the corresponding text inputs in the composed prompt, allowing for a flexible and weighted composition of text elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type used by the `promptComposerTextMultiple` node?",
        "answer": "The `promptComposerTextMultiple` node uses the infra type `CPU`."
