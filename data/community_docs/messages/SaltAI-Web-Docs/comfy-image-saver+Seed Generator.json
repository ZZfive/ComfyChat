        "question": "What is the Seed Generator node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node in ComfyUI is designed to provide a deterministic or randomized seed value for various operations within the image saving process, ensuring repeatability or diversity in output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Seed Generator node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node belongs to the 'ImageSaverTools/utils' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type required by the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node in ComfyUI requires an input type of 'INT' for the seed parameter, allowing users to specify a seed value for generating deterministic outputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Seed Generator node handle the seed parameter if it is not provided?",
        "answer": "If the seed parameter is not provided to the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI, a default value is used, ensuring repeatability or randomness in operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Seed Generator node in ComfyUI outputs an integer representing the seed value, which can be used to initialize random number generators or other processes requiring a seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some common nodes that can use the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Some common nodes that can use the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI include KSampler, FaceDetailer, UltimateSDUpscaleNoUpscale, Reroute, KSamplerAdvanced (Inspire), and DetailerForEach."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for the Seed Generator node in ComfyUI is CPU."
