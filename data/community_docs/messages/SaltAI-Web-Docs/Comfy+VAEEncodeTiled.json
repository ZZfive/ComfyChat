        "question": "What is VAEEncodeTiled?",
        "answer": "VAEEncodeTiled is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for encoding images into a latent space representation, specifically handling images in a tiled manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does VAEEncodeTiled belong to?",
        "answer": "VAEEncodeTiled belongs to the '_for_testing' category within ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'pixels' parameter represent in VAEEncodeTiled?",
        "answer": "The 'pixels' parameter in VAEEncodeTiled represents the image data to be encoded. It is crucial for defining the visual content that will be transformed into a latent representation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'vae' parameter used for in VAEEncodeTiled?",
        "answer": "The 'vae' parameter in VAEEncodeTiled specifies the Variational Autoencoder model used for the encoding process. It determines how the image data is transformed into the latent space."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does VAEEncodeTiled handle larger images?",
        "answer": "VAEEncodeTiled handles larger images by dividing them into smaller tiles using the 'tile_size' parameter, encoding each tile separately, and then combining the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of VAEEncodeTiled?",
        "answer": "The output of VAEEncodeTiled is a latent space representation of the input image, encoded in a tiled manner. It captures the essential features of the image in a compressed form."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for using VAEEncodeTiled?",
        "answer": "The recommended infrastructure type for using VAEEncodeTiled is 'GPU'."
