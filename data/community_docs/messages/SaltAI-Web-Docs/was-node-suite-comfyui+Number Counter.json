        "question": "What is the purpose of the Number Counter node in ComfyUI's WAS Suite?",
        "answer": "The Number Counter node is designed to perform various numerical operations such as incrementing, decrementing, and adjusting numbers within specified ranges, based on a unique identifier and mode of operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Number Counter node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Number Counter node belongs to the 'WAS Suite/Number' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'number_type' input in the Number Counter node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'number_type' input in the Number Counter node specifies whether the number to be manipulated is an integer or a float, affecting the precision and nature of the operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output number represented in the Number Counter node after an operation?",
        "answer": "After an operation, the Number Counter node outputs the resulting number in three types: `NUMBER`, which is an integer or float depending on the input, `FLOAT`, which is always in float format, and `INT`, which is always in integer format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'reset_bool' input play in the Number Counter node?",
        "answer": "The 'reset_bool' input in the Number Counter node acts as a flag to reset the counter to the 'start' value, enabling reinitialization of the numerical operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Number Counter node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Number Counter node include 'number_type', which specifies the type of number (integer or float), 'mode', which determines the operation (increment, decrement, increment_to_stop, or decrement_to_stop), 'start' and 'stop' values that set the starting and target values for the operation, and 'step', which is the increment or decrement step size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an example of a common node that can be used with the Number Counter node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "An example of a common node that can be used in conjunction with the Number Counter node in ComfyUI is the 'Load Image Batch' node."
