        "question": "What is the purpose of the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a schedule for prompts based on a given weights strategy, adjusting the prompts to fit the specified frame count and adding starting or ending frames if required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `weights_strategy` input represent in the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node?",
        "answer": "The `weights_strategy` input defines the strategy for distributing weights across frames, including the total number of frames, and whether to add starting or ending frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the `prompt` input play in the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node?",
        "answer": "The `prompt` input represents the initial prompt or series of prompts, separated by new lines, to be scheduled according to the weights strategy, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the prompt content over the frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `prompt_schedule` output from the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node indicate?",
        "answer": "The `prompt_schedule` output is the generated schedule of prompts, formatted as a string, detailing the prompt assignments for each frame based on the weights strategy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node adjust prompts to fit the animation frame count?",
        "answer": "Yes, the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node can adjust prompts to fit the specified frame count, and it adds starting or ending frames if required to ensure alignment with the animation or image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is responsible for tailoring prompt distribution over a frame sequence?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node in ComfyUI is responsible for tailoring prompt distribution over a frame sequence, ensuring alignment with the animation or image generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type supports the IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The IPAdapterPromptScheduleFromWeightsStrategy node in ComfyUI is supported on the CPU infrastructure type."
