        "question": "What does the JWImageResizeByFactor node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The JWImageResizeByFactor node is used to resize an image by a specified factor in ComfyUI, allowing flexible image scaling with various interpolation modes to maintain image quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the JWImageResizeByFactor node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the JWImageResizeByFactor node are an `image` (torch.Tensor), a `factor` (float) specifying the scaling factor, and an `interpolation_mode` (str) determining the interpolation method."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `factor` input affect the output of the JWImageResizeByFactor node?",
        "answer": "The `factor` input in the JWImageResizeByFactor node specifies the scaling factor for resizing the image; a factor greater than 1 enlarges the image, while a factor less than 1 shrinks it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `interpolation_mode` input in the JWImageResizeByFactor node?",
        "answer": "The `interpolation_mode` input in the JWImageResizeByFactor node determines the method used for interpolating between pixel values during the resize operation, affecting the quality and appearance of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the JWImageResizeByFactor node represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the JWImageResizeByFactor node represents the resized image, which has been scaled by the specified factor and using the chosen interpolation mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type associated with the JWImageResizeByFactor node?",
        "answer": "The infra type associated with the JWImageResizeByFactor node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the JWImageResizeByFactor node an output node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "No, the JWImageResizeByFactor node is not an output node in ComfyUI."
