    {
        "question": "What does the ISNetLoader node do?",
        "answer": "The ISNetLoader node loads ISNet models, allowing selection based on a specific model name or overriding with an alternative model if specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ISNetLoader?",
        "answer": "The required input types for ISNetLoader include 'model_name' and 'model_override'. 'model_name' specifies the ISNet model to load, while 'model_override' allows specifying an alternative model."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does 'model_override' enhance ISNetLoader's functionality?",
        "answer": "'model_override' in ISNetLoader enables the loading of an alternative ISNet model, providing flexibility in model selection without altering the core configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does ISNetLoader provide?",
        "answer": "ISNetLoader outputs the loaded ISNet model, which is ready for use in image segmentation tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python dtype does 'model_override' use?",
        "answer": "'model_override' in ISNetLoader uses 'str' as its Python dtype."
