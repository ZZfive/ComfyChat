        "question": "What is the category of the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The DF_Floor node belongs to the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Functions/Converters` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the DF_Floor node is `Value`, which is a floating-point number that the node rounds down."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'Value' parameter represent in the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The 'Value' parameter in the DF_Floor node represents the floating-point number that is to be rounded down to its nearest lower integer."

    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the DF_Floor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the DF_Floor node is an integer (`int`), which represents the nearest lower integer value of the input floating-point number."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which function is responsible for the floor operation in the DF_Floor node?",
        "answer": "The function responsible for the floor operation in the DF_Floor node is `get_value`, which takes the input Value, rounds it down, and returns the nearest lower integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the source code of the DF_Floor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The source code of the DF_Floor node includes the definition of the `FloorNode` class, its `INPUT_TYPES` which defines the required `Value` field of type float, and the `get_value` function that performs the floor operation."
