        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node is designed to apply a stack of multiple ControlNets to a given set of conditioning data, enabling complex and layered modifications for more nuanced and controlled generation processes in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category can the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node be found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node can be found under the category 'üß© Comfyroll Studio/‚ú® Essential/üïπÔ∏è ControlNet' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node include 'base_positive', 'base_negative', 'switch', and 'controlnet_stack'. 'base_positive' and 'base_negative' are initial conditioning data, 'switch' is a control to enable or disable the node, and 'controlnet_stack' is a list of ControlNets to apply sequentially."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'switch' input allow the user to do in the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node?",
        "answer": "The 'switch' input in the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node allows the user to enable or disable the application of the ControlNet stack. If set to 'Off', the node will bypass the application process and return the original conditioning data."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node process the 'controlnet_stack' input?",
        "answer": "The CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node processes the 'controlnet_stack' input by iterating through each ControlNet in the stack, applying them sequentially to modify the conditioning data based on the ControlNet's specifications and the provided image, strength, and percentage range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node return when 'switch' is set to 'Off'?",
        "answer": "When the 'switch' is set to 'Off', the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node returns the original 'base_positive' and 'base_negative' conditioning data along with a help URL."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'show_help' output of the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node, and what is its purpose?",
        "answer": "The 'show_help' output of the CR Apply Multi-ControlNet node provides a URL to help and additional information about the node's usage. Its purpose is to assist users with a detailed explanation of the node and its application."
