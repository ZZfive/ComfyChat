        "question": "What does the Human4D_Img2SMPL node convert 2D human images into?",
        "answer": "The Human4D_Img2SMPL node converts 2D human images into 3D representations using the SMPL model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the necessary input types for the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The necessary input types for the Human4D_Img2SMPL node include 'human4d_model', 'image', 'det_confidence_thresh', 'det_iou_thresh', 'det_batch_size', and 'hmr_batch_size'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'human4d_model' input play in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The 'human4d_model' encapsulates the configurations and models necessary for detecting humans in images and generating their 3D SMPL representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Human4D_Img2SMPL node use the 'image' input?",
        "answer": "The 'image' input contains human figures to be transformed into 3D SMPL models for human detection and pose estimation by the Human4D_Img2SMPL node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'det_confidence_thresh' parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The 'det_confidence_thresh' parameter in the Human4D_Img2SMPL node filters out detections with low confidence, ensuring only high-confidence human figures are processed for 3D modeling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types provided by the Human4D_Img2SMPL node?",
        "answer": "The Human4D_Img2SMPL node outputs 'smpl_multiple_subjects', which is a comprehensive 3D representation of multiple human subjects derived from 2D images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure requirement does the Human4D_Img2SMPL node have?",
        "answer": "The Human4D_Img2SMPL node requires GPU infrastructure for its processing and transformations from 2D human images to 3D representations."
