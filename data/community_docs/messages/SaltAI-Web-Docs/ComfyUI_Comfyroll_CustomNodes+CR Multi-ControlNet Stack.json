        "question": "What is the CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node is designed to create a stack of ControlNet configurations, each with its own switch, allowing for the dynamic application of multiple ControlNet effects based on specified conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node facilitate the layering of ControlNet adjustments?",
        "answer": "The CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node facilitates the layering of ControlNet adjustments by enabling the conditional application of various ControlNet configurations to images, enhancing flexibility and control in image manipulation workflows."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the switch_1 input do in CR Multi-ControlNet Stack?",
        "answer": "The switch_1 input determines whether the first ControlNet configuration in the stack is active ('On') or inactive ('Off')."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the controlnet_strength_1 input expect?",
        "answer": "The controlnet_strength_1 input expects a FLOAT data type in ComfyUI, which corresponds to the Python dtype `float`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the starting percentage where the first ControlNet effect begins to apply in the CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node?",
        "answer": "The start_percent_1 input determines the starting percentage of the image where the first ControlNet effect begins to apply in the CR Multi-ControlNet Stack node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input is used to provide the ControlNet configuration stack in CR Multi-ControlNet Stack?",
        "answer": "The 'controlnet_stack' input is used to provide a list of additional ControlNet configurations to be applied in CR Multi-ControlNet Stack."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output does CR Multi-ControlNet Stack use to provide the compiled list of ControlNet configurations?",
        "answer": "CR Multi-ControlNet Stack provides the compiled list of ControlNet configurations through the `CONTROLNET_STACK` output."
