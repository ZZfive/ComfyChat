        "question": "What is ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel is a node in ComfyUI designed to load and prepare AnimateLCM-I2V motion models for animation processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel ensure?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel ensures that the selected motion model is compatible with the AnimateLCM-I2V format and includes an image encoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel requires a model_name parameter, which specifies the name of the motion model to be loaded and must be compatible with the AnimateLCM-I2V format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional input types for ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel optionally accepts ad_settings for customizing the Animate Diff process applied to the motion model."

    {
        "question": "What are the output types of ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel outputs two types: MOTION_MODEL, which is the loaded motion model ready for animation processes, and encoder_only, which is a version of the motion model that includes only the encoder."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel verify the compatibility of the motion model?",
        "answer": "ADE_LoadAnimateLCMI2VModel verifies compatibility by checking if the motion model's format is AnimateLCM-I2V and ensuring it contains an image encoder."
