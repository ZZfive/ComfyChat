    {
        "question": "How does ImageTransformCropCorners handle corner rounding?",
        "answer": "ImageTransformCropCorners uses supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) and rounded rectangle drawing to achieve corner rounding, allowing for smooth edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of ImageTransformCropCorners?",
        "answer": "The output type of ImageTransformCropCorners is IMAGE, which are the images after applying the corner cropping and rounding."
