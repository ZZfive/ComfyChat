        "question": "What is the MasksToMaskList node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "MasksToMaskList is a node in ComfyUI categorized under ImpactPack/Operation, which transforms a collection of individual masks into a list of masks by applying a 3D mask transformation to each one."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the MasksToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the MasksToMaskList node is to prepare mask data for further processing or analysis within a pipeline by transforming masks into a standardized list format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'masks' parameter represent in MasksToMaskList?",
        "answer": "The 'masks' parameter in MasksToMaskList represents the collection of masks to be transformed, which is crucial for the node's operation as it provides the raw data that will be processed into a standardized list format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the MasksToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The output of the MasksToMaskList node is a list of masks, each transformed into a 3D format, ready for further processing or analysis within ComfyUI pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type for the MasksToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The infra type for the MasksToMaskList node is CPU, indicating it performs its operations on the central processing unit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the common nodes associated with the MasksToMaskList node?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes associated with MasksToMaskList. This information might be unknown or not documented."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the MasksToMaskList node handle a None type 'masks' input?",
        "answer": "If the 'masks' input is None, the MasksToMaskList node generates an empty mask, which is a zero tensor of size (64, 64) with a dtype of float32 and device set to CPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the MasksToMaskList node do with each mask in the input collection?",
        "answer": "For each mask in the input collection, the MasksToMaskList node applies a transformation to make it a 3D mask, which is then added to the resulting list."
