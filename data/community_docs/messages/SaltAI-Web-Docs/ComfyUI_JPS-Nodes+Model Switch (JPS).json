        "question": "What is the purpose of the Model Switch (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch (JPS) node is designed to dynamically select between multiple model inputs based on a specified selection criterion, facilitating the flexible integration and switching of different models within a workflow."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Model Switch (JPS) belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch (JPS) belongs to the 'JPS Nodes/Switches' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines which model the Model Switch (JPS) outputs?",
        "answer": "The 'select' parameter, an integer value, determines which model the Model Switch (JPS) outputs by directing the switch to output the corresponding model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the 'select' input accept in the Model Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'select' input accepts an integer value in the Model Switch (JPS) node, specifically 'Comfy dtype: INT' and 'Python dtype: int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many model inputs can be optionally connected to the Model Switch (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch (JPS) node can optionally connect up to five model inputs named 'model_1' to 'model_5'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output of the Model Switch (JPS) represent?",
        "answer": "The output of the Model Switch (JPS) node represents the selected model based on the 'select' parameter, with 'Comfy dtype: MODEL' and 'Python dtype: object'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the Model Switch (JPS) node designed to operate on?",
        "answer": "The Model Switch (JPS) node is designed to operate on 'CPU' infrastructure."
