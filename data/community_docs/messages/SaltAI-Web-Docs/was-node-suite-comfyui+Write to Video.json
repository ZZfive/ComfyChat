        "question": "What is the 'Write to Video' node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to Video' node in ComfyUI is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of video files from images, including writing individual images to a video, generating transition frames between images, adding still image delays, and configuring video properties like frame rate and resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the 'Write to Video' node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the 'Write to Video' node include 'image', 'transition_frames', 'image_delay_sec', 'fps', 'max_size', 'output_path', 'filename', and 'codec'. These inputs allow for the customization of the video creation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Write to Video' node handle image sizes?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to Video' node ensures that all images are uniformly scaled by specifying the maximum size for the images in the video. This is controlled by the 'max_size' parameter, which helps maintain consistent video quality and aspect ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the duration each image is displayed in the video created using the 'Write to Video' node?",
        "answer": "The duration for which each image is displayed in the video is determined by the 'image_delay_sec' parameter. This allows for the creation of still image delays and helps in controlling the pacing of the video content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node can be used for configuring video properties like frame rate when creating videos from images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to Video' node can be used for configuring video properties like frame rate when creating videos from images in ComfyUI. This node allows you to set parameters such as 'fps', which defines how many frames are displayed per second."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'codec' parameter in the 'Write to Video' node specify?",
        "answer": "The 'codec' parameter in the 'Write to Video' node specifies the codec used for encoding the video. Different codecs can affect the video's compatibility, size, and quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does the 'Write to Video' node provide in its output types?",
        "answer": "The 'Write to Video' node provides information on whether the image processing and video writing operations were successful, the full path to the created video file including its name, and the name of the created video file, which aids in identification and organization."
