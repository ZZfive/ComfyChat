        "question": "What is the purpose of the Lora Loader node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader node in ComfyUI is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to given models and CLIP instances, enhancing their capabilities or altering their behavior based on specified LoRA parameters and strengths."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name for the Lora Loader node?",
        "answer": "The class name for the Lora Loader node is `Lora Loader`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'model' input in the Lora Loader node?",
        "answer": "The 'model' input in the Lora Loader node is crucial for defining the base architecture of the model that will be enhanced or modified by the LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Lora Loader node modify the behavior of a CLIP instance?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader node modifies the behavior of a CLIP instance by applying LoRA adjustments based on the specified 'strength_clip' parameter, which influences the intensity of the modifications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function that the Lora Loader node uses to load LoRA adjustments?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader node uses the `load_lora` function to load LoRA adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes are commonly used with the Lora Loader in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes with the Lora Loader in ComfyUI include `CLIPTextEncode`, `VideoLinearCFGGuidance`, `KSampler`, `FaceDetailer`, `ModelSamplingDiscrete`, `KSamplerAdvanced`, and `ADE_AnimateDiffLoaderWithContext`."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what infrastructure type is the Lora Loader node primarily used?",
        "answer": "The Lora Loader node is primarily used in an infrastructure type `GPU`."
