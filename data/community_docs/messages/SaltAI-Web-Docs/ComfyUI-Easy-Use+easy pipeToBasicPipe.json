        "question": "What is the purpose of the easy pipeToBasicPipe node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The easy pipeToBasicPipe node in ComfyUI is designed to transform a complex pipeline configuration into a simplified basic pipeline structure, extracting essential components such as model, clip, vae, and conditioning information for further processing or analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the easy pipeToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The required input type for the easy pipeToBasicPipe node is `pipe`, which represents the complex pipeline configuration to be simplified. It has a Comfy dtype of `PIPE_LINE` and a Python dtype of `Dict[str, Any]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the easy pipeToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The output types of the easy pipeToBasicPipe node is `basic_pipe`, which is a simplified version of the input pipeline, containing only the essential components. Its Comfy dtype is `BASIC_PIPE` and the Python dtype is `Tuple[Any, ...]`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the easy pipeToBasicPipe node do with the `pipe` input?",
        "answer": "The easy pipeToBasicPipe node extracts the model, clip, vae, and conditioning information from the `pipe` input, which is the complex pipeline configuration, and repackages these components into a more streamlined `basic_pipe` format."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `pipe` parameter used in the easy pipeToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The `pipe` parameter in the easy pipeToBasicPipe node is used to represent the complex pipeline configuration that needs to be simplified. It determines the components to be extracted and included in the basic pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are considered as common nodes for the easy pipeToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The documentation for the easy pipeToBasicPipe node does not specify any common nodes associated with it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the easy pipeToBasicPipe node?",
        "answer": "The easy pipeToBasicPipe node has an infra type of `CPU`, indicating that it is designed to run efficiently on the CPU."
