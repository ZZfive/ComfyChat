    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the FromDetailerPipeSDXL node?",
        "answer": "The output types generated by the FromDetailerPipeSDXL node include the entire detailer pipe, model, clip, VAE, positive and negative conditioning elements, bounding box detector, SAM model, segmentation detector, detailer hook, as well as refiner model, clip, and conditioning elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is returned when the FromDetailerPipeSDXL node is applied to a detailer pipe in terms of the model component?",
        "answer": "When the FromDetailerPipeSDXL node is applied to a detailer pipe, the model component extracted from the detailer pipe is returned, having the Python dtype of `torch.nn.Module`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the `refiner_negative` output type described in terms of its functionality?",
        "answer": "The `refiner_negative` output type is described as the refiner negative conditioning element extracted from the detailer pipe by the FromDetailerPipeSDXL node."
