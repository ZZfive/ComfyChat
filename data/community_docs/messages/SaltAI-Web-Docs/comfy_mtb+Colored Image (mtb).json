        "question": "What is the Colored Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Colored Image (mtb) node is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to apply color transformations to images, enhancing or altering their visual appearance through various color adjustment techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters are required for the Colored Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The Colored Image (mtb) node requires three parameters: 'color', 'width', and 'height'. The 'color' parameter defines the primary color to be applied to the image, the 'width' parameter specifies the desired width of the output image, and the 'height' parameter sets the desired height of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types for the 'color' and size parameters in the Colored Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "In the Colored Image (mtb) node, the 'color' parameter has a Comfy dtype of 'COLOR' and a Python dtype of 'str'. The size parameters, 'width' and 'height', have Comfy dtypes of 'INT' and Python dtypes of 'int'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'foreground_image' parameter in the Colored Image (mtb) node allow for?",
        "answer": "The 'foreground_image' parameter in the Colored Image (mtb) node allows for the overlay of an image atop the colored background, adding complexity to the visual output by placing an image over the color-transformed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'foreground_mask' parameter play in the Colored Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The 'foreground_mask' parameter in the Colored Image (mtb) node specifies an alpha mask for the foreground image, determining the transparency and blending of the foreground image with the background color."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Colored Image (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Colored Image (mtb) node is an image that has been transformed by applying the specified color and background to the given mask, if any. The Comfy dtype of the output is 'IMAGE', and the Python dtype is 'torch.Tensor'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the Colored Image (mtb) node designed to run on?",
        "answer": "The Colored Image (mtb) node is designed to run on 'CPU' infrastructure, indicating that its processing is done using the computer's CPU rather than a GPU."
