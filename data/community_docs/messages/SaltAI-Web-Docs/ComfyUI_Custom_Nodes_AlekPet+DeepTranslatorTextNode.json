        "question": "What is the DeepTranslatorTextNode class designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The DeepTranslatorTextNode is designed to facilitate text translation across various languages, leveraging different translation services. It provides a streamlined interface for translating text with optional proxy support, abstracting the complexity of interacting with translation APIs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'from_translate' input play in the DeepTranslatorTextNode?",
        "answer": "The 'from_translate' input specifies the source language for translation or 'auto' to enable automatic language detection based on the text content. It is crucial for guiding the translation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the DeepTranslatorTextNode handle target language definition for translation?",
        "answer": "The 'to_translate' input in the DeepTranslatorTextNode defines the target language for the translation, determining the language into which the text will be translated."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the DeepTranslatorTextNode be used in environments with restricted internet access, and how?",
        "answer": "Yes, the DeepTranslatorTextNode can be used in environments with restricted internet access by setting the 'add_proxies' flag to True and providing proxy configuration details through the 'proxies' input, allowing translation requests to be facilitated through specified proxy servers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input does the 'auth_data' parameter of the DeepTranslatorTextNode require?",
        "answer": "The 'auth_data' input contains authentication data required by certain translation services, ensuring authorized access to their APIs. It is in the form of a dictionary."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input allows the selection of the translation service to be used by the DeepTranslatorTextNode?",
        "answer": "The 'service' input allows the selection of the translation service to be used, offering choices like 'GoogleTranslator', 'MyMemoryTranslator', and others, providing flexibility in choosing the translation provider."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the DeepTranslatorTextNode provide, and what is its significance?",
        "answer": "The DeepTranslatorTextNode provides a 'text' output, which is the translated text. This output represents the outcome of the translation process and is significant for further use in the ComfyUI workflow."
