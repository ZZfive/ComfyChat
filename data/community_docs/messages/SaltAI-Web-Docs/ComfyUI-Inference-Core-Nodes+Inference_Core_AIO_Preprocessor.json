        "question": "What is the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node designed to do?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is designed to streamline the preprocessing phase for a variety of input data types, specifically targeting the enhancement and preparation of data for subsequent processing or analysis within an AI-driven pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of input data is primarily expected by the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The primary input expected by the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is an 'image', represented as `IMAGE` in Comfy dtype and as `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'preprocessor' parameter affect the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node's operation?",
        "answer": "The 'preprocessor' parameter in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node specifies the particular preprocessing technique to be applied to the input image, allowing for a customizable preprocessing workflow that adapts to various needs and enhances the effectiveness of the data preparation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'resolution' parameter in Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node control?",
        "answer": "The 'resolution' parameter in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node defines the desired resolution for the output image after preprocessing, enabling control over the output quality and size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node is `IMAGE`, represented in Comfy dtype and as `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype, indicating the preprocessed image ready for further analysis or processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor belongs to the 'ControlNet Preprocessors' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node when the 'preprocessor' parameter is set to 'none'?",
        "answer": "When the 'preprocessor' parameter is set to 'none' in the Inference_Core_AIO_Preprocessor node, the node simply passes the image through without applying any preprocessing operations, returning the original image as is."
