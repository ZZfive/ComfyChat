        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node in ComfyUI is designed for selecting one of two conditioning inputs based on a selector input, facilitating dynamic control over which conditioning data is passed forward in a processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types of the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node?",
        "answer": "The required input types of the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node include 'input0' and 'input1', which are both 'CONDITIONING' types, and 'input_selector', which is an 'INT' type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'input_selector' in the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node control?",
        "answer": "The 'input_selector' in the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node is an integer selector that determines which of the two conditioning inputs ('input0' or 'input1') is passed forward. A value of 0 selects 'input0', while a value of 1 selects 'input1'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does SeargeConditioningMuxer2 provide?",
        "answer": "SeargeConditioningMuxer2 provides the 'output' type, which is a 'CONDITIONING' dtype, carrying forward the chosen conditioning context for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'output' of the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 represent?",
        "answer": "The 'output' of the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 represents the selected conditioning input, determined by the value of 'input_selector', for further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category does the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node falls under the 'Searge/_deprecated_/FlowControl' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of function does the SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node execute in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node executes a 'mux' function in ComfyUI, which selects one of two conditioning inputs based on the 'input_selector'."
