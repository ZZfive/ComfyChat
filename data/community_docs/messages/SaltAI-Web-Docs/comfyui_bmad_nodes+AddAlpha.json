        "question": "What is the purpose of the AddAlpha node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The AddAlpha node in ComfyUI is designed to add an alpha channel to RGB images, allowing for the manipulation of image transparency."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The class name of the AddAlpha node is `AddAlpha`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The category of the AddAlpha node is `Bmad/image`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the rgb_image input represent in the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The `rgb_image` input in the AddAlpha node represents the base RGB image to which an alpha channel will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the data types of the alpha input for the AddAlpha node?",
        "answer": "The alpha input in the AddAlpha node has a Comfy dtype of `IMAGE` and a Python dtype of `torch.Tensor`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the method parameter in the AddAlpha node determine?",
        "answer": "The `method` parameter in the AddAlpha node determines how the alpha channel is applied to the RGB image, either using the alpha channel as provided ('default') or inverting it (flexibility in transparency manipulation)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the AddAlpha node generate?",
        "answer": "The AddAlpha node generates an output of type `IMAGE`, which is the resulting image with an alpha channel added, enabling transparency manipulation."
