        "question": "What is the main purpose of the ImageMuxer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageMuxer node in ComfyUI is designed to select and output one image from a set of up to four input images based on a given selector index, which is essential for scenarios requiring dynamic image selection."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the ImageMuxer node?",
        "answer": "The ImageMuxer node is associated with the class name `ImageMuxer`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ImageMuxer node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageMuxer node is `IMAGE`, which is a `torch.Tensor` in Python, representing the selected image based on the input selector index."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the ImageMuxer node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageMuxer node belongs to the category `Art Venture/Utils` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `input_selector` in the ImageMuxer node?",
        "answer": "The `input_selector`, an integer index, determines which of the input images is selected for output in the ImageMuxer node, driving the dynamic selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the maximum number of images the ImageMuxer node can handle as input?",
        "answer": "The ImageMuxer node can handle up to four input images, which are dynamically selected based on the input selector index."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `UtilImageMuxer` class do in the source code of the ImageMuxer node?",
        "answer": "The `UtilImageMuxer` class in the source code of the ImageMuxer node defines the input types, return types, and the functionality for image selection based on the input selector index."
