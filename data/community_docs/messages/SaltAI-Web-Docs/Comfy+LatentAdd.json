        "question": "What is LatentAdd?",
        "answer": "LatentAdd is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for the addition of two latent representations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does LatentAdd belong to?",
        "answer": "LatentAdd belongs to the 'latent/advanced' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the LatentAdd node do?",
        "answer": "The LatentAdd node facilitates the combination of features or characteristics encoded in two latent representations by performing element-wise addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the LatentAdd node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the LatentAdd node are 'samples1' and 'samples2', both of type 'LATENT'. These inputs represent two sets of latent samples to be added together."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentAdd node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentAdd node is 'LATENT'. It returns a new set of latent samples that combine the features of both input samples through element-wise addition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the LatentAdd node combine the input features?",
        "answer": "The LatentAdd node combines the input features by performing element-wise addition between the two sets of latent samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what type of infrastructure is the LatentAdd node typically used?",
        "answer": "The LatentAdd node is typically used in GPU infrastructures."
