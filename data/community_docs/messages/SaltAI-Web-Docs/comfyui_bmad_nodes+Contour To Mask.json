        "question": "What is the purpose of the Contour To Mask node in Bmad/CV/Contour category?",
        "answer": "The Contour To Mask node is designed to convert a contour into a mask image, transforming the shape defined by the contour into a binary mask which can be used for various image processing tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input represent in the Contour To Mask node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input on the Contour To Mask node represents the input image on which the contour is to be drawn, serving as the base for the mask creation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input type defines the shape that will be filled in the mask in the Contour To Mask node?",
        "answer": "The contour input type defines the shape that will be filled in the mask in the Contour To Mask node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `output_format` parameter in the Contour To Mask node?",
        "answer": "The `output_format` parameter in the Contour To Mask node specifies the desired output format for the mask image, allowing for flexibility in how the mask is utilized downstream."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the format of the resulting mask image output by the Contour To Mask node?",
        "answer": "The resulting mask image output by the Contour To Mask node is in a torch.Tensor format, represented as the `image` output type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can transform a contour into a binary mask image in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Contour To Mask node can transform a contour into a binary mask image in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the contour filled to create a binary mask by the Contour To Mask node?",
        "answer": "The Contour To Mask node fills the contour to create a binary mask by utilizing the drawContours function from OpenCV, drawing the contour onto a zero-filled image of the same shape and converting it to the output format."
