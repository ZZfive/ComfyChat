        "question": "What is the role of the INTConstant node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node in ComfyUI is designed to define and provide a constant integer value that can be used as a fixed input across different computational graphs or pipelines."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input requirement for the INTConstant node?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node requires the input of an integer value ('value') which serves as a fixed and predetermined input for the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the INTConstant node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node is categorized under 'KJNodes/constants' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of output does the INTConstant node provide?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node outputs a constant integer value ('value') of type 'INT' in ComfyUI, which can be used as a fixed input in other nodes or processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which cases might the INTConstant node be particularly useful?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node is particularly useful when a fixed integer input is required for operations in nodes like SVD_img2vid_Conditioning, SetNode, ImageGrabPIL, PixelPerfectResolution, and EmptyLatentImage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type supported by the INTConstant node?",
        "answer": "The INTConstant node in ComfyUI supports the 'CPU' infrastructure type for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'value' input of the INTConstant node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'value' input of the INTConstant node is 0, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 0xffffffffffffffff."
