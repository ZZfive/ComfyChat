        "question": "What is the TriangleWave node in FizzNodes?",
        "answer": "The TriangleWave node in FizzNodes is a custom node that generates a triangular wave pattern based on the provided parameters, including phase, amplitude, and translations along the x and y axes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters determine the pattern of the triangular wave generated by the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The parameters that determine the pattern of the triangular wave are the phase, amplitude, x_translation, and y_translation, as well as the current frame which plays a crucial role in the wave's progression."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'phase' parameter in the TriangleWave node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'phase' parameter in the TriangleWave node determines the period of the triangular wave, affecting how frequently the wave pattern repeats over a given interval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TriangleWave node output in terms of data types?",
        "answer": "The TriangleWave node outputs a tuple where the first element is a float representing the calculated wave value as a float, and the second element is an integer representation of the same calculated wave value."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the output of the TriangleWave node calculated?",
        "answer": "The output of the TriangleWave node is calculated using the formula y_translation+amplitude/np.pi*(np.arcsin(np.sin(2*np.pi/phase*current_frame-x_translation)))."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infra type is used by the TriangleWave node?",
        "answer": "The TriangleWave node uses the CPU as the infra type for its calculations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the TriangleWave node differ from other AnimationScheduling nodes?",
        "answer": "The TriangleWave node specifically generates a triangular wave pattern as opposed to other forms of wave patterns or animation scheduling techniques, making it distinct within the AnimationScheduling category in FizzNodes."
