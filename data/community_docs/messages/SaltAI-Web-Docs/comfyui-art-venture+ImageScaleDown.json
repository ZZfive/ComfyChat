        "question": "What is the ImageScaleDown node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI is designed to reduce the dimensions of an image or a batch of images to a smaller size while maintaining the aspect ratio and optionally center-cropping to fit the specified dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the ImageScaleDown node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the ImageScaleDown node include `images` (torch.Tensor), `width` (int), `height` (int), and `crop` (str) for specifying the scaling and cropping operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageScaleDown node handle center-cropping in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI may center-crop the images after scaling if the `crop` parameter is set to \"center\", ensuring that the images fit the target dimensions by cropping the excess from the center."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the ImageScaleDown node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageScaleDown node belongs to the \"Art Venture/Utils\" category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the possible values for the `crop` input when using the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The possible values for the `crop` input when using the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI are \"disabled\" and \"center\", indicating whether the images should be cropped after scaling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type and dtype of the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI is `IMAGE` with the Python dtype `torch.Tensor`, representing the scaled-down images, potentially cropped to fit the specified dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes are the common nodes that can be used in conjunction with the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The documentation does not specify common nodes that can be used with the ImageScaleDown node in ComfyUI. These nodes would depend on the specific use case and pipeline requirements."
