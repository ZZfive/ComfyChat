        "question": "What is Camera_AnglesStyler?",
        "answer": "Camera_AnglesStyler is a custom node in ComfyUI that belongs to the category ali1234/stylers, designed to manipulate and style 3D model representations by adjusting camera angles, including elevation and azimuth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output node status of Camera_AnglesStyler?",
        "answer": "The output node status for Camera_AnglesStyler is False."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which inputs are required for Camera_AnglesStyler?",
        "answer": "Camera_AnglesStyler requires four inputs: `text_positive`, `text_negative`, `camera_angles`, and `log_prompt`, all with unknown Python dtypes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `camera_angles` input in the Camera_AnglesStyler node?",
        "answer": "The `camera_angles` input in Camera_AnglesStyler is used to specify the camera angles for the 3D model representation, including elevation and azimuth, which are then applied to adjust the perspective of the generated output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Camera_AnglesStyler process the `text_positive` input?",
        "answer": "Camera_AnglesStyler processes the `text_positive` input by conditioning the output with the applied camera angle adjustments, reflecting the specified elevation and azimuth in a positive context."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `text_negative` output in Camera_AnglesStyler?",
        "answer": "The `text_negative` output in Camera_AnglesStyler provides a baseline or control output without the applied camera angle adjustments, which can be used for comparison or as a negative context in the styling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of infrastructure is Camera_AnglesStyler designed to work with?",
        "answer": "Camera_AnglesStyler is designed to work with GPU infrastructure, categorized under infra type `GPU`."
