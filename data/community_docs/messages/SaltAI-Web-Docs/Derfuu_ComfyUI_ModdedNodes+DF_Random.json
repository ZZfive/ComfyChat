        "question": "What is the `DF_Random` node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The `DF_Random` node in ComfyUI is used for generating a random floating-point number within a specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the `DF_Random` node?",
        "answer": "The `DF_Random` node belongs to the category `Derfuu_Nodes/Functions` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input defines the lower bound for the random number range in the `DF_Random` node?",
        "answer": "The lower bound for the random number range in the `DF_Random` node is defined by the input `Value_A`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data type does the `seed` input in the `DF_Random` node have?",
        "answer": "The `seed` input in the `DF_Random` node has the data type `INT` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `seed` input in the `DF_Random` node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` input in the `DF_Random` node provides a seed value for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the generated random numbers across multiple executions."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `DF_Random` node ensure consistent randomness across runs?",
        "answer": "The `DF_Random` node ensures consistent randomness across runs by utilizing the `seed` input, allowing for the same sequence of random numbers to be generated for the same seed value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output data type of the `DF_Random` node?",
        "answer": "The output data type of the `DF_Random` node is `FLOAT`, which is a random floating-point number within the specified range determined by the input bounds and seed."
