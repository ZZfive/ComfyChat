        "question": "What is the Batch Float (mtb) node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float (mtb) node is used to generate a batch of float values with interpolation, offering flexibility in creating sequences of floats based on various easing functions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node generates a batch of float values with interpolation in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Batch Float (mtb) node in ComfyUI generates a batch of float values with interpolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Batch Float (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Batch Float (mtb) node include `mode`, `count`, `min`, `max`, and `easing`, which together control the generation of float values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'mode' input of the Batch Float (mtb) node operate in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'mode' input of the Batch Float (mtb) node specifies the generation mode, either a single replicated value or a sequence of values interpolated in steps."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the number of float values generated by the Batch Float (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The number of float values generated by the Batch Float (mtb) node is determined by the `count` input, directly influencing the length of the output batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which parameters control the range of the generated float values in ComfyUI's Batch Float (mtb) node?",
        "answer": "The `min` and `max` parameters control the range of the generated float values; `min` sets the minimum value and `max` sets the maximum value for the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the Batch Float (mtb) node, how is the progression of the generated float sequence customized?",
        "answer": "The progression of the generated float sequence in the Batch Float (mtb) node is customized through the `easing` selection, which applies a chosen easing function during interpolation."
