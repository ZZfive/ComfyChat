        "question": "What is the purpose of the BatchAverageUnJittered node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node in ComfyUI is designed to process a batch of images by applying an averaging or median operation to reduce jittering effects, creating a smoother, more stable output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the BatchAverageUnJittered node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the BatchAverageUnJittered node are `images`, which is the batch of images to be processed, and `operation`, which specifies whether to use 'mean' or 'median' as the operation to reduce jitter."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the BatchAverageUnJittered node handle the input images?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node applies the specified operation ('mean' or 'median') across the images to create a smoother output, processing the images in sub-batches to reduce jittering effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the BatchAverageUnJittered node provide?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node provides the output type `image`, which is the processed batch of images after applying the specified averaging or median operation to reduce jittering effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the BatchAverageUnJittered node classified within ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node is classified within the 'image/filters/jitter' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the BatchAverageUnJittered node?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node requires 'GPU' infrastructure for execution, which can process the batch of images more efficiently than CPU-based infrastructure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of operation can be specified for the BatchAverageUnJittered node?",
        "answer": "The BatchAverageUnJittered node allows specifying either 'mean' or 'median' as the operation, where 'mean' will apply an averaging operation and 'median' will apply a median operation across the images to reduce jitter."
