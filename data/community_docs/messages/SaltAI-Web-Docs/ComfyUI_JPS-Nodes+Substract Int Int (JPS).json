        "question": "What is the Substract Int Int (JPS) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Substract Int Int (JPS) node is a custom node in ComfyUI that performs subtraction between two integer inputs, providing both integer and floating-point representations of the result."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Substract Int Int (JPS) node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Substract Int Int (JPS) node falls under the category of 'JPS Nodes/Math' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'int_a' input represent in the Substract Int Int (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'int_a' input in the Substract Int Int (JPS) node represents the first integer input for the subtraction operation, serving as the minuend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'int_b' input in the Substract Int Int (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The 'int_b' input in the Substract Int Int (JPS) node is the second integer input for the subtraction operation, acting as the subtrahend."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of outputs does the Substract Int Int (JPS) node have?",
        "answer": "The Substract Int Int (JPS) node has two types of outputs: 'int_substract' as the integer result of the subtraction operation, and 'float_substract' as the floating-point number that provides precision flexibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python representation of the Substract Int Int (JPS) node’s operation?",
        "answer": "The Python representation of the Substract Int Int (JPS) node’s operation is `int_substract = int(int_a) - int(int_b)` for 'int_substract' output, and `float_substract = int(int_a) - int(int_b)` for 'float_substract' output, where `int_a` and `int_b` are the input integers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the comfy dtypes for the inputs and outputs of the Substract Int Int (JPS) node?",
        "answer": "The comfy dtypes for the Substract Int Int (JPS) node are as follows: 'int_a' and 'int_b' as 'INT', 'int_substract' as 'INT', and 'float_substract' as 'FLOAT'."
