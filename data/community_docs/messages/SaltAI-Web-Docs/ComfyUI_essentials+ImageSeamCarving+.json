        "question": "What is the ImageSeamCarving+ node designed for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSeamCarving+ node in ComfyUI is designed for dynamically resizing images while preserving their essential content features through the use of seam carving techniques."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class implements the ImageSeamCarving+ functionality in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageSeamCarving+ functionality is implemented by the class `ImageSeamCarving` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the new width and height dimensions of the image after processing by the ImageSeamCarving+ node?",
        "answer": "The target width and height for the resized image are determined by the `width` and `height` parameters respectively when processing the image with the ImageSeamCarving+ node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input required by the ImageSeamCarving+ node?",
        "answer": "The primary input required by the ImageSeamCarving+ node is the input image (`image`) on which the seam carving algorithm is applied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ImageSeamCarving+ node handle the protection of specific areas during resizing?",
        "answer": "The ImageSeamCarving+ node handles the protection of specific areas during resizing by using an optional keep mask (`keep_mask`), which indicates the areas of the image to be preserved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `energy` parameter in the ImageSeamCarving+ node?",
        "answer": "The `energy` parameter in the ImageSeamCarving+ node specifies the energy calculation mode to determine the importance of pixels in the image, influencing which pixels are prioritized for removal or retention."
    },
    {
        "question": "What hardware is recommended for running the ImageSeamCarving+ node for optimal performance?",
        "answer": "The ImageSeamCarving+ node is recommended to be run on a GPU for optimal performance."
