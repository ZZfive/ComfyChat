        "question": "What is the purpose of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node is designed for decoding images through a layered diffusion process, particularly for handling split image data, optimizing for scenarios where images are divided into frames or layers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'samples' input represent in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node?",
        "answer": "The 'samples' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node represents a collection of sample data crucial for the decoding operation, directly influencing the segmentation, processing, and final quality of the decoded images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the 'frames' input play in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node?",
        "answer": "The 'frames' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node specifies the number of frames or segments into which the images are divided, which is essential for determining how the images are processed and decoded."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node handle different versions of Stable Diffusion models?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node allows selection of the Stable Diffusion model version through its 'sd_version' input, affecting the decoding behavior and the quality of the output images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node is the decoded images processed through the layered diffusion method, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness and quality of the decoding process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which devices does the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node efficiently operate on?",
        "answer": "The Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node operates efficiently on GPU devices, as indicated by its Infra type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'sub_batch_size' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node indicate?",
        "answer": "The 'sub_batch_size' input in the Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node denotes the size of sub-batches for processing, which optimizes resource utilization during the decoding process."
