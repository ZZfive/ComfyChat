        "question": "What is the purpose of the Prompt With Style V2 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Prompt With Style V2 node in ComfyUI is designed to process textual prompts by applying a specified style, removing style syntax, and handling positive and negative prompts differently based on the style, incorporating seed-based modifications to ensure variability in the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the style parameter affect the processing of prompts in the Prompt With Style V2 node?",
        "answer": "The style parameter in the Prompt With Style V2 node determines how the prompts are modified and styled. It plays a crucial role in the output generation process by specifying the exact style transformations applied to the positive and negative prompts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does the seed parameter play in the Prompt With Style V2 node?",
        "answer": "The seed parameter in the Prompt With Style V2 node is used to introduce variability and randomness in the processing of prompts. It affects how wildcards and random syntax are handled within the prompt styling process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which nodes can process prompts by applying a specified style in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Prompt With Style V2 node in the Mikey category can process prompts by applying a specified style in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types generated by the Prompt With Style V2 node?",
        "answer": "The Prompt With Style V2 node generates several output types including 'samples' of type LATENT, conditioning outputs like 'base_pos_cond', 'base_neg_cond', 'refiner_pos_cond', and 'refiner_neg_cond', and processed 'positive_prompt' and 'negative_prompt' of type STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the batch_size parameter affect the processing of prompts in the Prompt With Style V2 node?",
        "answer": "The batch_size parameter in the Prompt With Style V2 node affects performance and output volume. It specifies the number of prompts to process in a single batch."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the CLIP models 'clip_base' and 'clip_refiner' in the Prompt With Style V2 node?",
        "answer": "In the Prompt With Style V2 node, 'clip_base' is the base CLIP model used for encoding the prompts, and 'clip_refiner' is the CLIP refiner model used for refining the encoded prompts further. Both models contribute to the conditioning of the positive and negative prompts."
