        "question": "What is DualCFGGuider?",
        "answer": "DualCFGGuider is a custom node in ComfyUI designed for enhancing the sampling process by applying dual conditional guidance factors to a model."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does DualCFGGuider enable in the generative process?",
        "answer": "DualCFGGuider enables the specification of two distinct conditioning contexts and their respective guidance scales, allowing nuanced control over the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for DualCFGGuider?",
        "answer": "The required input types for DualCFGGuider include: model (MODEL), cond1 (CONDITIONING), cond2 (CONDITIONING), negative (CONDITIONING), cfg_conds (FLOAT), and cfg_cond2_negative (FLOAT)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does DualCFGGuider handle the first conditioning context?",
        "answer": "DualCFGGuider uses the cond1 parameter to specify the first conditioning context, providing a specific direction or theme for the generation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of DualCFGGuider?",
        "answer": "The output type of DualCFGGuider is a configured guider object of type GUIDER, ready to influence the generative model's sampling process with dual conditional guidance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of cfg_cond2_negative in DualCFGGuider?",
        "answer": "cfg_cond2_negative in DualCFGGuider sets the guidance scale for the combination of the second conditioning context and the negative context, fine-tuning their impact on the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can DualCFGGuider be used to guide the model away from certain themes?",
        "answer": "DualCFGGuider utilizes the negative parameter to specify a conditioning context that guides the model away from certain themes or content."
