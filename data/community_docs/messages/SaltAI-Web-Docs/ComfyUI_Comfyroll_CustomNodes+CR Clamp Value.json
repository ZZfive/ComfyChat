        "question": "What is the CR Clamp Value node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Clamp Value node in ComfyUI is designed to restrict a given value within a specified range, ensuring that the output value does not exceed the defined minimum and maximum limits."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CR Clamp Value node belong to?",
        "answer": "The CR Clamp Value node belongs to the category `üß© Comfyroll Studio/üõ†Ô∏è Utils/‚öôÔ∏è Other` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input of the CR Clamp Value node?",
        "answer": "The primary input of the CR Clamp Value node is `a`, which is the value to be clamped and whose final output is constrained within the specified range."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR Clamp Value node handle the 'a' input if it exceeds the range defined by 'range_min' and 'range_max'?",
        "answer": "If the 'a' input is less than 'range_min', it is set to 'range_min'; if 'a' is greater than 'range_max', it is set to 'range_max'; and if 'a' is within the range, it is left unchanged."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CR Clamp Value node output besides the clamped value?",
        "answer": "Besides the clamped value, the CR Clamp Value node outputs a URL to the node's documentation, which is represented by the output `show_help`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the default value for the 'a' input in the CR Clamp Value node?",
        "answer": "The default value for the 'a' input in the CR Clamp Value node is 1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python data type for the 'range_min' input in the CR Clamp Value node?",
        "answer": "The Python data type for the 'range_min' input in the CR Clamp Value node is `float`."
