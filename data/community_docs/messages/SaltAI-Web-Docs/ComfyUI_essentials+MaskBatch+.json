        "question": "What does the MaskBatch+ node in ComfyUI do?",
        "answer": "The MaskBatch+ node in ComfyUI is designed to combine two mask tensors into a single batched tensor, ensuring that the masks are compatible in size before concatenating them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the MaskBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The MaskBatch+ node requires two input types: `mask1` and `mask2`, both of type `MASK` in Comfy dtype, which are represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does MaskBatch+ handle masks of different sizes?",
        "answer": "MaskBatch+ ensures compatibility between masks of different sizes by potentially resizing one of the masks to match the size of the other before concatenating them along the batch dimension."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the MaskBatch+ node produce?",
        "answer": "The MaskBatch+ node outputs a `mask` tensor that is a batched combination of the input masks, potentially after resizing one to match the other's dimensions, represented as `torch.Tensor` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is MaskBatch+ categorized in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "MaskBatch+ is categorized under `essentials` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an infra type of the MaskBatch+ node?",
        "answer": "The infra type of the MaskBatch+ node is `GPU`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the class name of the MaskBatch+ node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the MaskBatch+ node in ComfyUI is `MaskBatch+`."
