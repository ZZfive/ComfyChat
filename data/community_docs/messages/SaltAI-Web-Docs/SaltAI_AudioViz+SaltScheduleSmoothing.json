        "question": "What is the purpose of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSmoothing node is designed to apply a smoothing filter to a schedule list, using a specified smoothing factor to blend between consecutive values, thereby creating a more gradual transition between points in the schedule."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'schedule_list' input represent in the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The 'schedule_list' input in the SaltScheduleSmoothing node represents the sequence of values to be smoothed, serving as the primary data upon which the smoothing operation is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the smoothing_factor influence the output of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "The smoothing_factor in the SaltScheduleSmoothing node determines the degree of smoothing applied to the schedule list. A higher factor results in a smoother transition between points, directly affecting the smoothness of the output."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which dtype does ComfyUI use for the input 'schedule_list' in the SaltScheduleSmoothing node?",
        "answer": "ComfyUI uses the dtype 'LIST' for the input 'schedule_list' in the SaltScheduleSmoothing node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node and what dtype is it represented as?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node is a smoothed version of the input schedule list, represented by the dtype 'LIST' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the SaltScheduleSmoothing node associated with in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleSmoothing node is associated with the 'CPU' infrastructure type in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of the SaltScheduleSmoothing node, what do 'common nodes' refer to?",
        "answer": "In the documentation for the SaltScheduleSmoothing node, 'common nodes' refers to nodes that are frequently used in conjunction with SaltScheduleSmoothing, however, specific examples are not provided."
