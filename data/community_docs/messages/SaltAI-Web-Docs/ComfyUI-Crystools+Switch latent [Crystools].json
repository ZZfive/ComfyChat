        "question": "What is Switch latent [Crystools]?",
        "answer": "Switch latent [Crystools] is a custom node in ComfyUI that allows dynamic selection between two latent representations based on a boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the CSwitchBooleanLatent node do?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node in ComfyUI switches between two latent representations, 'on_true' and 'on_false', depending on a boolean condition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node requires 'on_true' and 'on_false', both of type LATENT, and 'boolean', of type BOOLEAN, to determine which latent representation to output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CSwitchBooleanLatent node determine the output?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node determines its output by evaluating the 'boolean' condition. If 'boolean' is true, it returns 'on_true'; otherwise, it returns 'on_false'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node is LATENT, represented as a tuple in both ComfyUI and Python."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the core functionality of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node?",
        "answer": "The core functionality of the CSwitchBooleanLatent node is conditional selection of latent data streams based on a boolean condition."

        "question": "What infra type does the CSwitchBooleanLatent node support?",
        "answer": "The CSwitchBooleanLatent node supports infra type CPU."
