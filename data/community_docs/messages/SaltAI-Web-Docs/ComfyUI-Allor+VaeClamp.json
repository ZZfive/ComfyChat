        "question": "What is the purpose of the VaeClamp node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node in ComfyUI is designed to pass through Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models without modification, ensuring compatibility or enforcing constraints without altering the VAE model itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the VaeClamp node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node belongs to the 'clamp' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the input type for the 'vae' parameter in the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The input type for the 'vae' parameter in the VaeClamp node is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, with the Comfy dtype being 'VAE' and the Python dtype being 'comfy.sd.VAE'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the VaeClamp node modify the input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model?",
        "answer": "No, the VaeClamp node does not modify the input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. It returns the unmodified VAE model passed into the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type is the VaeClamp node compatible with?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node is compatible with the 'CPU' infrastructure type."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which class in ComfyUI corresponds to the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The VaeClamp node corresponds to the 'VaeClamp' class in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the VaeClamp node?",
        "answer": "The output of the VaeClamp node is the unmodified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that was passed into the node, with the Comfy dtype being 'VAE' and the Python dtype being 'comfy.sd.VAE'."
