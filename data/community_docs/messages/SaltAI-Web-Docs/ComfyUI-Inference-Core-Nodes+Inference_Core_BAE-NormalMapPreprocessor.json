        "question": "What does the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node adjust images to before passing them through the BAE model?",
        "answer": "Before passing images through the BAE model, the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node adjusts them to the required resolution and format."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` input type represent in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node represents the input image to be processed for normal map estimation. It is the primary data that the node operates on, affecting the quality and accuracy of the output normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Comfy dtype for the `image` input type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Comfy dtype for the `image` input type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is `IMAGE`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `resolution` input type allow for in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The `resolution` input type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing. This parameter influences the detail level of the output normal map."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `image` output type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node represent?",
        "answer": "The `image` output type in the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node represents the output normal map generated from the input image, providing a detailed representation of surface normals."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Python dtype for the output of the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtype for the output of the Inference_Core_BAE-NormalMapPreprocessor node is `torch.Tensor`."
