        "question": "What is the ImageQuantize node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The ImageQuantize node in ComfyUI is designed to reduce the number of colors in an image to a specified number, optionally applying dithering techniques to maintain visual quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which types of input does ImageQuantize require?",
        "answer": "ImageQuantize requires three types of input: the input image tensor (`image`), the number of colors to reduce the image to (`colors`), and the dithering technique to be applied (`dither`)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `image` input in the ImageQuantize node?",
        "answer": "The `image` input is the primary data for the ImageQuantize node upon which color reduction is performed. It is the input image tensor that will be quantized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `colors` input affect the operation of the ImageQuantize node?",
        "answer": "The `colors` input directly influences the quantization process of the ImageQuantize node by determining the size of the color palette for the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `dither` input in the ImageQuantize node?",
        "answer": "The `dither` input in the ImageQuantize node determines the dithering technique to be applied during the quantization process, which affects the visual quality and appearance of the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dithering options are available in the ImageQuantize node?",
        "answer": "The ImageQuantize node provides several dithering options: 'none', 'floyd-steinberg', 'bayer-2', 'bayer-4', 'bayer-8', and 'bayer-16'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the ImageQuantize node output?",
        "answer": "The ImageQuantize node outputs a quantized version of the input image, where the color complexity is reduced to the specified number and optionally dithered to maintain visual quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the computation type of the ImageQuantize node?",
        "answer": "The ImageQuantize node has an infra type of 'GPU', indicating that it is optimized for GPU computation."
