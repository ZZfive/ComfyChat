        "question": "What is the RemapPinch node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapPinch node in ComfyUI is designed to apply a pinch distortion effect to images, allowing for the manipulation of image geometry around a specified center point with varying degrees of power."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class does the RemapPinch node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapPinch node belongs to the `Bmad/CV/Transform` category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the RemapPinch node are `power_x`, `power_y`, `center_x`, and `center_y`, all of type `FLOAT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `power_x` parameter affect the output of the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The `power_x` parameter specifies the degree of horizontal pinch effect to apply. Higher values result in more pronounced pinching in the horizontal direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the range of values for the `center_x` parameter in the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The `center_x` parameter in the RemapPinch node ranges from 0 to 1, representing the width of the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the output type `remap` represent in the context of the RemapPinch node?",
        "answer": "The `remap` output type of the RemapPinch node represents a remap output, which is used to apply the specified pinch distortion effect to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which method is used to generate the pinch effect in the RemapPinch node's source code?",
        "answer": "The method `remap_pinch_or_stretch` is used to generate the pinch effect in the RemapPinch node's source code."
