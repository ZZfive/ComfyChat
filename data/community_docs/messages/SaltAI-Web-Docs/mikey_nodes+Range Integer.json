        "question": "What is the Range Integer node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range Integer node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a list of integers within a specified range using a step value derived from a seed, and then selects one integer from this list based on an offset also calculated from the seed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the Range Integer node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Range Integer node belongs to the category `Mikey/Utils` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `start` parameter in the Range Integer node?",
        "answer": "The `start` parameter in the Range Integer node specifies the starting point of the range, setting the lower bound for the generated list of numbers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the step value between each number in the range determined?",
        "answer": "The step value is determined by the `step` parameter and is derived from the seed value, providing a deterministic interval between each number in the range."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of output does the Range Integer node provide?",
        "answer": "The Range Integer node provides two types of output: an `int`, which is a selected integer from the generated list, and a `string`, which is a textual representation of the selected integer."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the `seed` parameter influence the selection of the final number in the Range Integer node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` parameter is used to calculate both the step value and the offset for selecting the final number, ensuring a deterministic selection process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you describe the function of the offset in the Range Integer node?",
        "answer": "The offset is calculated using the `seed` parameter and determines the position within the generated list of numbers to select the final integer."
