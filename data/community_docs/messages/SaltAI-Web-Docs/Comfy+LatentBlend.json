        "question": "What is LatentBlend?",
        "answer": "LatentBlend is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to blend two sets of latent samples together based on a specified blend factor and mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the LatentBlend node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the LatentBlend node are samples1, samples2, and blend_factor."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the 'samples1' input for the LatentBlend node.",
        "answer": "`samples1` is the first set of latent samples to be blended. It serves as the base for the blending operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'blend_factor' input in LatentBlend?",
        "answer": "`blend_factor` is a float value that determines the proportion of the first set of samples in the final blend. A higher value gives more weight to the first set, while a lower value favors the second set."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does LatentBlend create new samples?",
        "answer": "LatentBlend creates new, hybrid samples by blending features from both input sets (samples1 and samples2) according to the specified blend factor and mode."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the LatentBlend node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the LatentBlend node is a set of blended latent samples, represented as `LATENT`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the LatentBlend node?",
        "answer": "The category of the LatentBlend node is '_for_testing'."
