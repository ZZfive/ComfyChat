        "question": "What is the SaltScheduleVariance node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleVariance node in ComfyUI is used to apply a combination of noise-based tremors and easing functions to a schedule list to create a varied output, enhancing the dynamic range and visual interest of scheduled events or animations by introducing controlled randomness and smooth transitions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI can add controlled randomness and smooth transitions to a schedule list?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleVariance node in ComfyUI can add controlled randomness and smooth transitions to a schedule list by applying noise-based tremors and easing functions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the required input for the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The required input for the SaltScheduleVariance node is the `schedule_list`, which is the primary list of scheduled values to be varied."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SaltScheduleVariance node tailor the variance effect of the output?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleVariance node tailors the variance effect of the output through the optional inputs `curves_mode`, `use_perlin_tremors`, `tremor_scale`, `octaves`, `persistence`, and `lacunarity`, which allow for customization of smooth transitions, controlled randomness, and tremor intensity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters control the noise-based tremors in SaltScheduleVariance?",
        "answer": "The parameters `use_perlin_tremors`, `tremor_scale`, `octaves`, `persistence`, and `lacunarity` control the noise-based tremors in SaltScheduleVariance, determining whether tremors are applied, their intensity, the number of noise layers, the smoothness of tremors, and the detail scale of the tremors, respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the SaltScheduleVariance node?",
        "answer": "The output of the SaltScheduleVariance node is the `schedule_list` after noise-based tremors and easing functions have been applied, showcasing the resulting varied list with enhanced dynamics."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which category is the SaltScheduleVariance node found in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SaltScheduleVariance node is found in the `SALT/Scheduling` category in ComfyUI."
