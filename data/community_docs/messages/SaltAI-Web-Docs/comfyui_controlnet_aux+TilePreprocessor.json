        "question": "What is the TilePreprocessor node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor node in ComfyUI is designed to enhance image quality by applying a tiling effect. It preprocesses images for further processing or analysis, focusing on improving the visual aspects or extracting specific features through tiling."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary input for the TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The primary input for the TilePreprocessor node is the input image to be processed. It serves as the primary data for the tiling effect application."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the optional inputs for the TilePreprocessor node?",
        "answer": "The optional inputs for the TilePreprocessor node are 'pyrUp_iters', which specifies the number of iterations for the pyramid upscaling process, and 'resolution', which is the target resolution for the output image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in TilePreprocessor used for?",
        "answer": "The 'pyrUp_iters' parameter in TilePreprocessor is used to specify the number of iterations for the pyramid upscaling process, which affects the intensity of the tiling effect applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes are commonly used in conjunction with TilePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "Commonly used nodes in conjunction with the TilePreprocessor include ControlNetApplyAdvanced, CR Thumbnail Preview, PreviewImage, and ACN_AdvancedControlNetApply."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the TilePreprocessor output?",
        "answer": "The TilePreprocessor outputs an image that has undergone the tiling preprocessing, potentially enhancing certain features or aspects for further analysis. The output image has the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and the Python dtype 'numpy.ndarray'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure type for using TilePreprocessor?",
        "answer": "The infrastructure type for using TilePreprocessor is 'CPU'."
