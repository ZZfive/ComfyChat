        "question": "What is the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI is designed to convert optical flow data into images. This process transforms motion data between two frames into a visual format for interpretation or further processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The category of the RAFTFlowToImage node is under 'jamesWalker55'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for the 'raft_flow' input of the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The 'raft_flow' input of the RAFTFlowToImage node requires a tensor representing the optical flow data. This data is essential for generating the corresponding visual representation of motion between two frames."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the python dtype of the 'image' output of the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The python dtype of the 'image' output of the RAFTFlowToImage node is a torch.Tensor."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function executed by the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI executes the function of converting the optical flows calculated by RAFT algorithms into images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of node is RAFTFlowToImage in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "RAFTFlowToImage is not an output node in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infra type to run the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The infra type to run the RAFTFlowToImage node in ComfyUI is GPU."
