        "question": "What is the purpose of the To Device (mtb) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The To Device (mtb) node is designed to transfer image or mask tensors to a specified computing device such as CPU, GPU, or MPS (Apple Silicon) to facilitate the manipulation of tensor data across different hardware platforms in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'ignore_errors' input in the To Device (mtb) node determine?",
        "answer": "The 'ignore_errors' input in the To Device (mtb) node determines whether to proceed without throwing an error when both image and mask inputs are absent, allowing for flexible error handling in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Python data type does the 'device' input in the To Device (mtb) node correspond to?",
        "answer": "The 'device' input in the To Device (mtb) node corresponds to the Python data type 'str'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'device' input in the To Device (mtb) node support dynamic selection based on available hardware?",
        "answer": "The 'device' input in the To Device (mtb) node supports dynamic selection based on available hardware by specifying the computing device to which the image or mask tensor will be transferred, facilitating hardware-specific tensor operations in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'images' output of the To Device (mtb) node represent?",
        "answer": "The 'images' output of the To Device (mtb) node represents the image tensor after being transferred to the specified device in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which output does the To Device (mtb) node return that corresponds to the mask tensor after it has been transferred to a specified device?",
        "answer": "The To Device (mtb) node returns the 'masks' output, which corresponds to the mask tensor after it has been transferred to the specified device in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function name associated with the To Device (mtb) node's source code?",
        "answer": "The function name associated with the To Device (mtb) node's source code is 'to_device'."
