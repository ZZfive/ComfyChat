        "question": "What is the purpose of the Context (rgthree) node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Context (rgthree) node in ComfyUI serves as a foundational context node, designed for high compatibility with 1.5 applications and other context nodes, focusing on converting input context parameters into a structured output that is optimized for most use cases while maintaining forward and backward compatibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `base_ctx` input represent in the Context (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The `base_ctx` input in the Context (rgthree) node represents the base context to be converted or enhanced, serving as the starting point for the conversion process, allowing for the integration or modification of additional context parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input specifies the model to be used in the Context (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The input that specifies the model to be used in the Context (rgthree) node is called `model`, allowing for customization and flexibility in processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python dtypes for the 'positive' and 'negative' inputs in the Context (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The Python dtypes for the 'positive' and 'negative' inputs in the Context (rgthree) node are both `str`, representing a positive conditioning factor and a negative conditioning factor respectively, which guide and steer the generation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Context (rgthree) node handle images?",
        "answer": "The Context (rgthree) node includes an `images` input, which defines the images to be included in the context, allowing for visual data integration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type represents the structured output context in the Context (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The `CONTEXT` output type represents the structured output context in the Context (rgthree) node, optimized for use in various applications."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of the `seed` input in the Context (rgthree) node?",
        "answer": "The `seed` input in the Context (rgthree) node sets the seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of results throughout the processing."
