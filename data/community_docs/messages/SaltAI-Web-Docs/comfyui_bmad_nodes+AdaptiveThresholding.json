    {
        "question": "How does the AdaptiveThresholding node determine the threshold for each pixel?",
        "answer": "The AdaptiveThresholding node calculates the threshold for a pixel based on the pixel values in its neighborhood, using a specified `block_size` and either mean or Gaussian calculation with the `adaptive_method` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What parameters influence the result of the adaptive thresholding process in the AdaptiveThresholding node?",
        "answer": "The parameters that influence the adaptive thresholding process in the AdaptiveThresholding node are `max_value`, `adaptive_method`, `threshold_type`, `block_size`, and `c`, which respectively determine pixel intensity, adaptive method, threshold comparison, neighborhood size, and threshold adjustment."
