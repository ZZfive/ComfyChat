        "question": "What is Compare Palettes [Dream] in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Compare Palettes [Dream] is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to compare two color palettes by analyzing their brightness, contrast, and RGB color intensities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Compare Palettes [Dream] node output?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes [Dream] node outputs average multipliers for brightness, contrast, and RGB color intensities differences between two input color palettes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required for the Compare Palettes [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes [Dream] node requires two RGB palettes labeled as 'a' and 'b' for comparison, represented in Comfy dtype as RGB_PALETTE."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Compare Palettes [Dream] node calculate brightness differences?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes [Dream] node calculates brightness differences by averaging multipliers derived from comparing the brightness of corresponding colors in two input palettes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'brightness_multiplier' output represent?",
        "answer": "The 'brightness_multiplier' output from the Compare Palettes [Dream] node represents the average multiplier indicating how much brighter the colors are in the second palette compared to the first."
    },
    {
        "question": "What analysis does the Compare Palettes [Dream] node perform on input palettes?",
        "answer": "The Compare Palettes [Dream] node analyzes the input palettes for brightness, contrast, and RGB color intensities to quantify differences between them."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Compare Palettes [Dream] node?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the Compare Palettes [Dream] node in ComfyUI is to provide a quantitative measure of color differences between two RGB palettes based on brightness, contrast, and RGB color intensities."
