        "question": "What is the purpose of the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node in ComfyUI is designed to select one of five conditioning inputs based on a specified selector input. It facilitates dynamic control over which conditioning data is passed forward in a processing pipeline."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node belongs to the 'Searge/_deprecated_/FlowControl' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input_selector in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the input_selector in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node is an integer, denoted as 'INT' and 'int' in ComfyUI and Python types respectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node use the input_selector?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node uses the input_selector to determine which of the five conditioning inputs is passed forward, effectively controlling the flow of data through the node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Comfy dtype and Python dtype for all input options in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "All input options in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node, including input0, input1, input2, input3, and input4, have a Comfy dtype of 'CONDITIONING' and a Python dtype of 'tuple'."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node return and what is its data type?",
        "answer": "The SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node returns the selected conditioning input under the 'output' label, which has a data type of 'CONDITIONING' in Comfy dtype and 'tuple' in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when the input_selector value is 0 in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node?",
        "answer": "When the input_selector value is 0 in the SeargeConditioningMuxer5 node, the output is the first conditioning input option, denoted as input0."
