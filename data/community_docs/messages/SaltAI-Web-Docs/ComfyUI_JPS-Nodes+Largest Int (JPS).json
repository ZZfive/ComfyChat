        "question": "What is the class name of the Largest Int node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The class name of the Largest Int node in ComfyUI is `Largest Int (JPS)`, categorized under `JPS Nodes/Math`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the Largest Int node determine between two given integers?",
        "answer": "The Largest Int node determines the largest and smallest integers between two given values, and also indicates if the first integer is larger than the second."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by the Largest Int node?",
        "answer": "The Largest Int node requires two input types, `int_a` and `int_b`, both of which are integers representing the values to be compared."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Largest Int node handle comparisons between `int_a` and `int_b`?",
        "answer": "If `int_a` is larger than `int_b`, the Largest Int node sets `larger_int` to `int_a`, `smaller_int` to `int_b`, and `is_a_larger` to 1, indicating `int_a` is larger."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do the output types of the Largest Int node represent?",
        "answer": "The output types of the Largest Int node represent `larger_int` (the larger integer between the two inputs), `smaller_int` (the smaller integer between the two inputs), and `is_a_larger` (a flag indicating if the first input integer is larger than the second)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node abstracts the comparison logic for determining the largest integer in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The node that abstracts the comparison logic for determining the largest integer in ComfyUI is the `Largest Int (JPS)` node."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Flag output by the Largest Int node for indicating if `int_a` is larger than `int_b`?",
        "answer": "The flag output by the Largest Int node for indicating if `int_a` is larger than `int_b` is `is_a_larger`, which is 1 if `int_a` is larger, and 0 otherwise."
