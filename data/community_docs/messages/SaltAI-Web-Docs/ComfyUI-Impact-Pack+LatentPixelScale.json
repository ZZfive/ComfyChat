        "question": "What is the main functionality of the LatentPixelScale node in the ImpactPack/Upscale category?",
        "answer": "The LatentPixelScale node is designed to upscale latent representations of images for enhancing image quality or resolution in the latent space before decoding back to pixel space."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the upscale methods provided by the LatentPixelScale node?",
        "answer": "The LatentPixelScale node provides upscale methods such as nearest-exact, bilinear, lanczos, and area."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of using the 'use_tiled_vae' parameter in the LatentPixelScale node?",
        "answer": "The 'use_tiled_vae' parameter determines if the VAE operations should be carried out on tiled representations of the images, which can affect performance and quality, particularly for large images."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'scale_factor' parameter affect the output of LatentPixelScale?",
        "answer": "The 'scale_factor' parameter determines by what factor the latent images are to be upscaled, where a higher scale factor results in a larger output image, affecting the level of detail and resolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What nodes are commonly used with the LatentPixelScale node for processing images in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "Common nodes used with the LatentPixelScale node for processing images in ComfyUI include VAEDecode and KSampler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the LatentPixelScale node?",
        "answer": "The output of the LatentPixelScale node includes the upscaled latent representations in 'latent' format and the decoded image from the upscaled latent representation in 'image' format."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what kind of operations would the LatentPixelScale node typically be used?",
        "answer": "The LatentPixelScale node is typically used in workflows that require high-quality image generation or manipulation, especially in scenarios where the enhancement of image quality or resolution is necessary."
