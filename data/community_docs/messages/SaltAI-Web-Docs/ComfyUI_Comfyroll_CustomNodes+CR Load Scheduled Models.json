        "question": "What is the CR Load Scheduled Models node designed to do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR Load Scheduled Models node is designed to dynamically load and switch between different models based on a predefined schedule for animation frames, enhancing the flexibility and diversity of the generated content."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input determines the operational mode of the CR Load Scheduled Models node?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input determines the operational mode of the CR Load Scheduled Models node, which influences how models are loaded and switched during the animation process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `schedule_alias` input in the CR Load Scheduled Models node?",
        "answer": "The `schedule_alias` input in the CR Load Scheduled Models node serves as an identifier to match the schedule with the correct model, enabling the dynamic loading of models as per the animation frame requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `schedule_format` input specify in the CR Load Scheduled Models node?",
        "answer": "The `schedule_format` input in the CR Load Scheduled Models node defines the format of the schedule, which influences how the schedule is interpreted and applied to model loading."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which input can you specify a default model to be used when no specific model is scheduled for the current frame?",
        "answer": "The `default_model` input is where you specify the default model to be used when no specific model is scheduled for the current frame in the CR Load Scheduled Models node."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node outputs the model, CLIP, and VAE in the Comfyroll Studio category?",
        "answer": "The CR Load Scheduled Models node outputs the `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, and `show_help` based on the current frame and schedule in the Comfyroll Studio category under Animation/Schedulers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the Python data types associated with the `mode` and `current_frame` inputs of the CR Load Scheduled Models node?",
        "answer": "The Python data types associated with the `mode` input of the CR Load Scheduled Models node is `str`, and for the `current_frame` input, it is `int`."
