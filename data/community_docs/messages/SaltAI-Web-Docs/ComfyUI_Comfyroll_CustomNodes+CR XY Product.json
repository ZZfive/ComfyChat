        "question": "What is the CR XY Product node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Product node is used to perform a Cartesian product operation on two lists of text inputs, generating a new list that combines each element of the first list with every element of the second list."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the CR XY Product node belong to in ComfyUI's node library?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Product node belongs to the 'üß© Comfyroll Studio/‚ú® Essential/üìú List/üõ†Ô∏è Utils' category in ComfyUI's node library."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types for the CR XY Product node?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Product node requires two input types: 'text_x' representing the first list of text inputs and 'text_y' representing the second list of text inputs, both treated as separate elements for the Cartesian product operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR XY Product node process 'text_x' and 'text_y' inputs?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Product node processes 'text_x' and 'text_y' inputs by treating each line as a separate element and combining every element of 'text_x' with every element of 'text_y' to form the Cartesian product."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which function is responsible for the Cartesian product in the CR XY Product node's source code?",
        "answer": "The function responsible for the Cartesian product in the CR XY Product node's source code is the 'cross_join' function."
    },
    {
        "question": "What kind of output does the CR XY Product node generate?",
        "answer": "The CR XY Product node generates a list of 'x_values' and 'y_values', which are the first and second elements of each pair in the Cartesian product, respectively, and a 'show_help' URL for additional documentation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'x_values' and 'y_values' in the output of the CR XY Product node?",
        "answer": "The 'x_values' and 'y_values' in the output of the CR XY Product node are lists containing the first and second elements of each pair resulting from the Cartesian product, respectively, which are useful for operations requiring exhaustive pairing of input elements."
