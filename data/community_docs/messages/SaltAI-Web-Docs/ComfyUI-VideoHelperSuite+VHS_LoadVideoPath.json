        "question": "What is the purpose of the VHS_LoadVideoPath node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadVideoPath node in ComfyUI is designed to load video files from specified paths for integration into a video processing workflow, ensuring the file is accessible, the path is valid, and the video is prepared for subsequent tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What class name is associated with the VHS_LoadVideoPath node?",
        "answer": "The class name associated with the VHS_LoadVideoPath node is `VHS_LoadVideoPath`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category under which the VHS_LoadVideoPath node falls?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadVideoPath node falls under the category `Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `video` input in VHS_LoadVideoPath represent?",
        "answer": "The `video` input in VHS_LoadVideoPath specifies the path to the video file to be loaded, allowing the node to access and process the video."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `force_rate` input do in the VHS_LoadVideoPath node?",
        "answer": "The `force_rate` input in VHS_LoadVideoPath determines the frame rate to be enforced on the loaded video, ensuring consistent frame rate processing across different videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the VHS_LoadVideoPath node control the resolution of the loaded video?",
        "answer": "The VHS_LoadVideoPath node allows specifying a desired resolution for the video through its `force_size` input, facilitating the standardization of video sizes for more consistent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `select_every_nth` in the VHS_LoadVideoPath node?",
        "answer": "The `select_every_nth` input in VHS_LoadVideoPath selects every nth frame from the video for loading, which enables sparse sampling of video frames for processing."
