        "question": "What is the purpose of the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The Morphology node in ComfyUI performs image morphology operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, top hat, and bottom hat transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What categories does the Morphology node belong to?",
        "answer": "The Morphology node belongs to the category 'image/postprocessing' in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of operations can be applied using the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "Using the Morphology node, operations such as 'erode', 'dilate', 'open', 'close', 'gradient', 'bottom_hat', and 'top_hat' can be applied to images."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines how the Morphology node modifies image structures?",
        "answer": "The Morphology node modifies image structures based on the chosen morphological operation and the size of the kernel used."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Morphology node process images internally?",
        "answer": "Internally, the Morphology node uses operations like erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, top hat, and bottom hat on images based on the specified parameters."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the output types of the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Morphology node is an image, which has undergone structural modifications according to the selected morphological operation and kernel size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended infrastructure type for using the Morphology node?",
        "answer": "The Morphology node is recommended to be used with GPU infrastructure for efficient image processing."
