        "question": "What is the purpose of the SplitBboxes node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The SplitBboxes node in ComfyUI is designed to divide a list of bounding boxes into two separate lists at a specified index, enabling targeted operations on segmented portions of the data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input parameters for the SplitBboxes node?",
        "answer": "The required input parameters for the SplitBboxes node are 'bboxes' representing the list of bounding boxes to be split, and 'index' specifying the position at which the list should be split."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'bboxes' parameter in the SplitBboxes context?",
        "answer": "In the SplitBboxes context, the 'bboxes' parameter represents the list of bounding boxes to be split, crucial for determining the segments of data to be processed and divided at the specified index."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the 'bboxes' parameter formatted in the SplitBboxes node?",
        "answer": "The 'bboxes' parameter is formatted as a list of tuples in the Comfy dtype 'BBOX', with each tuple containing four integers that define a bounding box."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the 'index' parameter in the SplitBboxes function?",
        "answer": "The 'index' parameter in the SplitBboxes function specifies the position at which the list of bounding boxes should be split, playing a pivotal role in dividing the bounding box list into two distinct parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SplitBboxes node output?",
        "answer": "The SplitBboxes node outputs two lists of bounding boxes: 'bboxes_a' containing elements from the start of the original list up to (but not including) the specified index, and 'bboxes_b' starting from the specified index to the end of the original list."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you explain the return types of the SplitBboxes function?",
        "answer": "The SplitBboxes function returns two values with the Comfy dtype 'BBOX', representing lists of bounding boxes. The first list, 'bboxes_a', contains bounding boxes from the start up to (but not including) the specified index, and the second list, 'bboxes_b', includes bounding boxes starting from the index to the end of the original list."
