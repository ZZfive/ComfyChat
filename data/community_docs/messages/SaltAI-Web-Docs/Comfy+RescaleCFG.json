        "question": "What does RescaleCFG modify?",
        "answer": "RescaleCFG modifies the conditioning and unconditioning scales of a model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does RescaleCFG aim to improve generation?",
        "answer": "RescaleCFG aims to achieve a more balanced and controlled generation process by rescaling the model's output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for RescaleCFG?",
        "answer": "The required input types for RescaleCFG are 'model' of type 'MODEL' and 'multiplier' of type 'FLOAT'."

    {
        "question": "What does the 'patch' function do in the RescaleCFG class?",
        "answer": "The 'patch' function in the RescaleCFG class applies a rescaling function to the model's output, adjusting conditioning and unconditioning scales based on the input parameters."
