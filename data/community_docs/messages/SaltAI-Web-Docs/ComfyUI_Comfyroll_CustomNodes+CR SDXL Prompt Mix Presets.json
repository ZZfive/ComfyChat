        "question": "What is the purpose of the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node is designed to blend and manipulate text prompts and styles according to predefined presets, enabling the creation of nuanced and varied input prompts for generative models."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the positive prompt for global context in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the positive prompt for global context in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node is `STRING`, which is used to generate the global positive prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input is responsible for adding stylistic elements to the positive prompt in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node?",
        "answer": "The `style_positive` input, with dtype `STRING`, is responsible for adding stylistic elements to the positive prompt in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node handle the negative aspect of prompts?",
        "answer": "The CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node handles the negative aspect of prompts by allowing for the customization of the `prompt_negative` and `style_negative` inputs, which serve as the base for generating negative aspects of the final prompt and guiding the generative model away from undesired characteristics."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `preset` input in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node determine?",
        "answer": "The `preset` input in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node determines the specific way in which the positive and negative prompts and styles are combined, offering various creative possibilities."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `pos_l` output in the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node?",
        "answer": "The `pos_l` output is the generated positive prompt for local context. It serves to further refine and direct the model's output by providing context that is locally relevant or specific to certain aspects of the prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where can I find additional help and documentation for using the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node?",
        "answer": "You can find additional help and documentation for using the CR SDXL Prompt Mix Presets node at the URL provided in the `show_help` output, which points to https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes/wiki/SDXL-Nodes#cr-sdxl-prompt-mix-presets."
