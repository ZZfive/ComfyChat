        "question": "What does the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node do in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node in ComfyUI tiles the input latent samples into a grid of configurable dimensions, effectively repeating the samples across a specified number of rows and columns to create a larger, grid-like structure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node requires 'samples', 'columns', and 'rows' as inputs. 'samples' are the latent samples to be tiled into a grid, 'columns' specifies the number of columns in the grid, and 'rows' specifies the number of rows in the grid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output of the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The output of the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node is 'latent' samples arranged in a grid. The original samples are repeated according to the specified rows and columns, and the dtype for the output is 'LATENT'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which category does the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node belong to in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node belongs to the 'Bmad/latent' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'columns' input in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The 'columns' input in the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node specifies the number of columns in the grid, affecting the horizontal repetition of the samples."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which node in ComfyUI is designed to create a grid-like structure from input latent samples?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node in ComfyUI is designed to create a grid-like structure from input latent samples by tiling and repeating them according to specified dimensions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the infrastructure requirement for the Repeat Into Grid (latent) node?",
        "answer": "The Repeat Into Grid (latent) node has an infrastructure requirement of 'GPU', indicating it is optimized for and requires a graphics processing unit to function effectively."
