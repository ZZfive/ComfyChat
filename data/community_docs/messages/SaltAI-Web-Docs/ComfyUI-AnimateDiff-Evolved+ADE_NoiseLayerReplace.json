        "question": "What is ADE_NoiseLayerReplace?",
        "answer": "ADE_NoiseLayerReplace is a custom node in ComfyUI designed to replace specific noise layers within animations or image generation, allowing customization of noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_NoiseLayerReplace allow you to do?",
        "answer": "ADE_NoiseLayerReplace allows you to customize noise patterns by overlaying new noise on existing noise based on a mask, thus creating varied visual textures and effects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the input types required by ADE_NoiseLayerReplace?",
        "answer": "ADE_NoiseLayerReplace requires batch_offset (INT), noise_type (COMBO[STRING]), seed_gen_override (COMBO[STRING]), and seed_offset (INT) as input types."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does seed_gen_override affect ADE_NoiseLayerReplace?",
        "answer": "seed_gen_override in ADE_NoiseLayerReplace allows for custom seed generation strategies that influence the randomness and distribution of noise."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of prev_noise_layers in ADE_NoiseLayerReplace?",
        "answer": "prev_noise_layers in ADE_NoiseLayerReplace specifies the previous configuration of noise layers to be modified, integrating new noise layers into the existing sequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does ADE_NoiseLayerReplace return as output?",
        "answer": "ADE_NoiseLayerReplace returns the modified noise layer configuration (NOISE_LAYERS), incorporating the newly replaced noise layer for subsequent processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you control where noise is replaced in ADE_NoiseLayerReplace?",
        "answer": "You can control where noise is replaced in ADE_NoiseLayerReplace by using the optional mask_optional parameter, which defines a mask for selective application of new noise patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of ADE_NoiseLayerReplace in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "ADE_NoiseLayerReplace functions as a node in ComfyUI's Animate Diff category, specifically for noise layers, providing capabilities to replace and customize noise patterns."
