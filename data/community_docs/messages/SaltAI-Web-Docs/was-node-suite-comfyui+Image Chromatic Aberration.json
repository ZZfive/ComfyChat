        "question": "What is the Image Chromatic Aberration node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The Image Chromatic Aberration node in ComfyUI is used to apply a chromatic aberration effect to an image by adjusting the RGB channels' offsets and intensity, simulating the way light disperses through a lens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required inputs for the Image Chromatic Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The required inputs for the Image Chromatic Aberration node include the image to which the chromatic aberration effect will be applied, the offset values for the red, green, and blue channels, the intensity of the chromatic aberration effect, and the radius over which the chromatic aberration effect fades off."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Image Chromatic Aberration node adjust the RGB channels?",
        "answer": "The Image Chromatic Aberration node adjusts the RGB channels by accepting three offset values for the red, green, and blue channels, along with an intensity parameter that alters the dispersal effect simulated through a lens."
    },
    {
        "question": "What types of data does the Image Chromatic Aberration node's input 'image' use?",
        "answer": "The input 'image' of the Image Chromatic Aberration node uses the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and the Python dtype 'PIL.Image'."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the chromatic aberration effect in ComfyUI's Image Chromatic Aberration node controlled?",
        "answer": "The chromatic aberration effect in the Image Chromatic Aberration node of ComfyUI is controlled through parameters like the intensity of the effect, the offset for each color channel, and the fade radius, which determines how the effect tapers off at the image's edges."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the function of 'intensity' in the Image Chromatic Aberration node?",
        "answer": "The 'intensity' parameter in the Image Chromatic Aberration node determines the strength of the chromatic aberration effect applied to the image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What type of data does the Image Chromatic Aberration node output?",
        "answer": "The Image Chromatic Aberration node outputs an image with the applied chromatic aberration effect, using the Comfy dtype 'IMAGE' and the Python dtype 'PIL.Image'."
