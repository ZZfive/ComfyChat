        "question": "What is CM_Vec4ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ScalarOperation is a custom node in ComfyUI that performs scalar operations on 4-dimensional vectors, allowing manipulation of vector components with a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does CM_Vec4ScalarOperation belong to?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ScalarOperation belongs to the 'math/vec4' category."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for CM_Vec4ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ScalarOperation requires inputs 'op', 'a', and 'b'. 'op' specifies the scalar operation to be performed on the vector, 'a' is the 4-dimensional vector to be transformed, and 'b' is the scalar value applied to the vector."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of CM_Vec4ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The output type of CM_Vec4ScalarOperation is 'VEC4', which represents the transformed 4-dimensional vector resulting from the scalar operation."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does CM_Vec4ScalarOperation facilitate vector transformations?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ScalarOperation facilitates vector transformations by performing operations such as multiplication or division on 4-dimensional vectors, thereby manipulating vector components with a scalar value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What Python data type does the 'op' input correspond to in CM_Vec4ScalarOperation?",
        "answer": "The 'op' input in CM_Vec4ScalarOperation corresponds to a Python string ('str') type."
    },
    {
        "question": "What infrastructure type does CM_Vec4ScalarOperation support?",
        "answer": "CM_Vec4ScalarOperation supports infrastructure type 'CPU'."
