        "question": "What is the Superprompt node in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Superprompt node is a custom node in the KJNodes/text category of ComfyUI that utilizes a T5 model fine-tuned on the SuperPrompt dataset to enhance text prompts with more detailed descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the required input types for the Superprompt node?",
        "answer": "The required input types for the Superprompt node are an `instruction_prompt` (STRING) that provides a guiding instruction for the prompt expansion, a `prompt` (STRING) which is the initial text prompt to be expanded, and `max_new_tokens` (INT) which specifies the maximum number of new tokens to be generated."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the comfy data types for the `instruction_prompt` and `prompt` inputs?",
        "answer": "The comfy data types for both the `instruction_prompt` and `prompt` inputs are STRING."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the Superprompt node improve the performance of text-to-image models?",
        "answer": "The Superprompt node improves the performance of text-to-image models by providing them with more elaborate prompts through the use of a T5 model fine-tuned on the SuperPrompt dataset, which enhances the initial text prompt with more detailed descriptions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output type does the Superprompt node provide?",
        "answer": "The Superprompt node provides a STRING output type which is the enhanced, more detailed version of the original text prompt."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which usage tip is mentioned about Superprompt?",
        "answer": "The usage tip mentioned for Superprompt is its infra type, which is GPU."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `max_new_tokens` input in Superprompt?",
        "answer": "The purpose of the `max_new_tokens` input in Superprompt is to control the length of the expanded prompt by specifying the maximum number of new tokens to be generated."
