        "question": "What is the RemapFromQuadrilateral node in ComfyUI used for?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromQuadrilateral node in ComfyUI is used to transform an image by remapping it from a specified quadrilateral shape to a rectangular shape using homography."
    },
    {
        "question": "What category does the RemapFromQuadrilateral node fall under in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromQuadrilateral node falls under the category `Bmad/CV/Transform` in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What input type is required for specifying the source image mask with four points?",
        "answer": "The input type required for specifying the source image mask with four points is `src_mask_with_4_points`. It should be of the Comfy dtype `MASK` which corresponds to the Python dtype `ndarray`."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'width' and 'height' inputs in the RemapFromQuadrilateral node?",
        "answer": "The 'width' and 'height' inputs in the RemapFromQuadrilateral node define the dimensions of the destination rectangle. They affect the scale and aspect ratio of the transformed image."
    },
    {
        "question": "What output does the RemapFromQuadrilateral node provide?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromQuadrilateral node provides an output of the transformed image data, remapped from the specified quadrilateral to a rectangular shape. This output, denoted as `remap`, is of the Comfy dtype `REMAP` and the Python dtype `ndarray`."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of processor does the RemapFromQuadrilateral node utilize?",
        "answer": "The RemapFromQuadrilateral node utilizes the CPU as its infrastructure type for processing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the custom homography function in the RemapFromQuadrilateral node?",
        "answer": "The custom homography function in the RemapFromQuadrilateral node calculates the homography matrix based on the source image's quadrilateral and destination rectangle's dimensions. This function is used within the transformation process to achieve perspective correction or transformation of the input image."
