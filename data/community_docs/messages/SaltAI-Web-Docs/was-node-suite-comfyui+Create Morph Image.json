        "question": "What is the Create Morph Image node used for in ComfyUI?",
        "answer": "The Create Morph Image node in ComfyUI is designed to generate a morphing animation between two or more images, creating a smooth transition effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input parameters determine the number of frames generated between the starting and ending images in a morphing sequence?",
        "answer": "The number of frames generated between the starting and ending images in a morphing sequence is determined by the `transition_frames` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `still_image_delay_ms` parameter in the Create Morph Image node?",
        "answer": "The `still_image_delay_ms` parameter in the Create Morph Image node defines the duration in milliseconds for which each image remains still before transitioning to the next, enhancing the visual effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which input data type is used to represent an image in the Create Morph Image node?",
        "answer": "The input data type used to represent an image in the Create Morph Image node is `IMAGE`, which is a `torch.Tensor` python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the speed of the morphing animation in the Create Morph Image node?",
        "answer": "The speed of the morphing animation in the Create Morph Image node is determined by the `duration_ms` parameter, which states the duration in milliseconds of each transition step."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the Create Morph Image node repeat the created animation?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Create Morph Image node can repeat the created animation as it allows for loops, which is determined by the `loops` parameter."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is the generated morphing animation saved?",
        "answer": "The generated morphing animation is saved at the file path specified by the `output_path` parameter."
