        "question": "What does the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node do?",
        "answer": "The ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node in ComfyUI is designed to modify the batch size of a given latent representation by resizing the tensor associated with the latent samples according to the specified new batch size and mode, ensuring the latent's structure is maintained while adapting to new batch size requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the category of the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node belongs to the 'InspirePack/Util' category in ComfyUI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node ensure the integrity of data while adjusting its batch size?",
        "answer": "The ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node ensures data integrity during batch size adjustment through resizing the tensor associated with the latent samples, thereby maintaining the structure of the latent representation while adapting it to the specified batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the data type of the input `latent` in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The data type of the input `latent` in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node is `LATENT` in Comfy dtype and `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]` in Python dtype."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `batch_size` input in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The `batch_size` input in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node specifies the target batch size for the latent representation, directly influencing the resizing operation to adapt the representation to the new batch size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the `mode` input in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node determine?",
        "answer": "The `mode` input in the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node determines the method of resizing the latent representation, offering flexibility in how the batch size adjustment is performed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the output type of the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node?",
        "answer": "The output type of the ChangeLatentBatchSize __Inspire node is `LATENT`, which is the resized latent representation conforming to the specified batch size."
