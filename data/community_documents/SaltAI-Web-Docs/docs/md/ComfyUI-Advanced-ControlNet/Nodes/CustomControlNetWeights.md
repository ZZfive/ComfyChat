# ControlNet Custom Weights üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù
## Documentation
- Class name: `CustomControlNetWeights`
- Category: `Adv-ControlNet üõÇüÖêüÖíüÖù/weights/ControlNet`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to load and process custom control net weights, applying specific weight values across a range of parameters and optionally flipping the weights. It's part of the advanced control network system, enabling precise manipulation of the generation process through detailed control weight adjustments.
