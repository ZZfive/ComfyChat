# Select Every Nth Image ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢
## Documentation
- Class name: `VHS_SelectEveryNthImage`
- Category: `Video Helper Suite ðŸŽ¥ðŸ…¥ðŸ…—ðŸ…¢/image`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to filter a batch of images by selecting every Nth image from the batch. It's useful for thinning out image sequences or datasets to reduce processing load or to create a subset of images for specific purposes.
## Input types
### Required
- **`images`**
    - The batch of images to be filtered. This parameter is crucial for determining which images will be included in the output based on the selection criteria.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - Python dtype: `Tensor`
- **`select_every_nth`**
    - Determines the interval at which images are selected from the batch. For example, a value of 2 would mean every second image is selected. This parameter directly influences the size of the output batch.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
## Output types
- **`IMAGE`**
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - The filtered batch of images, containing only every Nth image based on the selection criteria.
    - Python dtype: `Tensor`
- **`count`**
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - The total number of images selected and included in the output batch.
    - Python dtype: `int`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
