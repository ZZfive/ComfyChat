# ðŸ”§ Tensor Shape Debug
## Documentation
- Class name: `DebugTensorShape+`
- Category: `essentials`
- Output node: `True`

This node is designed to analyze and print the shapes of tensors within a given input structure, which can include nested lists, dictionaries, or tensors themselves. It recursively traverses the input to identify and list the shapes of all tensors, providing a clear overview of their dimensions for debugging purposes.
## Input types
### Required
- **`tensor`**
    - The input tensor or a nested structure containing tensors. This parameter is crucial for the node to traverse and identify the shapes of all tensors within the given structure, aiding in debugging tensor dimensions.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Union[torch.Tensor, Dict, List]`
## Output types
The node doesn't have output types
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown

                for k in tensor:
                    tensorShape(tensor[k])
            elif isinstance(tensor, list):
                for i in range(len(tensor)):
                    tensorShape(tensor[i])
            elif hasattr(tensor, 'shape'):
                shapes.append(list(tensor.shape))

        tensorShape(tensor)
        
        print(f"\033[96mShapes found: {shapes}\033[0m")

        return (None,)
