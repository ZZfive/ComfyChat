# How to deploy your ComfyUI workflow to Discord with Salt

This guide walks you through deploying your ComfyUI workflow to Discord using Salt, enabling you to run and share it in any Discord server. Please note that the Salt platform is in early alpha, so you may encounter bugs, and certain operations like loading times could be slower than expected. You can share feedback and get help in our Discord server here: [https://discord.gg/saltai](https://discord.gg/saltai)

## Initial Setup

### Logging Into Salt

- First, head to https://getsalt.ai and sign in or create your account.
- After logging in, click on the ‚ÄúMachines‚Äù tab in the top navigation bar.

### Creating Your Machine

- You‚Äôll notice there are no machines listed initially. To create a new one, click ‚ÄúNew Machine‚Äù.
- Name your machine (for instance, ‚ÄúSalt Comfy‚Äù), then click save. A brief deployment process will follow.

- It might take a few moments to load. Even if it appears unresponsive, it is still processing.

## Preparing your workflow in ComfyUI

### Editing Workflow

- ComfyUI will load with a default workflow interface. Before deployment to Discord, you need to add or adjust nodes to fit the inputs and outputs desired for your Discord workflow.

### Configuring Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: If you want users of your workflow to be able to modify prompts, you need to incorporate the ‚ÄúSalt Flow Input‚Äù node into your workflow. This configuration can also be done locally prior to deployment.
- **Outputs**: Make sure your workflow includes a ‚ÄúSalt Flow Output‚Äù node that defines the type of response (e.g., GIF, PNG, MP4, string) your Discord bot will return.
- To add these nodes, right click to Add Node, then select ‚ÄúSalt‚Äù from the dropdown ‚Äî> IO ‚Äî> Salt Flow Input and Salt Flow Output

## Deploying Your Workflow

### Uploading and Deploying

1. Once you‚Äôre ready to deploy, click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù in the bottom right modal, name your workflow, and use the ‚ÄúLogin with Salt‚Äù function to give Salt access to your workflow. Then click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù again.

### Discord Deployment Submission

- Your workflow requires manual approval by the Salt team before it becomes accessible through the Salt Discord bot. Once approved, it‚Äôs ready for use.

## Executing Your Workflow on Discord

### Adding the Salt bot

1. [**Click here**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1113909066587185274&scope=bot&permissions=2147605568) to add the Salt bot to any server where you have the required permissions

2. Select ‚ÄúBrowse Workflows‚Äù, then ‚ÄúNew Workflows‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚ÄúSelect a recent workflow‚Äù. Find your workflow and click ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù to enter your prompt and run. Based on the type of workflow, you can use text or image to generate your output.

    1. You can also choose ‚ÄúSet default‚Äù to make your workflow the default option when others in the server use the /workflows or /play commands.

### Showcasing your workflows in the Salt catalog

1. To share your workflow with the Salt team and others in the community, first [**join the Salt Discord**](https://discord.gg/saltai) and complete onboarding.
2. Then, head to the [**#flow-catalog**](https://discord.gg/FcbmPDf3E7) channel and follow the example template to share your workflow. Be sure to run it using the Salt bot in a comment below and pin the comment, so others can easily grab and run it themselves.

üí° Note: Your workflow can handle a variety of inputs and outputs for
comprehensive customization. You can expose 5 inputs and 1 output.
